      Why Ambient Music Stopped Trying to Be “Music”

      — Sound as environment, silence as philosophy

    <p>
      Ambient music is not background music. It is not music for focus or productivity.<br>
      It was an attempt to remove music from the foreground — and allow space itself to become perceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This editorial reconstructs the discussion from Podcast Ep-001 through an editorial lens,
      examining Ambient not as a genre, but as a deliberate design of listening.

      <li>Brian Eno’s concept of sound as environment</li>

    <h2>How This Differs from the Podcast</h2>
    <p>
      This is not a transcript or a summary.
      The spoken fragments from the podcast have been dismantled and reassembled
      into an <strong>independent editorial text</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its purpose is to articulate the lingering ambiguities and quiet discomfort
      that remain after listening — and to give them philosophical form.
