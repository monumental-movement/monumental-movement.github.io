M.O.P. (short for Mash Out Posse) is an American hip-hop duo formed by rappers Billy Danz and Lil Fame.

The success of the album "Warriorz" raised M.O.P.'s profile and garnered attention on mainstream radio.However, due to problems with the record company, he faced difficulties around 2002, and was subsequently picked up by Roc-A-Fella Records, where he also appeared on Jay-Z's "The Blueprint: The Gift & the Curse".
