---


A minimal track by Phil Stumpf, who is also a member of the German post-rock band ""OH.'' and also active as the unit ""DUPLEX 100'' with Sam Rouanet.

Released in 2005 on the German house label Tom Bone Vibrating Music.

The second song on Side A is a remix by Gwen Maze.

Phil Stumpf (born 1973 in Germany) has been active as a musician since 1993 and has participated in various bands and projects.

In the late 1980s and early 90s, I was in the indie rock field, and I was fascinated and influenced by bands like Mouse on Mars and Tortoise, as well as electronic music and its minimalist structure.

Having found his way onto the dance floor primarily through his band oh., he discovered minimal groove and began producing club tracks under his own name in 1999.

He will also work as Duplex 100 with his French partner Samuel Rouanat.

In 2001, he moved to Paris and co-founded a club night called ""Minimal Dancin'' at the Nouveau Casino with Samuel Rouanat.

He is currently a member of the Paris-based electronic jazz band Canvas, along with Samuel Rouanat and James Sindertree.
