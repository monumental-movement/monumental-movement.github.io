---


Samuel L is a Swedish tribal techno DJ and producer. "Day n' Night" is a techno track released in 2001 from SSL, which he runs.

The song "Merengue" was remixed by Slam and Oliver Ho in 2002 and became a club hit.

This track represents the changes in the techno scene since the release of the Detroit techno anthem "Knights Of The Jaguar" in 1999, embodying the typical sound of Detroit techno, characterized by powerful bass lines, hard beats, and psychedelic elements.

Needless to say, the success of "Knights Of The Jaguar" had a huge impact on the techno scene, and many artists began pursuing harder and more aggressive sounds, leading techno to evolve into more experimental and avant-garde music.

Samuel L's ""Day n' Night'' is a representative work of techno sound after the groundbreaking ""Knights Of The Jaguar'', which was a turning point in the techno scene, and also had a great influence.

Among the techno tracks from 2001, it's a techno sound right after the millennium, with funky elements intertwined with a straight beat, a pleasant bass drum, no breaks or vocals, just music playing.

This record is a great track that will definitely make any techno lover's day out.
