title: Ian O'Brien – Desert Scores
---


Ian O'Brien is originally a British musicologist who was heavily influenced by the Detroit techno sound, particularly underground resistance.

This sound inspired him to start producing his own music.

This 'Mad Mike Disease' passion led him to produce tracks first with Asad Rizvi under the Memory Tree moniker, and later solo for various UK techno labels.

Released in 1997, ""Ian O'Brien - Desert Scores'' is considered a masterpiece and is still considered part of the tech-jazz genre pioneered by the Galaxy 2 Galaxy EP.
