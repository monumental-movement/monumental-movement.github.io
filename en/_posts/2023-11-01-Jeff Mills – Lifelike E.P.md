title: Jeff Mills – Lifelike E.P
---


"Condor To Mallorca" by Jeff Mills, as the title suggests, is a track with a mystical trip feel, starting with inspired keyboard sounds backed by a calypso-like rhythm program that converges with a kick drum.

The track then takes on a more ominous aspect when the string elements come in.

This EP is a very strong opener with its disturbing musical themes, and "Time After Space" has a cosmic feel.

"Detached" is probably one of his best works.

"Black Avenger" draws listeners in with its percussive frenzy and hard keys.

A must-have for any Jeff Mills fan, this is a special record that covers many of the wide-ranging themes of Jeff Mills' work, while still expressing the unique and powerful results of each individual song.
