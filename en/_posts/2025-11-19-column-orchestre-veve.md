# Chapter 1 Background of the formation and the situation of the Congolese music scene

By the late 1960s, Congolese music had already formed a competitive live culture in the Grande Quartier. As powerhouse bands such as OK Jazz, African Fiesta, and Zaïko competed with each other, and the sophistication of guitar ensembles and vocal polyphony accelerated, the number of independent labels supporting the success of young musicians was increasing.

Orchestra Veve was born amidst this musical fluidity brought about by urbanization and media expansion in the post-independence era. In particular, it was a time when several emerging bands emerged due to the combination of Congo's strong dance culture, the expanding influence of broadcasters, and the demand for performances in street corners bars.

# Chapter 2 Founder Veve Veran and organizational structure

Founder **Veve Verckys** was a saxophonist and a visionary businessman. He had already accumulated know-how in recording management through his activities with OK Jazz, established his own label Veve, and discovered and hired many young performers.

Orchestra Veve is more than just a band.
**Performance team + recording team + production direction + promotion network**
It was highly organized for its time.

Veran's management policy can be summarized in the following three points.

1. **Active recruitment of young guitarists**
2. **Expansion of studio equipment and pursuit of recording efficiency**
3. **Maximizing the danceability of Afro urban music**

These gave birth to Veve's distinctive rhythms and ensembles, which came to fruition during the golden age of the 1970s.

# Chapter 3: Early recordings and the development of rumba congolaise

At the end of the 1960s, Veve initially followed the traditional style of Rumba Congolaise, but made the following changes:

- **Strengthening the guitar's three-layer structure (bass/accompaniment/lead)**
- **Mix that brings the saxophone to the forefront**
- **Use of three-tone harmony for male vocals**

In particular, early recordings such as ""Nakomitunaka" and ""Mfumbwa" have been praised for their strong, linear melodies and enhanced dance characteristics, rather than the traditional meandering lead guitar. In addition, the works from this period introduced the unique ""hanging'' rhythm pattern of the Veve sound, which became the forerunner of the rapid evolution of soukousu later.

---

# Chapter 4 1970s: Maturity of Sound and Golden Age

The early 1970s saw Veve's most creative period. With Veran himself in charge as a recording producer, he was able to achieve a compact recording system and mass releases at the same time.

The reason why this "coexistence of quantity and quality" was possible is as follows.

- **Systematization to maximize the operating rate of your own studio**
- **Rotation system between performers**
- **Reduced recording time per song (one song completed in several hours)**
- **Improved reproducibility by creating ensemble templates**

This article will focus on the following three songs as representative songs born during this golden age.

- **"Zonga Andowe"**
- **"Mfumbwa"**
- **"Nitarudia"**

These songs show the core of Veve's dance music, while also clearly showing the characteristics of the lyrical content, guitar structure, and mixing.

# Chapter 5 Changes in main members and musical characteristics

## Role of lead guitar

Veve's lead guitar was characterized by a sharper "notch" melody than other bands at the time. Especially noticeable in recordings from the 1970s.

- Chromatic leading rise
- fast tremolo
- Short motif repeats of 2-4 bars

was a symbol of the Veve sound. It also influenced the later rapa-lapa and kasekese high-speed guitars.

## Vocal ensemble structure

Veve's vocals are based on **three- to four-part harmony**, with one person maintaining the main melody while the other two or three add counter-melody.
Compared to ZAïko"s single-line music and OK Jazz"s deep harmony-based music, Veve is somewhere in between, with a lot of **light and bright harmonies**.

## Rhythm section innovation

Veve"s rhythm section has a distinctive bounce. The hi-hat doesn"t strongly carve the back of the 16th minute, but instead creates a groove in the 8th minute range with a wide horizontal swing, making it smoother than the soukous of the same period and retaining a texture close to that of a rumba.

# Chapter 6 Analysis of representative songs

## Song A: Zonga Andowe — rhythmic foundation and melodic structure

"Zonga Andowe" is one of Veve's most popular hits, with its repetitive chorus and guitar melodic structure.

### Technical analysis
- **Tempo: approximately 118–122 BPM**
- **Guitar: 3-layer structure (accompaniment guitar emphasizes off-beat)**
- **Bass: Repeat descending line → rising line every 4 bars**
- **Mixing: vocals in the center, guitars separated to left and right**

### Characteristics of rhythm

    C --> D[Off-beat emphasis of guitar accompaniment]
    D --> E[Rumba type groove with a large horizontal oscillation as a whole]

</div>

## Song B: Mfumbwa — melancholy melody and call and response

"Mfumbwa" is a song that symbolizes Veve's "narrative nature of songs" and is beautifully composed of call and response.

### Technical analysis

* **The saxophone presents the melody at the beginning → the guitar imitates**
* **Vocals are "questions" and choruses are "responses"**
* **Linear, high-pitched guitar solo**

### Call and response structure

## Song C: Nitarudia — Dance-oriented soukous eve

In this song, a faster and more segmented guitar appears as a precursor to the soukousu style. It is said to be the most future-oriented sound of Veve's works.

### Technical analysis

* **Hi-hat: 16 minute increments now available**
* **Guitar: When viewed on a pentagram (staff), the arpeggio rises in a staircase pattern**
* **Bass: Phrase that "bounces" in 2-bar units**

### Structure of guitar approach

# Chapter 7 Recording technology, studio environment, production system

Veve's recording environment was one of the most advanced in Africa at the time.
It had its own studio and multiple recording engineers were always present, and had the following technical characteristics.

- **Quickly take advantage of the transition period from 2-4 track recording to 4-8 track recording**
- **Stereo method of swinging the guitar left and right**
- **Mixing that puts the saxophone in the foreground**
- **A pioneering approach that records multiple takes of the chorus and combines them in editing**

One of the characteristics of this work is that it prioritizes the live excitement of the performers rather than spending time on editing, and many of the works are recorded in a structure that is almost like a live recording.

# Chapter 8 Dance culture and reception history: Congo and the diaspora

Veve"s music was very influential in Congo"s urban dance culture.
It is especially popular at bars (dance halls), and each time a band's recording is played, certain steps become established.

* **Style that uses large hand gestures**
* **Steps with strong sideways movement**
* **Applications that incorporate spin**

So much so that the dance was defined for each song.

It was also widespread in the Congolese diaspora (France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom), where recordings of Veve were often placed at the center of dance events in immigrant communities.

---

# Chapter 9 Comparison of Orchestra Veve and other bands

## Difference from Zaïko Langa Langa

* **Zaïko: light, fast, percussion-heavy, long seben**
* **Veve: smooth, rumba-like, saxophone center of gravity, chorus polyphony**

Although both are from the same era, their directions are very different.

## Musical distance with OK Jazz

Veran himself is from OK Jazz, so they have the same sense of harmony and depth of melodic processing, but
Veve is more modern and danceable compared to OK Jazz.

## Commonalities with Afrisa International

Afrisa"s Francophonic flourishes and Veve"s pop brightness have something in common.
Both artists brought the saxophone to the fore around the same time, symbolizing the maturation of musicality due to urbanization.

---

# Chapter 10 Activities in the latter half and independence of members

In the 1980s, the influence of disco and highlife became stronger, and Veve gradually curtailed its activities. On the other hand, former members of the band became independent and took on major roles as solo artists or in other bands.

* Participation in new label
* Overseas migration
* Studio musician activities
* Turned into producer

Veve's genes spread in various ways.

# Chapter 11 Veve Sound Analysis: Rhythm/Guitar Line/Vocal Style

## Rhythm structure

Veve's rhythm structure is characterized by both bounce and straightness.

    B --> C[Light accent on the back of the hi-hat]
    C --> D[Descending base – rising motif]
    D --> E[Smooth, propulsive rhythm]

</div>

---

## Features of guitar line

Veve's guitar has a three-stage structure: **staircase motif → dispersed chords → high-range tremolo**.

## Call and response techniques

The vocal dialogue has a unique ratio of shortening the questioning melody and lengthening the response. This emphasizes the narrative and serves as the hook of the song.

Veve's musical legacy is

* **Increased speed of Soukusu**
* **Saxophone-led urban music**
* **Subdivision of guitar ensemble**
It has had a deep influence on contemporary Congolese music.

In addition, the system-based music production model, which created a recording infrastructure and dynamically nurtured young performers, served as a major guideline for later label management.
