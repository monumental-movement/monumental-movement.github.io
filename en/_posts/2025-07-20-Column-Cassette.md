## Media that preserves memories, not records

Text: mmr｜Theme: Cassette tape, a supporting role in analog music recording


<hr>

### Portable music revolution in the analog era
The cassette tape (Compact Cassette) was developed by Philips in 1963 and became popular throughout the world as one of the leading music media from the 1970s to the 1990s.

- The advent of portable players (Walkmans)

- Easy home recording

- Formation of a culture of personal ownership and exchange of music

Based on this cultural background, cassette tapes became a major platform for analog music.


<hr>

### Historical history of cassette tapes


<hr>

#### 1963: Invention by Phillips

The first compact cassette was introduced for monaural recording.


<hr>

#### 1970s: The beginning of stereo recording and high quality sound

- Popularization of stereo compatible heads

- Standardization of normal (Type I) tape

- With the spread of portable decks, the ""Walkman'' culture was born.

<hr>

#### 1980s: The emergence of high position (Type II) and metal (Type IV)

- Improvement of tape material to improve sound quality

- Improved treble characteristics and expanded dynamic range

- Increased adoption in high-end audio equipment

<hr>

#### 1990s: Decline due to the spread of CDs

However, it continued to be used deeply by some audiophiles, DIY recording culture, hip-hop and indie scenes.

### Types of cassette tapes and their characteristics

Cassette tapes are mainly classified into four types:

### Frequency characteristics and sound quality of cassette tapes


<hr>

#### Basic frequency characteristics

**Normal tape** frequency band is approximately 30Hz to 12kHz

Approximately 20Hz to 15kHz with **chrome tape**

**Metal tape** can be expanded to approximately 20Hz to 18kHz


<hr>

#### Recording head and equalizing

- Recording and playback equalization according to IEC standards differs depending on tape type.

- Realizes high frequency extension with high frequency amplification circuit (ferrite head, etc.)

- Optimize bias signal (high frequency magnetic vibration) to reduce distortion and noise


<hr>

#### Dynamic range and S/N ratio

**Normal type**: S/N ratio of approximately 50-55dB

**Chrome type**: Approximately 60dB

**Metal type**: Performance approaching approximately 70dB


<hr>

### Advantages and disadvantages of cassette tapes


<hr>

#### Advantages

- Portable and easy to handle

- Self-recording and editing possible

- Easy music experience thanks to the spread of cassette players

- Warm sound quality unique to analog


<hr>

#### Disadvantages

- Sound quality deteriorates due to tape wear and is a consumable item.

- Sound quality fluctuates due to head dirt and equipment adjustments

- No need to rewind or fast forward the tape

- Inferior in frequency band and S/N ratio compared to CDs and digital sound sources


<hr>

### Contemporary significance of cassette tape culture

In recent years, cassette tapes have been reevaluated due to the return to analog and the resurgence of retro culture.

- Demand as an indie and hip-hop release format

- Original recording experience and the charm of physical media

- For DIY use of recording equipment and audiophile collection.


<hr>

### summary

Cassette tape is a format that is both convenient and analog-like, occupying an important position in the history of music media.

With the improvement of materials and the development of recording technology, the sound quality has also evolved, and each type has different acoustic characteristics.

Although it is not as good as digital in terms of frequency band and S/N ratio, it continues to be loved for its warm tone and ease of operation.
