As a trivia about the A5 track included in the Snakeman Show "Hurry up and suck it with your mouth!"
There's a hypothetical police interrogation after Paul McCartney's arrest.

The film is based on a fictional police interrogation of Paul McCartney after his arrest in Japan, where he is repeatedly asked for his autograph.

In January 1980, Paul McCartney visited Japan for a performance there. However, when he arrived at Narita Airport, he was arrested for possessing an excessive amount of marijuana. After being detained for several days, McCartney was sentenced to a fine and forced to leave the country.
