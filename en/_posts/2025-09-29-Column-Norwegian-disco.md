## Overview: Scandinavian air and “temperature” disco

The disco created by Norwegian producers is more than just retro playback.The melancholy produced by the cold climate and the fusion of warm synth/percussion--this contrast is the flavor of "Nordic disco."Prins Thomas and Lindstrøm influenced each other, expanding the vocabulary of "space disco" through co-writing and remixing.Mungolian Jet Set, on the other hand, also incorporates elements from outside Norway (including the introduction of music samples from Asia and the Middle East) in its DJ mixes and extraordinary music curation.

### Analysis: Why Norwegian disco is internationally acclaimed

1. **Texture aesthetics**: The coexistence of Scandinavian ways of creating “space” (reverb and spaciousness) with a warm analog feel.
2. **Long track culture**: A style that emphasizes the “journey” through albums rather than clubs.
3. **Cross-cultural references**: Free references to Italo, French disco, and even folk music elements.
