## From Motown star to lonely wanderer to tragic end


Text: mmr | Theme: "Love", "Social Justice", and "Inner Darkness". About Marvin Gaye's music, a "human anthem" that goes beyond the boundaries of soul music


A hotel room in Brussels, 1982.
Marvin Gaye sat alone at the microphone as the dry beat of a Roland TR-808 blared.
""Midnight Love'' was an album of prayer born between exile and rebirth, love and self-destruction.
The man who once led the golden age of Motown and spread the word "sexual healing" to the world eventually ended his life at the hands of his father.
The paradox is that those who continued to sing about love were the ones who were the most hungry for love.
Marvin Gaye's life was the epitome of "the most beautiful, most painful blues" in the history of American music.

## Prologue: Intersection of light and shadow

The life of Marvin Gaye, known as the ""Prince of Soul" and ""Prince of Motown," was filled with family complications, conflicts with himself, constant creative endeavors, and a tragic ending behind his spectacular success. His music was more than just a "pop hit"; it was an amalgamation of social messages, personal confessions, and grooves.

In this article, we will reconsider him not just as a musical genius, but as a human being who lived a ""strange life.'' We will unravel his progress from two axes: changes in music and his own inner oscillations.

## Chapter 1: Early life and early musical activities (1939-1960)

### Childhood and family background
Born Marvin Pentz Gay Jr. on April 2, 1939, in Washington, D.C. Her father, Marvin Gaye Sr., was a church preacher who provided a strict religious education, and her mother, Alberta, was a woman who worked both at home and outside the home. As a child, he grew up singing in the church choir and learning to play the piano and drums.
However, since his childhood, he had been exposed to violence and a controlling attitude from his father, and he was in such a tense state that he later said that he lived with an almighty father who was like a king.

### Approaching Youth, the U.S. Air Force, and Doo-Wop
In the mid-1950s, Gaye enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, but was discharged after a short time due to his rebellion against discipline. His interest in music grew, and he began working with doo-wop groups such as "The Marquees" and "The Moonglows." These activities served as an important foundation for my solo career.
Eventually, he moved to the Detroit/Motown area, and in 1961, he seized the opportunity to make his debut as a solo singer.

### Encounter with Motown
An encounter with Berry Gordy, founder of the Motown label, paved the way for him to become a solo singer. After his debut, while adapting to Motown's system of mass-producing hits for young people, he began to develop a desire for ""adult songs" and ""a voice that speaks volumes."
During this period, he gradually began to realize that he could move from ""just singing" to ""talking through songs."

---

## Chapter 2: Growth as a hit maker (1960s)

### Initial success and struggles with the Motown establishment
In 1962, he had his first hit with "Stubborn Kind of Fellow." After that, he released a series of major hits such as "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)" (1964) and "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" (1968).
At the same time, however, a gap emerged between his desired position as an ""adult crooner" and the ""youth-oriented R&B hit" that Motown wanted, and internal conflict deepened.

### Duet Era: Love and Sadness
During this period, his duet with Tami Terrell was of great significance in his career. Together they achieved success with songs such as "Ain"t Nothing Like the Real Thing" and "You"re All I Need to Get By."
However, the tragedy of Tami Terrell's worsening condition, stage collapse, and death had a deep psychological impact on Gay, accelerating the fluctuations in her inner world.

### The beginnings of self-expression
In 1968, they had one of the biggest hits in Motown history with "I Heard It Through the Grapevine." With this opportunity, she began to change from a singer who makes hits to an artist who has something to say.
The experiences of this period form the background that leads to the turning point of "What"s Going On," which will be covered in the next chapter.

## Chapter 3: Turning Points – From "What"s Going On" to "Here, My Dear" (1970-1976)

### "What"s Going On" (1971): Musical accusation and transformation
On May 21, 1971, the album "What"s Going On" was released. Focusing on social issues such as the Vietnam War, poverty, and environmental destruction, he has established himself as someone who not only sings but also speaks. This was a revolutionary event within the "hit factory" that was Motown.

With this album, he was involved in writing, composing, and producing the album himself, showing his independence as an artist.

### "Let"s Get It On" (1973) and the exploration of sexuality
In 1973"s "Let"s Get It On," she delved deeper into the theme of love/desire, demonstrating her "sex appeal" as a soul singer. There is a clear shift from the former "social accusation" to "inner passion."
During this period, Gaye experienced the joy of creation, as well as the failure of love and financial pressure in his personal life, and these fluctuations cast a shadow on his work.

### "Here, My Dear" (1976) – Establishment as a confessional album
In 1976, he released the album Here, My Dear, which reflected the terms of his divorce from his wife, Anna Gordy. Although this was not a commercial success, it was positioned as a "confession album" that was later reevaluated.
After the release of this album, Gaye was exhausted both physically and mentally and reached a turning point in his life.

## Chapter 4: A period of chaos and rebirth (1977-1983)

### Tax avoidance, escape from Europe, preparation for restart
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, gay men faced many challenges in the United States, including tax problems, drug use, and creative stagnation. Moving to Belgium and spending more time in Europe took on an ""escapism'' both musically and physically.
In the midst of all this, he was looking for a comeback, seeking new sounds and new environments.

### "Midnight Love" (1982)/"Sexual Healing"
On November 8, 1982, Marvin Gaye released his first album after the transfer, ""Midnight Love,'' making a huge comeback.

A major point of this album is the use of the famous Roland TR-808 throughout.

#### Appearance and meaning of Roland TR-808
The Roland TR‑808 (commonly known as ""808'') is an analog/programmable rhythm machine that was introduced in the early 1980s and was not a commercial success at the time.

However, when it was used in songs such as "Sexual Healing," the inorganic sound of the drum machine was fused with a modern "soul mood," and it had a great influence on later soul/R&B/hip-hop.

Specifically, in "Sexual Healing," the bass drum, hi-hat, and clap at the beginning are composed of 808-derived sounds, which creates a contrast between the "mechanical groove" and the "human singing voice" throughout the song.

The production background seems to be that due to production budget and number restrictions at the time, it was necessary to proceed with production using machines rather than using a large band.

This ""fusion of man and machine"' also overlaps with Marvin Gaye"s own life - the sound of his own voice (human) and machine (808), and the frustration and rebirth behind it.

### Last live performance, TV appearance, and death
In 1983, he appeared on the TV show "Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever" and performed classic songs from yesteryear.
However, on April 1, 1984, he was shot by his father, Marvin Gaye Sr., at his parents' home in Los Angeles and passed away at the age of 44.

This sudden tragedy symbolized the antinomy of his life: success and despair, salvation and bondage, and left a strong impression not only in the history of music but also as a human drama.

## Chapter 5: Legacy, influence, and the strange "what ifs"

### Pioneer to the liberation of the music industry and artists
Marvin Gaye was not only a hit maker, but also someone who paved the way for artists to independently create music themselves. The album "What"s Going On" was a work in which he was deeply involved in writing, composing, and producing the lyrics, and had a great influence on subsequent R&B/neo-soul.

Furthermore, the use of the Roland TR-808 on ""Midnight Love'' also showed new possibilities for the fusion of electronic equipment and soul music.

### Personal strange fate
Gay's life is filled with the ""curious" fate of childhood domestic violence, love breakdowns, financial and drug problems, and being shot to death by his father. This trend goes beyond the framework of a mere ""tragic star" and reveals a human image of a man whose ""talent and suffering'' intertwine.
Furthermore, when you think about it from a ""what if" perspective, there are many hypotheses that come to mind: what if he had broken off his relationship with his father, what if he had not been completely trapped in the Motown system, what if he had continued to live. They are evidence of a ""strange life" where chance and necessity intertwine.

### Re-evaluation and expansion of expression in modern times
Even after Gaye's death, his music has been remastered, rediscovered, sampled, and continues to influence new generations today. For example, the discovery of unreleased demo sound sources has also been reported.
In addition, there is a movement to make his life into a film or documentary, and it is gaining recognition not only as a piece of music history but also as a ""human drama.''

## Final chapter: The soul that continues to sing

Looking back on Marvin Gaye's life, it seems that while music itself was his ""salvation," it was also his ""captivity." Through his voice, he continued to sing about the pain of society, the joy of love, and his own struggles.
The words "If you cannot find peace within yourself, you will never find it anywhere else" are attributed to him.
There is a shadow in the light of music, and there is light in the shadow - I think it is this antinomy that makes him more than just a "legend".
His voice continues to be heard throughout time.
I hope that this manuscript provides an opportunity to reconsider Marvin Gaye, his music, and his strange life.
