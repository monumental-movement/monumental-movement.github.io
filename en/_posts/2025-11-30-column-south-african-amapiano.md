## Introduction — Why Amapiano now?

Text: mmr｜Theme: Origins of Amapiano, musical characteristics, history of development, main artists, and process of internationalization

In recent years, the dance music genre **Amapiano**, which originated in South Africa, has been attracting attention not only in Japan but also in club scenes across Africa, Europe, North America, and Asia.

Amapiano is a grassroots music that was born out of the youth culture of townships (low-income urban areas) and nurtured within local communities. Since the 2020s, the spread of streaming and SNS has transformed what was once "underground music" into a global movement.

## Chapter 1: Origins and Musical Roots

### Background as a music genre

Amapiano is influenced by the following genres:

* **Kwaito**: Dance/house music that was popular in urban areas of South Africa in the 1990s
* **Gqom**: Club music originating from Durban
* **Deep house, jazz, lounge, soul/R&B**

In particular, community outreach through township clubs, street parties, taxi ranks, etc. played an important role in the birth of Amapiano.

### Acoustic characteristics

Amapiano's sound consists of the following elements:

* **Log Drum**: A distinctive sound that mixes low bass and woody percussion.
* **Piano/Keyboard**: Genre name "Amapiano" means "pianos" in Zulu
* **Unobtrusive drums and shakers**: Rhythm structures that make use of pauses and blank spaces
* **Tempo**: Slow groove around 110–120 BPM
* **Vocal**: Various styles such as singing, rapping, chorus, etc.

These elements combined to develop music that expressed the youth culture of township clubs and streets.

## Chapter 2: Birth and early development (early to mid-2010s)

### Geography and time

The birthplace of Amapiano is Gauteng, South Africa. Particularly important are the townships of **Johannesburg** and **Pretoria**.

According to multiple sources, experiments with Amapiano began around 2012, and the unified name "Amapiano" as a genre was established later.

### Pioneers and the formation of places

* **MFR Souls (Tumelo Nedondwe & Tumelo Mabe)** contributed to the formation of early Amapiano
* Audio sources are shared among friends and spread via WhatsApp, clubs, parties and taxi ranks
* This DIY/grassroots spread became the foundation for the establishment of the genre.
