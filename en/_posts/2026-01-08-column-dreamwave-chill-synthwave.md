## Overview: What is Dreamwave / Chill Synthwave?

Text: mmr｜Theme: About Dreamwave/Chill Synthwave, a music genre that does not make excessive claims in today's information-overloaded society


Dreamwave and Chill Synthwave are musical styles derived from synthwave that have become clear since the 2010s. While it is based on the synthesizer culture, visual aesthetics, and urban nostalgia of the 1980s, it is distinctive in that it suppresses aggression and retro-futuristic exaggeration, and emphasizes emotion, resonance, and introspection. These are more like aesthetic intentions and design ideas for the listening experience than genres.

Dreamwave has a strong tendency to construct sound images with psychological themes such as fantasy, memory, and dreaming, while Chill Synthwave can be understood as a form that simplifies the tempo and structure and enhances the listenability that blends into living spaces. The two overlap, reinterpreting the ""80s emotion"' in today"s digital environment.

> Both styles do not have clear boundaries and exist continuously, centered around emotional design.

## Historical background: Reinterpretation of 80s culture

The 1980s was a period of transition from analog to digital, and the vocabulary of electronic music expanded explosively with the spread of polyphonic synthesizers, FM sound sources, and the MIDI standard. At the same time, the expanding role of home video, cable television, and film music created a strong connection between music and images.

Around 2010, as the Internet sharing culture matured, past video, sound sources, and design assets began to be recirculated. In this trend, the sound image of the 1980s was not just nostalgic, but became an object to be reconstructed with modern sensibilities. Dreamwave / Chill Synthwave is formed as a reinterpretation that focuses on "scene memory" in particular.

> The 1980s referred to here is more of a collective memory than an actual era.

## Musical features: sound and structure

The musical characteristics of Dreamwave/Chill Synthwave are the transparency of the harmonies, the stability of the tempo, and the slowness of timbre changes. Mainly medium to slow tempos are used, the rhythm is repetitive, and the drum machine is often placed in a restrained manner.

Major 7th, add9, and sus chords are often used for harmonies, and emphasis is placed on a sense of continuity rather than a sense of resolution. Although the melody has a singing heart, it avoids excessive ups and downs, and uses many sustained notes and long notes from lead synths.

In terms of tone, Juno pads, DX electric piano, chorus-processed bass, and spatial effects using delay and reverb play an important role.

> The songs function more as a device to maintain a certain emotional space than as an unfolding story.

---

## Relationship with visual aesthetics

Dreamwave / Chill Synthwave can be understood more deeply when combined with images than the music itself. Cities at dusk, neon lights, coastlines, night drives, and VHS-like textures are frequently referenced.

These visual elements are synchronized with the song"s tempo and tone design, reminding the listener of a scene they"ve seen somewhere before. Images play the role of presenting the situation rather than telling a story.

FM-84 is positioned as one of Dreamwave's representative projects. Characterized by transparent synth pads, lyrical melodies, and restrained beat structures, the songs are often associated with nightscapes and a sense of movement.

FM-84"s work references 80"s AOR and film music sensibilities, but uses modern mixing to avoid an overly retro feel. This creates nostalgia and presentness at the same time.

> FM-84 established Dreamwave as emotional music.

## Artist case study: Timecop1983

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDMWVOq2J6E?si=u9tK-wBO1Czas8H_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Timecop1983 is an artist with strong Chill Synthwave aspects, and is characterized by a simple structure and soft sound image. Rhythm is kept to a minimum, with the melody and chord progression taking center stage.

Although Timecop1983's music is BGM-like, it is designed so that if you listen carefully, you will be able to discern minute changes in tone and harmonic choices.

> The essence of Chill Synthwave is that it blends into the listener's daily life.

---

## Listening environment and consumption pattern

Dreamwave/Chill Synthwave tends to be consumed as ambient music rather than intensive listening. They are often placed in gaps in daily life, such as during night work, transportation, and rest time.

This can be achieved with either headphones or speakers, but since the expansion of the stereo space is particularly important, a playback environment with high spatial reproducibility is preferred.

> This music doesn't divide time, it embraces it.

## Summary: Meaning in modern times

Dreamwave / Chill Synthwave is not an attempt to recreate past musical styles, but a cultural practice that reorganizes memory, emotion, and visual sensation. There, the 1980s is the material, not the purpose.

The reason this style is popular is that in today's information-rich society, there is a need for music that does not make excessive statements. Dreamwave/Chill Synthwave exists in response to that demand.

> This music quietly but persistently affects the emotions.
