## Why field recording?

Text: mmr｜Theme: Covers the history of field recording, characteristics of major equipment, representative recording artists/producers, and recommended albums by generation.


Field recording is the act of leaving the studio and recording the "sounds of the field" as they are. Natural sounds, urban environmental sounds, folk songs, the sounds of railways and factory machines—these are not just sound effects, but cultural archives and musical materials. It is an essential technology for movies, games, music production, and sound art.

### Artist anecdotes that color field recordings

#### Alan Lomax

- The person who popularized ""folk recording" before the term ""field recording."

- When recording labor songs on a farm in the southern United States, he carried a reel-type recorder that was larger than the camera.

- Even the sounds of everyday life (the sound of dishes and people's laughter) were recorded, and these were made into the ""reality of that culture.''

#### Annea Lockwood

- The "River Sound Map" series is made by thoroughly walking around the field and recording it like a scientific survey.

- Due to the long duration of recording, the recording equipment was produced with careful consideration of its power supply and weather resistance.

- Listening to his works gives you the experience of ""traveling through geographical movement with your ears.''

#### Hildegard Westerkamp

- At the sound walk workshop, participants were instructed to ""Listen carefully to the sounds you are hearing right now.''

- Spread the idea of ​​reconsidering urban noise as ""poetry of modern cities" rather than ""noisy garbage."

#### Toshiya Tsunoda

- Understanding the existence of sound as "spatial resonance".

- Example: A microphone is installed in a cavity under the asphalt of a road to record minute vibrations.

- The method is similar to a scientific experiment, but the results are converted into an aesthetic experience.

#### Francisco Lopez

- Hand out "eye masks" to the audience and perform a performance in which they can listen to the sound in total darkness.

- Aims to "erase the boundary between music and environmental sounds."

- For his work ""La Selva,'' he recorded the rainforest as it was, with minimal editing.

#### Chris Watson

- Explored electronic music during his band days. After that, he joined the BBC and was in charge of recording nature programs.

- "El Tren Fantasma" takes you on a journey through an abandoned railway, with detailed recordings of train running sounds and scenery sounds.

- In bird recordings, there is an anecdote of a wild peregrine falcon waiting motionless for several days near its nest.

#### Bernie Krause

- Formerly a synth player who was also involved with The Byrds and Doors.

- After that, he turned to nature recording.

- Proposed the concept of ""Nature's Choir (Biophony)'' and utilized recordings for environmental protection.

#### Ryuichi Sakamoto

- In his later works, he clarified the idea that ""music is inseparable from the environment.''

- Since 2011, he has also recorded local sounds from the Great East Japan Earthquake, deepening his interest in environmental sounds.

- Regarding ""async," he said, ""Music to leave behind fragments of time."

### Anecdotes about each artist and equipment

#### Alan Lomax and Ampex

- Ampex from the 1950s was very large and weighed several tens of kilograms.

- Lomax used this as a mobile studio to record.

- The biggest challenge is securing power, so a generator is used.

#### Chris Watson and Nagra / Sound Devices

- So reliable that he says, ""I've never seen Nagra stop working.''

- I use a super-directional microphone (Sennheiser MKH 416/816) when recording birds and animals.

- I made my own ""waterproof bag + sand cloth'' to protect my equipment from sand in the desert.

#### Nagra by Bernie Krause

- The battery I carried on my back during my early nature recordings weighed over 10kg.

- ""I'm more afraid of missing out than being tired,'' he said.

- Later, with the spread of DAT recorders and lightweight equipment, activities became dramatically more efficient.

#### Francisco López's DAT

- DAT recorders are popular for their high sound quality, but they are sensitive to humidity.

- Tapes deteriorate due to mold in the rainforest, and recording may fail.

- López takes on the challenge of ""leaving the equipment in the natural environment.''

#### Toshiya Tsunoda's DIY Microphone

- I made my own sensors and contact microphones to record the vibrations of the space itself.

- The idea is to ""measure the resonance between air and objects" instead of ""listening to sound."

- Always trying out ""unexpected uses'' for commercially available equipment.

#### Ryuichi Sakamoto and his daily equipment

- In his later years, he always carried pocket-sized Zoom H2n and Sony PCM recorders.

- Create raw materials from the crowds of the city, the sound of rain, the sound of trains, etc.

- Treated equipment as a ""tool to connect daily life and work.''

### The present and future of field recording

Field recording is not just a technique, but an act of creating a "sonic memory." With the spread of high-performance portable equipment and advances in digital archive technology, we have entered an era in which anyone can make high-quality on-site recordings. On the other hand, issues such as ethics (subject consent, cultural attribution) and selection of storage formats remain. If you want to incorporate field recording into your hobby or work, we recommend first going out into the field with reliable equipment and creating a workflow to properly manage and share the recorded sound.
