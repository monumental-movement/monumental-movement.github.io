title: S.I. Futures – We Are Not A Rock Band
---


The tracks Si Begg released on his separate project S. I. Futures proved that electronic music can rock just as much as any other "rock" band.

An unusual funk remix workout by Buckfunk 3000 (also known as Si Begg), the dub mix has a 4/4 house flavor and is a great song.
