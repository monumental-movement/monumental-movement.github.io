## What is Tribal House?


Text: mmr｜Theme: Tribal house that incorporates multi-layered percussion instruments such as African/Latin music (congas, bongos, etc.) to house four-on-the-floor.


Tribal House is a subgenre that combines the four-on-the-floor of house with multi-layered percussion instruments such as African/Latin music (congas, bongos, etc.). It is characterized by an experiential structure that emphasizes percussion, and it developed with deep ties to club floor formats and DJ culture.

## Origin (1988-1994)

**Background of the times**
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chicago/New York club culture began to diverge and diversify from its disco-based house roots. One of its origins is when DJs dug up ethnic and Latin records from around the world and layered a "live percussion feel" on house music through record editing and sampling (this was the era when the long mix culture of clubs grew).

**Points of interest/site**
- In clubs in New York and Chicago in the early 1990s, DJ sets themselves were central to genre expression.
- In the early days, live editing using records and turntables was the mainstream.

**Representative tools (at the time)**
- Turntable: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technics_SL-1200">Technics SL-1200</a> series (standard in the field).
- Drum machines/samplers: Early samplers such as Roland's TR series (TR-909/TR-808, etc.) and Akai became the source of material for kicks and percussion (the history of the TR-909 can be found here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-909">here</a>).

## Maturity and boom (1994-2000)

**Background of the times**
In the mid-90s, labels and compilations that pushed the boundaries of the genre appeared. In particular, <strong>TRIBAL America</strong> from the United States greatly contributed to the formation of the scene (Label information: <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/943-TRIBAL-America">Discogs — TRIBAL America</a>).

**Representative works/people**
- Danny Tenaglia — <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/75189-Danny-Tenaglia-Tourism">Tourism (1998)</a>: An important album of club-oriented tribal expression.
- Deep Dish — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_Science_(album)">Junk Science (1998)</a>: Although it leans toward progressive rock, it is referred to as a work that connects to the club feeling of the 90s.

**Musical features**
- Enhance the floor experience with layered congas and percussion, combinations of sub-bass and powerful kicks, and long repeating compositions.

**Equipment/Production**
- The focus was on sampling with hardware (such as the Akai MPC) and layering of analog/digital drum machines (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akai_MPC">Akai MPC — Wikipedia</a> for the history of the Akai MPC family).

## Transformation and commercialization (2000s)

**Background of the times**
In the 2000s, tribal elements were fused with progressive/electro, etc., and the number of derivative genres increased. The production environment has shifted from being hardware-based to DAW-based, making it possible to create more sophisticated sound designs.

**Change in production method**
- Processing of percussion instruments with extensive use of effect processing (filter/reverb/delay).
- Popularization of "tribal feel that can be easily reproduced" using soft sample packs and plug-ins.

## Revival and Fusion (2010s-present)

**Background of the times**
Globalization and the rise of streaming have accelerated the fusion with Afro house and Latin rhythms. "Hybrid" production, which captures live percussion instruments in high resolution and processes them electronically, has become mainstream.

**Standard equipment on site (currently)**
- Software: Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Native Instruments (Maschine/Kontakt), etc.
- Hardware: MPC series, Elektron equipment, Pioneer CDJ + DVS environment.
- Sample: Utilize a library of high-quality ethnic percussion instruments.

## Ethical considerations
Tribal elements may intersect with discussions of cultural appropriation. When creating/playing, we encourage you to clearly state your origins and show respect for your roots.
