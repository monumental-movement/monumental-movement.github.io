## The connection between reggae and cassette culture


Text: mmr｜Theme: Relationship between reggae and cassette culture based on the historical background


Reggae music is a musical style that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s, and its rhythms and lyrics have been imbued with social and political messages. Its unique music distribution and enjoyment system centered on sound systems set it apart from the commercial record industry. The media called ""cassette tape'' played an important role in this. Cassettes were cheap and easy to copy, and strongly connected local everyday life with reggae culture. Here, we will examine the relationship between reggae and cassette culture, taking into account the historical background.

## Late 1960s to 1970s — Birth of reggae and sound system culture

- **Establishment of Reggae**
Reggae was established around 1968 after ska and rock steady. Lyrics with heavier rhythms, an emphasis on the bass, and messages became popular. It was also during this period that artists such as Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Burning Spear became internationally known.

- **Role of sound system**
In Jamaica, it was difficult to own expensive record players and stereos, so huge sound systems, or groups of speakers installed on street corners, became the center of the musical experience. Producers and DJs independently played the latest 7-inch singles to appeal to the audience.

- **The advent of cassettes**
Compact cassettes, introduced in the early 1970s under the Philips standard, soon found their way into Jamaica. Although it was still in its early stages of popularity, local reggae fans and DJs began to pay attention to the potential of this small media.

## 1980s — Golden age of cassette culture and spread of reggae

- **Popularization of cassettes**
In the 1980s, cassettes became the most popular music medium worldwide. Cheap and easy to carry, with the advent of playback devices such as radio-cassette players and Walkmans, it has become far more familiar than records.

- **Cassette recording in Jamaica**
At sound system events and dance halls, a culture was born in which live recordings were recorded on cassettes and immediately distributed. Although this had some bootleg aspects, it became an important mechanism for packaging and disseminating the enthusiasm of the field.
For example, recordings of specific sound system confrontations (sound clashes) and later distributing them on cassette were a valuable means of sharing experiences for fans.

- **Diaspora and Cassette**
For Caribbean immigrant communities in Britain and the United States, the cassettes sent from Jamaica were a real-time medium that conveyed the ""current state of their homeland.'' Through the mail and informal networks, Jamaica's latest reggae and dancehall music quickly spread overseas.

## 1990s — Dancehall, digitization, and the persistence of cassettes

- **Rise of digital reggae**
After the debut of Sleng Teng in 1985, digital sound became mainstream and dancehall reggae spread around the world. With the mass production of riddims, the rise of MC culture, and the need for speedy distribution, cassettes continued to play an important role.

- **Cassettes and Local Economy**
While official CD releases were in place, unofficial cassette sales flourished on the streets of Jamaica. Mixtapes, sold at markets and food stalls, were a way for ordinary people to obtain the latest sound sources at low prices, and a means of self-promotion for DJs.

- **Relationship with Japan**
Japanese reggae fans and DJs also visited Jamaica in the 1990s and collected local cassettes. These recordings were distributed at club events and record shops, and were directly linked to the development of reggae culture in Japan. Imported cassettes played an important role, especially in the Shibuya and Osaka scenes.

## After the 2000s — Memories of the digital age and cassette culture

- **Rise of CD and MP3**
In the 2000s, CD-R and MP3 file sharing became mainstream, and cassettes gradually disappeared from the market. Music distribution via computers and the Internet has become established in Jamaica, and the role of the cassette as a physical medium has come to an end.

- **Reverberations of cassette culture**
However, the characteristics of cassettes, such as immediacy, on-site enthusiasm, and informal distribution networks, have been inherited by the digital mixtape culture and live recording archives on YouTube. Additionally, amidst the global trend toward a return to analog, there is also a movement to reevaluate cassettes.

- **Rethinking cultural significance**
More than just a recording medium, the cassette symbolized reggae's community-oriented nature, grassroots information distribution, and outlaw independence. Through cassettes, reggae took root as ""their music'' for the masses.

## History of cassette distribution in the Japanese reggae scene

The cassette culture that originated in Jamaica has had a major influence on the Japanese reggae scene since the 1980s. Alongside imported records, **locally recorded cassettes** became an extremely important source of information for Japanese fans and DJs.

- **1980s: Dawn**
At record stores in Shibuya, Tokyo, and Minami, Osaka, sound system recording cassettes brought back from Jamaica were being traded on an underground basis. These were not genuine products, but copies of ""live recordings'' made locally in Jamaica, and supported the earliest dancehall experiences in the Japanese club scene.

- **1990s: The heyday of imported cassettes**
In the 1990s, when the number of Japanese reggae fans rapidly increased, local cassettes were indispensable as a way to learn about the latest riddim. It was brought home by travelers to Jamaica and sold at corners of record stores and event venues. Around **CLUB JAH JAH** in Osaka and **CLUB Citta'** in Shibuya, cassettes functioned as the "front line of information."

- **Introducing an independent mixtape**
As Japanese sound systems (Mighty Crown, Fire Ball, etc.) grew, they started releasing their own mixes on cassette. This led to the fusion of Japan's unique reggae culture and styles imported directly from Jamaica.

- **After 2000s: CD-R and digitalization wave**
In the 2000s, CD-R and MP3 became mainstream, and cassettes gradually disappeared. However, some collectors and DJs still preserve their cassettes and digitize them to give back to the scene. These continue to have value as a vivid archive of reggae's reception in Japan.

- **Cultural Significance**
The distribution of cassettes in the Japanese reggae scene was not just an "imported sound source" but a circuit for directly importing street music. Through cassettes, the Jamaican scene and Japanese clubs were connected, supporting the maturation of the local scene.
