title: '[Column] Six companies that shaped DAW history: Apple / Avid / Steinberg /
  MOTU / Adobe technology history and market strategy'

## Prologue: The evolution of DAW is a story created by the strategies and technological innovations of six companies


Text: mmr｜Theme: Logic/Pro Tools/Steinberg/MOTU/Adobe DAW technology history


As of 2025, the central tool for music production is almost without exception a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).
However, the industry's path to its current form was not simple. It has a complex history spanning more than 40 years of **corporate acquisitions**, **inventing technology standards**, **integrating hardware and software**, and **linking video and broadcasting**.

The following six companies shaped the overall picture:

* **Apple (Logic Pro/GarageBand)**
* **Avid (Pro Tools)**
* **Steinberg (Cubase/Nuendo)**
* **MOTU (Digital Performer)**
* **Adobe (Audition)**
* **emagic/Digidesign (before acquisition)**

The differences in the strategies adopted by these companies have led to the **multipolarization of DAW culture**.
While Apple and Avid pursued "vertical integration" through acquisitions, Steinberg, MOTU, and Adobe established their influence through "technical standards" and "domain specialization."

## 1. 1980s: The era of sequencers and the "four companies that started it"

The origins of DAW history date back to sequencers in the early 1980s.
This was the era of "pure MIDI editing software" before it could handle audio.

### ■ The golden age born of Atari ST

The Atari ST, introduced in 1985, was equipped with a MIDI terminal as standard.
As a result, the following software quickly became popular in Europe.

* **Steinberg – Pro 24 (later Cubase)**
* **C-Lab (later emagic) – Notator**

Steinberg and emagic developed while competing in the same German region.
In particular, Steinberg had most of today's basic UI such as event list, piano roll, and arranger from an early stage.

### ■ Macintosh boosts composition software

In the United States, the spread of Macintosh led to the rise of MOTU.

* **1985: MOTU "Performer"**
* Compatible with the Macintosh graphical UI, many composers have adopted it.

Before digital audio, MOTU and Steinberg started out as composer's tools.

## 2. Early 1990s: Birth of "DAW" and audio revolution

In the 1990s, computers became able to handle audio, and the true nature of DAWs emerged.

### ■ Digidesign Impact: Pro Tools 1.0 (1991)

* 4-track digital recording
* Real-time processing by dedicated DSP
* Realizes a world where you can directly edit waveforms with a mouse

The non-linear editing introduced by Pro Tools was no longer the "concept of tape."

### ■ Steinberg's transformation: Cubase Audio (1992)

* MIDI and audio integration
* Innovative editing features at the time
* **VST 1.0** was introduced in 1996 and had one of the biggest impacts in DAW history.

At this moment, a culture of software acceptance of external plugins began.

### ■ emagic Logic 1.0 (1993)

* Migration from Atari to Mac/Windows
* Equipped with a unique "Environment" function
* Actively introducing soft synths

emagic and Steinberg compete as two major DAWs from Germany.
Digidesign is moving toward becoming the "absolute king of audio editing."

---

## 3. Late 1990s: The era when the tripolar structure was established

In 1996, the biggest turning point in DAW history occurred.

### ■ Steinberg announces VST (1996)

* Effect plugins can be added externally
*In 1999, VST Instrument (VSTi) was standardized as a soft synth.
* Created a culture where sound sources and effects run on a PC

VST later became Apple AU, Digidesign RTAS/AAX, Propellerhead Rack Extensions, etc.
It is the "ancestor" of all plug-in standards.

### ■ MOTU: Enhance video synchronization with Digital Performer 2.0

It was during this period that Hollywood composers began to use DP.
In particular, **SMPTE synchronization and tempo map editing accuracy** were highly praised.
Consolidating its position as a "film music DAW".

### ■ Digidesign: At the heart of your professional studio with Pro Tools|24

* Equipped with dedicated DSP
* Large-scale recording, editing, and mixing possible
* De facto standard in film, broadcasting, and music studios

By this time,
**Composition = Cubase / Logic / DP**
**Editing/finishing = Pro Tools**
A division of roles was established.

---

## 4. Early 2000s: Two acquisitions changed DAW history

At this point, a "corporate acquisition" that changed history decisively occurred.

### ■ 4-1 Apple acquired emagic (2002)

Points confirmed as facts:

* Apple acquired emagic in 2002
* **Terminate the Windows version of Logic and switch to Mac only**
* Carrying over to GarageBand (2004) development
* Logic Pro's price will drop significantly and its popularity will increase
* Significantly increased number of genuine Apple software sound sources and loop materials

This acquisition is
**This is the biggest factor that determined the image of ""music production = Mac''**.

### ■ 4-2 Avid integrates Digidesign (1994→2010)

The acquisition took place in 1994, but the Digidesign brand disappeared in 2010.

*Pro Tools works with Avid Media Composer
*Completely takes over the industry standard for video editing and audio finishing
* The trend of "Avid → Pro Tools" in film production has become established worldwide.

Two companies, Apple and Avid
**Plan to take the lead in the DAW market in terms of both OS and video production**
is completed here.

## 5. 2000–2010s: Steinberg, MOTU, and Adobe's unique strategies

While Apple and Avid have pursued "vertical integration,"
Steinberg, MOTU, and Adobe have grown in power by "strengthening their specialized areas."

### ■ Steinberg: Under Yamaha (2004)

Even after the acquisition, the direction remains unchanged and technological development continues.

* Nuendo enters the post-production market
* Expressive power expanded with VST3 (2006)
* Cubase maintains global share as a composition DAW

### ■ MOTU: Established as the standard for film and TV composers

* The accuracy of video synchronization has further increased in the DP5/6 era
* Being Mac-only makes it compatible with video systems.
* Widely used by musical composers who often use soft synths

### ■ Adobe: Cool Edit → Integrate broadcast editing with Audition

After the acquisition, we will focus on collaboration with Premiere.

* Video editors can adjust the audio directly
* Become a standard on radio stations and podcasts
* It is more of an "editing tool" than a mixer/composition DAW

Here the DAW market is
**Composition/recording/editing/video/broadcasting** will be differentiated according to usage.

## 6. 2010s: The era of nativeization and OS/hardware integration

During this period, DAWs became mainstream with **CPU-dependent native processing**.

### ■ Apple: Logic Pro X (2013)

* UI revamp
* Large amount of soft sound sources
* Lower prices (to the 10,000 yen range)
* Optimization to maximize Mac performance

### ■ Avid: Migration to HDX and AAX

* DSP and native integration
* Pro Tools remains the studio standard
* For large-scale movie mixing, there is almost no choice other than Pro Tools.

### ■ Steinberg, MOTU, and Adobe also continue to update

*Steinberg has updated its VST3 engine.
* MOTU moves into modern workflow with DP9/10
* Adobe's Audition penetration is due to increasing demand for podcasts

By this time, the word "DAW" had become completely common,
Coupled with the expansion of home recording culture, the overall market will expand rapidly.

## 10. Conclusion: The history of DAW is a huge story where "corporate strategy x technical standards x market needs" intersect

Apple acquired emagic and Avid integrated Digidesign.
The DAW market has changed significantly along the axis of **OS x video production x studio infrastructure**.
On the other hand, Steinberg created a historical standard called **VST**,
MOTU has mastered **video synchronization**,
Adobe has created its own market with **integration with broadcast and video editing**.

Although the six companies compete with each other,
As a result, together they have shaped the ""culture of music production itself.''

After 2025, AI editing, cloud collaboration, expansion of mobile production, etc.
The future of DAWs will take on a new dimension.
However, at the root of this is the footprint of the six companies mentioned here.
