## Reconnecting 80s sounds and internet culture

Text: mmr｜Theme: Based on Washed Out, FM-84, Com Truise, etc., about the birth of Chillwave/Synthwave and its relationship with aesthetics, artwork, and internet culture.

**Chillwave** and **Synthwave**, which rapidly spread from the late 2000s to the 2010s, are genres inspired by 1980s electronic music, synthesizers, VHS culture, and retro game aesthetics. However, there is a clear divergence between the two, with two different axes: ""the sound of vague memories" and ""80s revival cinematic sound."

# 1. What is Chillwave?
## 1-1. Birth (around 2009)
Chillwave is generally established around 2009.
The name became popular when the music media ""Hipster Runoff" used the word ""chillwave" in the same year, and it spread as a joke on the Internet.

The characteristics are as follows.

- **Lo-fi recording**
- **Soft texture centered on synth + sampler**
- **Vocal melts into reverb**
- **Influenced by 80's city pop and dream pop**
- **Visuals such as pale colors and blurry photos**

Representative artists:

- **Washed Out** (Ernest Greene)
- Their 2009 EP "Life of Leisure" is considered a masterpiece of the genre.
- **Neon Indian** (Alan Palomo)
- 2009's ""Psychic Chasms'' is a symbolic work of the scene.
- **Toro y Moi** (Chaz Bear)
- Recognized as a major Chillwave act in 2010 with "Causes of This".

Chillwave is somewhere between indie rock and electronica, coinciding with the expansion of bedroom recording environments.

# 2. What is Synthwave?
## 2-1. Formation (mid 2000s to early 2010s)
Synthwave's origins are earlier than Chillwave, and can be traced back to French electronic music (particularly Kavinsky and College) in the mid-2000s.
College & Electric Youth's ""A Real Hero", which was used in the early film ""Drive" (2011), became the catalyst for its mainstream spread.

Features:

- **Music that directly reproduces 1980s movies, science fiction, and synth pop**
- **Focused on analog synths (Juno-106, DX7, Prophet, etc.)**
- **4/4 driving beat (Synthwave)**
- **Slow Ambient (Dreamwave/Retrowave)**
- **Neon, grid, pink x blue 80s visuals**

Main artists:

- **FM-84 (Col Bennett)**
- In 2016, he became a representative of the scene with "Atlas".
- **Mitch Murder**
- Specializes in 80s game music and VHS style sounds.
- **The Midnight**
- Established pop-oriented vocal synthwave.
- **Kavinsky**
- "Nightcall" (2010) is said to be a symbolic song.

Synthwave grew as a large independent genre on the internet throughout the 2010s.

# 3. Difference between the two

| Element | Chillwave | Synthwave |
|------|------------|------------|
| Main periods | 2009-2013 | 2005-present |
| Aesthetics | Blurry memories, summer, nostalgia | Neon, futuristic cities, 80s movies |
| Sound | Lo-fi/dream pop-oriented | Analog synth-centered, sharp sound |
| Representative | Washed Out, Neon Indian | FM-84, Mitch Murder, The Midnight |
| Cultural background | Indie and blog culture | Movies, games, and synth pop revival |

Although they look similar at first glance, **Chillwave has a different direction, ""the ambiguity of memories"**, and **Synthwave has an ""ideal image of 80s movies"**.

# 4. Internet culture and aesthetics
## 4-1. Chillwave and blogging culture
Chillwave was mainly spread through MySpace, Bandcamp, and blogs, and had a strong affinity with the internet's unique low-resolution aesthetic.

Distinctive elements:

- Tropical pattern artwork
- Hazy film photography
- Slow motion footage of abandoned schools, beaches, forests, etc.
- 90's VHS texture

## 4-2. Synthwave and retro SF aesthetics
Synthwave works closely with graphic designers and video creators.
Artwork elements:

- neon sign
- "Outrun color scheme" of pink and blue
- wireframe horizon
- Sports car, sunset
- VHS noise, CRT wind distortion

These are directly connected to the design styles of 1980s science fiction movies, games, and anime.

---

# 5. Equipment/sound creation
The equipment used in Chillwave and Synthwave is also very different.

## Frequently used in Chillwave
- **Soft synths (especially plug-ins from the late 2000s)**
- **Sampler (Akai MPC, SP series)**
- **Cassette recording, lo-fi processing**
- **Electric guitar + effects**

## Frequently used in Synthwave
- **Analog/analog modeling synth**
-Roland Juno-106
- Yamaha DX7
- Sequential Prophet series
-Korg Polysix
- **Drum Machine**
- LinnDrum / LM-1
-Roland TR-707, TR-808
- **80s style gated reverb snare**

The sound itself is close to "reconstruction of 80s movies".

# 9. Detailed analysis of video and design aspects

## 9-1. Influence of 80s movies

Synthwave was heavily influenced by the electronic music and visuals seen in the following films:

* "Blade Runner" (1982)
* "Tron" (1982)
* "Miami Vice" (TV, 1984–1989)
* 1980s arcade game aesthetic

## 9-2. Context of digital revival

Chillwave made extensive use of visual expressions reminiscent of the personal media culture of the 1990s (VHS, camcorders, seaside home footage), and was compatible with the lo-fi photography culture of the Internet (such as early Instagram).

Synthwave's **grid background + neon typography** created by graphic designers has become standardized worldwide, and has also become popular in mix videos on YouTube.

---

# 10. Present and future of both genres

Synthwave is still in high demand as a soundtrack for games and dramas, and is often used in VR and indie games.
Chillwave, on the other hand, is increasingly being talked about as an "indie era" of the 2010s, but has been inherited in the context of dream pop and bedroom pop.

---

# Conclusion

Chillwave and Synthwave both have their origins in the ""80s reappraisal,'' but each moved in a different direction of nostalgia. The former is a **soundscape of vague memories**, and the latter is a **reconstruction of the cinematic 80s world**.
Behind this is the evolution of Internet culture, synthesizer technology, the DIY spirit, and the evolution of video and design.
