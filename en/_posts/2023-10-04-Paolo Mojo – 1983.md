“1983” by Paolo Mojo
While the original itself is a great piece of electronic music, this remix takes the track to a completely different level.

At an incredible 12 minutes long, it has a hypnotic effect that actually makes you want the track to last another 12 minutes. The build-up is quite long, but it has a great melody and ends in complete chaos.
