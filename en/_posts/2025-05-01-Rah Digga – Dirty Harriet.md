title: Rah Digga – Dirty Harriet
---


Dirty Harriet (2000) is the debut studio album by Rahim Fisher, aka Rah Digga, and is an underrated but important piece in hip-hop history.

As the first female member of the Flipmode Squad, with the backing of Busta Rhymes, Rah Digga firmly established herself as a female MC with her masterful lyricism and East Coast boom-bap sound.
