## A device called radio that existed before music

Text: mmr｜Theme: The media of voice that transforms through music - Cultural history from radio to podcasts


Radio is often talked about as a music medium, but its essence when it was first invented was the simultaneous sharing of audio.
News, speeches, readings. Music was one of the main contents, but not the purpose.

However, music was the element most compatible with the radio device.
It transcends language, can withstand long periods of time, can be repeated, and has a direct effect on emotions.
This characteristic leads to an inseparable relationship between radio and music.

>Radio requires music, and music is augmented by radio.

## A system called broadcasting that reorganized music distribution


Until the early 20th century, the distribution of music was bound by physical constraints.
Sheet music, records, concerts. All of these required time and money to access.

Radio broadcasting instantly collapses this structure.
Music will arrive all at once, all at once, and for free.

As a result, the concept of ""fad'' accelerated.
The experience of listening to the same song at the same time has elevated music into a social phenomenon.

> Hit songs were not music that sold, but music that was shared.

---

## Editor of music culture called DJ

Radio has created an existence that presents not only music itself, but also ""how to listen to music.''
The DJ was the music selector, commentator, and storyteller.

Song order, time, and comments.
These give context to the music and define the genre.

The phenomenon of music introduced by a particular DJ being recognized as a genre has been repeated all over the world.
DJs were invisible editors in the formation of music culture.

>Music gained meaning by being played.

---

## Music genres shaped by radio

Jazz, rock, soul, hip hop.
These genres originated as local cultures and were spread by radio.

Broadcast slots fixate genres, and music becomes standardized according to listeners' expectations.
Song length, intro, chorus placement.
The music format itself was optimized for broadcast time.

> Radio cultivated genres and molded them at the same time.

---

## Change of leadership through television and visual culture


Since the 1950s, television has become a central medium for music culture.
Music shifts the center of gravity from an auditory experience to a visual experience.

The arrival of MTV in the 1980s determined this trend.
The success of a song becomes inseparable from its visual expression, and radio loses its role as the first media.

> Music has changed its domain of control from the ears to the eyes.

---

## Decline of radio and shift to "listening while listening"


Caught between television and the Internet, radio will no longer play a leading role.
But it never completely disappeared.

In the car, while working, late at night.
Radio will survive as ""voice that does not require concentration.''

During this period, the music becomes background music and the narrative is simplified.
Although its influence has declined, its pervasiveness in everyday life has remained.

> Radio survived as background sound.

---

## The premise of broadcasting that has been dismantled by the internet

Digitalization will dismantle the fundamental structure of radio.
Time, frequency, license.
These have become unnecessary elements for audio distribution.

On-demand playback obviates the need for simultaneity and the concept of organization.
Radio no longer needs to be a "broadcast".

> Voice has been liberated from radio waves.

---

## Reinventing the podcast

Podcasts were radio without a station.
Produced by individuals, spoken by individuals, and reaching individuals.

Unlike music distribution, podcasts focus on storytelling.
Music becomes an object to be analyzed, remembered, and contextualized.

> Music is no longer being played, but is being talked about.

---

## Role of music podcasts

Modern music podcasts are not aimed at playing songs.
History, background, and personal experience.
Music is treated as a cultural text.

This is a more personal, long-form reimagining of DJ culture from the golden age of radio.

> Even if music is not played, it is played as a part of culture.

---

## The end of the broadcast advertising model


The traditional radio economy relied on advertising.
The structure in which value was determined by viewer ratings and number of viewers was optimized for large-scale broadcasting.

Niche music cultures and specialized narratives are difficult to establish under this model.

> The advertising model limited cultural breadth.

---

## Multi-layered structure of the podcast economy


Podcasts don't have a single revenue model.

Advertising, sponsorship, products, and events.
Multiple revenue streams are combined and creators remain independent.

> Relationships have become more valuable than scale.

## Host Lead Advertising and Trust

Advertisements narrated by the producers themselves are received as part of the program.
This is a different type of contextual consumption than broadcast advertising.

Listeners buy trust in the narrator, not a product.

> Advertisements mediated trust, not attention.

---

## Participatory culture of listener support


Direct support is more than just a fee.
It is a commitment to the continuation of the program and a participation in the community.

Audio media once again has a place.

> The support was an extension of the hearing.
