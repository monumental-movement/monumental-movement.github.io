## Prologue: Why did we accept the "deterioration" of sound as beauty?

Text: mmr｜Theme: Digital distortion has changed music--About the technical history and aesthetics of bit crush and low-bit music


The history of digital music is often talked about as a history of high-quality sound. Sampling frequencies have increased, bit depth has been extended, and noise has been eliminated. However, on the other hand, expressions that intentionally lower the resolution have repeatedly appeared.
Words like bit crush, low bit music, and 8bit/12bit sound technically mean ""limitation" or ""deficiency," but in music history they have formed a distinct aesthetic and culture.

In this column, we will analyze the relationship between bit depth and sound, the limitations of early digital devices, and the flow that led to game consoles, samplers, and DAWs, and interpret the accumulation of facts as to why low-resolution sound became a form of musical expression.

>Digital music has always encompassed both ""enhancing" and ""destructing" at the same time.

## Fundamentals of Digital Sound: What Bit Depth and Sampling Mean


### What is bit depth?

Bit depth is an index that indicates how many levels the amplitude of sound can be expressed.
If it is 16bit, there are 65,536 levels, and if it is 8bit, there are only 256 levels. The smaller the number of stages, the rougher the volume change, and the more noticeable quantization noise appears.

Low bit depths were common in early digital audio equipment due to cost and processing power limitations. This was a design necessity and was not intended.

> Low bit sound first existed as an ""inevitable constraint.''

---

### Relationship with sampling frequency

The sampling frequency is the resolution on the time axis, and the bit depth is the resolution on the amplitude axis.
どちらか一方が低ければ、音は荒れる。だが特にビット深度の低下は、歪みが音色として認識されやすいという特徴を持つ。

この歪みはアナログ歪みとは異なり、非連続的で硬質な質感を持つ。ここに、後年「デジタル的な音」と呼ばれる特徴が生まれた。

> Digital distortion gives the timbre itself a mathematical contour.

## Birth of early digital equipment and low-bit sound


### Digital constraints in the 1970s and 1980s

1970年代後半から80年代初頭にかけて、デジタル音源は研究機関や高価な業務機に限られていた。
For home and commercial devices, memory capacity, computing power, and cost were major constraints, and as a result, low bits and low sample rates were chosen.

Rather than sacrificing sound quality, this was a compromise to make it work.

> Low-bit sound was born as a byproduct of design philosophy.

---

### ゲーム機とサウンドチップ

Family computers, arcade boards, and 8-bit and 16-bit generation game consoles had extremely limited sound source specifications.
The composition of square waves, triangle waves, noise, and simple sample playback gave it a distinctly digital tone.

This sound was considered ""for children" and ""simple," but at the same time it became deeply engraved in generational memory.

> Game music was the biggest medium that allowed low-bit sounds to permeate everyday life.

---

## Culturalization of low-bit music: From constraints to style


### The establishment of chiptune

In the late 1990s, music that intentionally used sound sources from game consoles and old computers came to be called "chip tunes."
これは懐古趣味ではなく、制限された音数・音色の中で作曲するという明確な方法論を伴っていた。

Low-bit sound is not just a matter of sound quality, but has become an element that defines the structure itself.

> Restrictions have been transformed into rules for composition.

---

### DIY culture and online distribution

The spread of the Internet has rapidly democratized music production tools and distribution.
With the advent of emulators, tracker software, and simple synths, low-bit music is leaving the realm of experts.

This trend also connected with later lo-fi-oriented music and indie music.

> Low-resolution sound has entered the high-resolution distribution network.

---

## Operation called bit crush


### Definition of bit crush

Bit crushing is a process of intentionally lowering the bit depth of an audio signal.
This can be implemented in hardware or software, and is also used as real-time processing.

The resulting quantization noise, step-like volume changes, creates a characteristic harshness.

> Bitcrash is not a "reproduction" but a "manipulation".

---

### Establishment as an effect

Since the late 1990s, bit crushers have been installed in DAWs and multi-effects devices.
This was a decisive change that positioned low-bit tones as ""selectable tones.''

Low resolution will no longer be treated as a constraint, but as a means of expression.

> Degradation saved as preset.

---

## Glitch, IDM, and its impact on electronic music


### Contingency and digital noise

Phenomena such as CD reading errors, data corruption, and processing failures should have been eliminated.
However, some electronic musicians begin to treat this as a sound material.

Low-bit noise and glitches have in common that they both assume digital imperfection.

> Digital no longer needs to be perfect.

---

### IDM and acoustic aesthetics

In the context known as IDM, the texture of the sound itself was emphasized as a compositional element.
Bit crushing played a role in shaping texture more than rhythm and melody.

Low bit sounds are like brush strokes in abstract music.

> Resolution gave an axis of expression different from emotion.

---

## Modern low-bit representation


### Hardware Revival

In recent years, 8bit/12bit samplers and lo-fi oriented sound sources have been reevaluated.
This is not just nostalgia; it is because the music production environment has become so high-resolution that the opposite direction has become a clear option.

> Low sound quality is chosen precisely because we live in an era of high sound quality.

---

### Application to videos, games, and advertising

Low-bit tones are used as symbols that instantly convey a sense of nostalgia, artificiality, and unreality.
Even short sounds can evoke context, so they go well with images and UI sounds.

> Low-pitched sounds have become sounds that carry meaning.

## Final chapter: The idea of ​​choosing resolution

Bit crush and low bit music are more than just sound effects or genres.
It is a matter of choosing how precisely to present sound to the world.

As technology advances, limits are no longer imposed from outside.
That's why the act of intentionally lowering resolution involves a clear ideology.

Low bits are not a relic of the past.
It is an aesthetic that will only come to fruition once digital music has matured.

> Choosing the resolution of sound is equivalent to choosing the position of expression.
