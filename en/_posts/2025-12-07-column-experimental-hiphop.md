## Another hip-hop history created by "beat deconstruction experiments" since the 2000s

Text: mmr｜Theme: History of beat experiments, sampling culture, and changes in major works

Experimental Hip Hop and Abstract Hip Hop have developed as trends in hip hop that ""deconstruct and recompose forms.'' In the late '90s, there was a spirit of "structural destruction" presented by Company Flow and Anti-Pop Consortium, and in the 2000s and beyond, Flying Lotus, Shabazz Palaces, Busdriver, Milo, Clipping. and others pioneered their own aesthetics.

In this article, we will summarize the history of beat experiments, sampling techniques, and developments after the LA beat scene based on facts. It also deals with the "swing/slip" culture after J Dilla and its contact with jazz/electronic music/club music, giving an overview of trends up to the 2020s.

## 1. Definition of Experimental Hip Hop / Abstract Hip Hop
The definitions here are based on those used in general criticism and music research papers.

### ● Experimental Hip Hop
- A trend that intentionally deviates from the syntax of hip-hop (rhythm structure, sampling, rap format) and fuses it with surrounding genres such as **electronic music, noise, free jazz, and ambient**.
- Great expansion from the 2000s LA beat scene.
- Focused on producers such as Flying Lotus, Teebs, Daedelus, and Samiyam.

### ● Abstract Hip Hop
- Hip-hop, which was established in the late 1990s and has an "abstract idiom".
- Features abstract wordplay, Stream of Consciousness-like lyrics, and a beat that deviates from the traditional "boom bap" structure.
- Represented by Company Flow, Anti-Pop Consortium, Cannibal Ox, Aesop Rock, etc.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ScYz9sNaQk?si=zZ_87mQGAH6Fc8ik" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## 4. Shabazz Palaces: Redefining abstraction in hip-hop

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNXxd3yYDaM?si=kdXTFpn5kj1KpTDs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Shabazz Palaces was started around 2009, led by Ishmael Butler (formerly of Digable Planets).

### Features
- A combination of West African percussion, psychedelia, ambient and experimental sound.
- Rap is often melodic and cryptographic, and does not rely on the traditional 16-bar structure.
- "Black Up" (2011) is a masterpiece of abstract hip-hop in the 2010s.

## 5. Beat experiment: "misalignment" and non-linear grooves after J Dilla

At the heart of experimental hip-hop since the 2000s is the ""reinvention of rhythm.''

---

### ● Influence of J Dilla
- The "humanized swing" and "drunk beat" found in 2006"s "Donuts" had a decisive influence on later generations.
- His style of not completely following the grid, leaving intentional deviations and disturbances, permeated the LA beat scene and Flying Lotus' work.

### ● Structure of "Drunk Beat"
- Kick and snare are a few milliseconds out of sequence.
- The bass line is also half a step behind the rhythm, creating a fluctuation with body temperature.
- Samiyam, Knxwledge, Mndsgn, etc. inherited this idea.

### ● Intersection with electronic music
- Warp Records introduces a structural approach to electronic music (Autechre, Boards of Canada, etc.).
- The rhythmic language of experimental hip-hop expanded with the introduction of complex polyrhythms and non-repetitive structures.

---

## 6. Sampling culture: from analog to digital

### ● 1990–2000s: MPC culture
- MPC2000/2000XL is mainstream.
- The focus is on "chop culture," in which analog samples are chopped into small pieces and reconstructed.
-Madlib and J Dilla are representative examples.

### ● Late 2000s: Acceleration of DAW introduction
- With the spread of Ableton Live and Reason, **dramatically complex layer configurations** became possible.
- Flying Lotus uses both digital and analog to create a multi-layered soundscape.

### ● 2010s: The era of emphasis on texture
- Teebs "pinhole texture" sampling (mixing fine noise)
- Ethereal sound of Clams Casino (stretched vocal sample)
- Mysterious collage of Shabazz Palaces
This gave rise to a trend that focused on texture.

---

## 7. Expansion since 2010s: Clipping. / Milo / Open Mike Eagle

### ● Clipping. (2010~)

---

- Built under the influence of noise music and connecting experimental electronic music techniques to rap.

---

### ● Milo (R.A.P. Ferreira)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6YVv5pDspfA?si=DfUljTJuFYLK0GAY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## 12. Conclusion: Experimental / Abstract What is Hip Hop?

Experimental/Abstract Hip Hop is not just a derivative genre of hip hop, but an intellectual project that deconstructs rhythmic structures, narratives, sample culture, and electronic music approaches, and continues to this day.

The multi-layered electronic music of Flying Lotus, the abstract rap poetry pioneered by Shabazz Palaces, the non-linear swing of J Dilla, the noise experiments of Clipping.
They continue to function today as a "laboratory for the future of hip-hop."
