## Prologue: The moment when words become sounds

Text: mmr｜Theme: Tracing the history of the evolution of poetry and sound expression since the 20th century, which was born from the combination of voice and words with sound.

Poetry reading and sound art are both often talked about as ""expressions received by the ears.'' However, when one stands at the intersection of the two, what emerges is not just recitation or music, but a unique experience that involves time and space. The voice not only carries meaning, but also takes on texture, rhythm, and physicality, and the sound is freed from melody and harmony and expanded into the environment itself. In this liminal area, poetry has been transformed into an auditory art.

> Knowing the relationship between poetry reading and sound art leads to understanding how the boundaries between words and sounds have been shaken.

## The history of voice begins with poetry reading

### Poetry before letters

Poetry was originally something that was ""spoken'' before it was written. In ancient Greek epics, Japanese storytelling, and African oral poetry, poetry existed alongside voices, conveying communal memories with melodies and rhythms. Meaning and sound were inseparable, and the voice itself was the medium.

### Separation of modern poetry and recitation

With the spread of printing technology, poetry became fixed on paper, and the act of reading shifted to a visual center. From the 19th century to the early 20th century, the recitation of poetry became secondary, and works increasingly tended to be evaluated as texts. However, readings by the poets themselves continued, and the importance of the voice was never completely lost.

> Even in the era when poetry was established on paper, the voice continued to be another place for poetry.

## 20th century avant-garde art and the liberation of voice

### Dada and audio poetry

The Dada movement, born during World War I, rejected meaning and logic and brought sound itself to the fore. Hugo Ball's audio poetry is known for his attempts to break down words into syllables and treat the voice like an instrument. Here, poetry no longer became a means of conveying meaning, but a sound phenomenon itself.

### Futurism and noise

Italian Futurism brought mechanical and urban noise into art. Their reading performances emphasize shouts, onomatopoeia, and rhythm, blurring the boundaries between poetry, music, and noise.

> The avant-garde liberated the voice from meaning and rediscovered it as sound.

## Revolution in magnetic tape and recording technology

### The idea of ​​cutting and pasting voices

In the mid-20th century, the advent of magnetic tape fundamentally changed the way voices were handled. The reading is not a one-time event, but material that can be edited. Techniques such as cut-ups, loops, and reverse rotations brought a new timeline to poetic expression.

### Connection with Musique Concrete

Musique concrète, which uses environmental and everyday sounds as its materials, also influenced poets and readers. Voices are placed as part of the environmental sounds and become elements that compose the space, regardless of their meaning.

> Recording technology has transformed voices into material in time and space.

---

## Beat poets and performances

### Jazz and reading

The Beat Generation of the 1950s brought poetry back to voice and body. A reading at a jazz club becomes a place where improvisation and poetry intersect, creating a living relationship between rhythm and words.

### Poetry as a recording work

Beat poets recorded their readings and released them on records. As a result, the recitation will have independent value as an acoustic work rather than a reproduction of a live performance.

> Poetry has once again become something to be heard and is on the same playing field as music.

---

## Establishment of sound art

### Deviation from music

Since the 1960s, sound art has moved away from the framework of music and has become a form of expression that emphasizes space and the environment. In works developed in galleries and public spaces, the sound changes depending on the movement of the viewer and the passage of time.

### Voice rearrangement

In sound art, the voice separates from the subjectivity of the narrator and becomes a material placed in space. Through multi-channel playback and installations, the voice has become an acoustic object with a sense of direction and distance.

> Sound art has expanded the voice into a spatial entity.

---

## The intersection of poetry reading and sound art

### Expanding collaboration

Collaboration between poets and sound artists began to be seen all over the world from the 1980s onwards. The recitation was incorporated as part of the acoustic environment, and both improvisation and structure were pursued at the same time.

### Cross-media expression

Poetry and sound traverse multiple media through forms such as installation, radio art, and performance. The audience experiences the acts of ""reading," ""listening," and ""walking'' at the same time.

> Works created at intersections create a holistic experience that includes the viewer's body.

---

## Voices and algorithms in the digital age

### Digital processing and voice

Digital technology has made it possible to transform and generate voices in real time. Pitch shifting, granular processing, voice synthesis using AI, etc. expand the expressive realm of poetry.

### Networks and distributed reading

With online distribution and network-based works, readings are not tied to a specific location. There are also an increasing number of cases in which voices emanating from multiple locations compose a single work.

> The digital environment has become a space for dispersing and reintegrating voices.

## Expanded Chapter 1 Reorganization of Radio Art and Recitation

### Voice as a broadcast media

Radio is a medium that has greatly changed the relationship between poetry reading and sound art. In a radio space without visual information, voices and sounds are the only elements that make up the world. The recitation of poetry was combined with background sounds and sound effects, and transformed into an act of creating space through the listener's imagination.

### Program structure and time art

In radio works, the broadcast time itself becomes the structure. Poetry was redefined as a temporal art by stringing together several minute-long poetic fragments to form a single flow.

> Radio has become a testing ground for launching the world with just voice and sound.

---

## Expanded Chapter 2 Physicality and Performance

### The body that gives voice

Poetry reading is an expression that makes one strongly aware of the existence of not only the voice but also the body. Breathing, posture, and movement influence the quality of the voice, and recitation is also linked to visual performance.

### The importance of improvisation

When collaborating with sound art, improvisational vocalizations and reactions are often more important than fixed texts. Poetry becomes a process generated on the spot rather than a completed work.

> Improvisation, including the body, creates a tension between poetry and sound.

---

## Expanded Chapter 3 Language Barriers and Multilingual Reading

### A voice that transcends meaning

Reading aloud in different languages ​​foregrounds the rhythm and intonation of the voice, while the understanding of meaning becomes partial. This has a high affinity with audio poetry and sound art.

### Multicultural space

A sound installation using multilingual reading creates a space where multiple cultural backgrounds resonate simultaneously. The listener engages with the work as an acoustic experience, even without fully understanding its meaning.

> Multilingualism brings the voice closer to pure sound.

---

## Expansion Chapter 4 Records and Archives

### One-time problem

A reading performance is essentially a one-time event. Audio recordings and videos are records of that, not perfect reproductions.

### Sound as an archive

Still, audio archives are an important source of information about the history of poetry and sound art. By listening and comparing voices from different eras, changes in expression become clear.

> Recorded voices connect past time to the present.

---

## Expanded Chapter 5 Education and Workshops

### Reading as a practice

Poetry reading and sound art have been used as creative education methods in educational settings and workshops. Improvisation and recording editing using the voice lower the barrier to expression.

### Possibilities of collective production

Reading and sound production by multiple people creates a collaborative creation that is different from individual poetry production.

> Educational spaces are hotbeds of experimental expression.

---

## Final chapter: Current location of listening poems

The fusion of poetry reading and sound art is not limited to a specific genre. It has been constantly updated and changed along with technology and the social environment. While the voice conveys meaning, it also shapes the space as sound. Through the act of listening, we witness the rich realm that extends between words and sounds.

> The intersection of poetry and sound will continue to create new auditory experiences.
