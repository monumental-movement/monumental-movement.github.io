Boney M.'s Hooray Hooray It's A Holi-Holiday (Hooray! Hooray!) was released in conjunction with the Japan tour at the time, as indicated by the "Japan commemorative edition" written in red Japanese on the jacket.

"Ribbons Of Blue" has more pronounced pedal steel than the regular version, especially in the intro.
