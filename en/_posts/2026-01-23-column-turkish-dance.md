## Introduction｜What is "Turkish Dance Music Circle"?

Text: mmr｜Theme: The historical structure in which traditional dance music and electronic dance music in Türkiye are linked across cities and eras

Turkish dance music does not fit into a single genre or era.
Anatolian folk dances, Ottoman court music, urban popular songs, pop music from immigrant societies, and even modern club music have circulated and influenced each other.

This cyclical structure is understood as a "ring" in this paper.
It is not a linear evolution, but an iterative movement in which traditions are forgotten, rediscovered, and reconnected in different contexts.

> The history of Turkish dance music has been understood as a cycle of repetition rather than a break.

## Base of Anatolian folk dance and rhythm

### Harai, Holon, Zeibek

Each region of Türkiye has its own unique dance music.
東部アナトリアのハライ、西黒海沿岸のホロン、西部エーゲ海地方のゼイベクなどは、いずれも集団性とリズムを重視する構造を持つ。

拍子は2拍子、5拍子、7拍子、9拍子と多様であり、これは後のトルコ系ポップスやダンス音楽にも直接的に影響を与えた。

### Instruments and physicality

サズ（バーラマ）、ズルナ、ダウルといった楽器は、旋律と打撃を明確に分離し、踊り手の身体運動を直接駆動する役割を担う。

この「身体を動かすための音楽」という前提は、電子化以降も一貫して保持されていく。

> Complex time signatures and repetitions were inherited by later generations of dance music.

## オスマン帝国期の都市舞踊音楽

### 宮廷音楽と民衆文化の交差

In the Ottoman Empire, court music and urban popular culture were not completely separated.
At festivals and banquets, there existed a form of performance that integrated dance and music.

### 9拍子の系譜

とくに9/8拍子は、オスマン期から現代に至るまで、トルコのダンス音楽における象徴的リズムとして機能する。

This time signature was reused in later club music as a symbol of ""Turkishness.''

> Rhythms were refined and shared within urban culture.

## 20世紀前半｜録音技術と大衆化

### レコードとラジオの登場

After the 1920s, with the spread of recording technology and radio broadcasting, regional music began to flow into cities.
舞踊音楽もまた、家庭で聴かれる音楽へと変化した。

### オリエンタル・ポップの萌芽

Dance music organized for cities incorporated popular elements and became the basis of later Turkish pop music.

> Dancing music has been reorganized as listening music.

## 1960–70s | Anatolian rock and electrification

### Fusion of folk and rock

In the late 1960s, a movement emerged to fuse Anatolian folk music with rock.
Electric guitars and drums were used as devices to extend traditional dance rhythms.

### Maintaining dance quality

The fusion music of this period was distinctive in that, although it was experimental, it did not lose its dance quality.

> Electrification was accepted as an expansion rather than a rupture.

---

## 1980年代｜ディアスポラと再構築

### ドイツ移民社会の役割

In the 1980s, traditional music and pop music were re-edited in Turkish immigrant communities, mainly in West Germany.

At weddings and community events, emphasized rhythms for dancing were preferred.

### Cassette culture

カセットテープは、低コストかつ流通性の高いメディアとして、ダンス音楽の拡散に寄与した。

> Immigrant society has created a new musical circulation.


---

## 1990s｜Istanbul and club culture

### 都市化とナイトライフ

In the 1990s, club culture expanded in Istanbul.
Songs with local rhythms began to be played alongside house and techno.

### Traditional Rhythm Quotes

DJs and producers sampled nine-time signatures and folk melodies and reimagined them for the dance floor.

> クラブは新たな民俗空間となった。

---

## Since the 2000s | Visualization of globalization and circulation

### ワールドミュージックからクラブへ

Turkish dance music becomes accepted in both world music and club contexts.

### Recursive effects

電子音楽化されたトルコ的リズムが、逆に国内の若手ミュージシャンへ影響を与える循環が生まれた。

> 輪は閉じず、拡張され続けている。

## Final chapter｜Music history as a circle

The history of Turkish dance music is neither a history of progress nor a history of decline.
It is a record of circulation mediated by the body, city, and technology.

Traditions have survived not by being preserved, but by being danced.

> As long as the music is danced, this wheel will continue to turn.
