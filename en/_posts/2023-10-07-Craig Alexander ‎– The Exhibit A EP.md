Craig Alexander has been a fixture in Chicago house music for over 30 years.

My love for music began in the early 80's when I first heard it at "The Music Box" played by the legendary Ron Hardy.Listening to Ron play, he developed a unique style that has rocked dance floors around the world.

He started out promoting parties with Ron Hardy at the legendary club AKA's, but soon he started performing as a disc jockey himself, and many people who heard his sets started offering him headlining gigs.

He has performed with many artists including Glenn Underground, Paul Johnson, DJ Rush, Lil Louis, and Thomas Bangalter (Daft Punk).His musical journey has taken him to many different countries, including France, Switzerland, and Germany.Also, he re-launched "Oblique Records Digital" in 2012.
