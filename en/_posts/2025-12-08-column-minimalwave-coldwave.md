Text: mmr｜Theme: Conditions for the establishment of the genre, regional characteristics, artwork, equipment culture, the process of re-evaluation, and even the contemporary scene

**A movement that rediscovered European underground electronic music from the 70s and 80s and reevaluated it in the 21st century. **
It is a genre that combines the DIY spirit, analog synths, cassette culture, and post-punk coolness.

## 1. Overview: Difference between Minimal Wave and Coldwave
"Minimal wave" and "cold wave" are often confused, but there are clear differences in origin, region, and musicality.

### ● Minimal Wave
- **Main regions: America/Belgium/Netherlands/UK**
- **Center period: 1978-1986**
- **Characteristics: Mainly analog synths, minimal structure, more rustic and experimental than techno pop**
- Mainly DIY cassette culture and independent distribution labels
- Systematized by NY label **Minimal Wave Records (Veronica Vasicka)** in the 2000s

### ● Coldwave
- **Main region: Central Europe centered on France/Belgium**
- **Center period: 1979-1989**
- **Characteristics: Post-punk influence, cold voice, dark melody**
- Many band formations (bass + drum machine + synth)
- Typical examples include Asylum Party, Trisomie 21, Little Nemo, etc.

It is easy to understand if you understand it as follows:

**Minimal Wave** = DIY electro + experimental minimal

**Coldwave** = Post-punk + synth + dark and cold mood

## 2. Background of the birth of the genre: electronic music revolution from the late 70s to the 80s

### ● 2-1. Technological innovation: Popularization of analog synths
In the late 1970s, the price of synthesizers fell, making them affordable to ordinary musicians.
Representative models:
- **Korg MS-10 / MS-20**
- **ARP Odyssey**
- **Roland SH-101**
- **Sequential Circuits Pro-One**
- **Roland TR-606/TR-808 (drum machine)**

It is now possible to create music using a standalone synth + 4-track cassette recorder, instead of using expensive modular equipment.

### ● 2-2. Influence of punk/post-punk
- The punk idea that "anyone can make music"
- Dark images of Joy Division, The Cure, Siouxsie, etc.
- Combining these with electronic instruments, **dark, cold, minimal electronic music** was born.

### ● 2-3. Rise of cassette culture and independent labels
- Popularization of cassette MTR (Tascam Portastudio, etc.)
- Tape trading culture exchanged by mail
- Small labels by region:
- Belgium: Insane Music
- France: New Rose, Lively Art
- UK: Neon Judgment series independent performance environment

This became the basis of Minimal Wave/Coldwave.

## 3. Regional characteristics

### ● UK/USA: Center of Minimal Wave
- Oppenheimer Analysis (UK)
- Turquoise Days (UK)
- Eleven Pond (US, New York)
- Martin Dupont (France but also re-evaluated in the context of Minimal Wave)

There are many people who symbolize the DIY trend of electronic music.
In particular, **Oppenheimer Analysis**'s "The Devil's Dancers" was later reissued by Minimal Wave Records and became a signature song.

### ● France/Belgium: the center of Coldwave
- Trisomie 21 (FR)
- Asylum Party (FR)
- Little Nemo (FR)
- War Office Propaganda (BE)

There are many combinations of guitar + synth + drum machine, and it has a strong post-punk tone.

### ● Germany/Netherlands: Minimal synth-oriented electronic experiments
- Absolute Body Control (BE)
- Das Ding (NL)

It has a strong minimalist approach to electronic acoustics, and comes into contact with later EBM.

## 4. Sound: Analysis of musical characteristics

### ● 4-1. Minimal structure
- Repeat loop of 2-4 bars
- Changes are subtle such as opening/closing filters and adjusting envelopes.
- Baselines are often generated with a sequencer

### ● 4-2. Synth sound
- Thick square wave/sawtooth wave
- More monaural and rustic texture than stereo
- Minimum analog delay/reverb

### ● 4-3. Vocal characteristics
- "Cold" voice with suppressed emotions
- Dry mix with less reverb
- Female vocalist (Cécile of Deux) is also important

### ● 4-4. Beat
- TR-606, DR-55 dry kick and hat
- Patterns are simple and mechanically repetitive

---

## 5. Artwork: The origin of minimal design

Minimal Wave/Coldwave records and cassettes share a common aesthetic.

### ● 5-1. Geometric design
- Grid, linear, pointillist, symbolic layouts
- Inorganic color palette such as black, white, and metallic colors

### ● 5-2. How to use photos
- Artist photos are expressionless and have strong contrast
- Many backgrounds are industrial areas/underground/ruins etc.

### ● 5-3. DIY printing texture
- Risograph, silk screen, copy machine roughness
- Low resolution black and white photos

These have had a major influence on modern "Retro Synthwave" design.

## 6. Resurrection: Minimal Wave movement since 2000s

Minimal Wave/Coldwave was largely forgotten in the 90s, but was greatly reevaluated in the 2000s.

### ● 6-1. Minimal Wave Records (NY)

Representative compilation:

### ● 6-2. Internet and rediscovery
- With the spread of Discogs, rare sound sources from the cassette era are being shared.
- Old recordings uploaded to YouTube spread among young people
- Blog culture (e.g. Mutant Sounds) introduces rare sound sources

### ● 6-3. Connecting contemporary artists such as TR/ST / Cold Cave

### ● TR/ST (2010s~)
- A project by Canadian artist Robert Alfons
- Minimal Wave / Coldwave texture + modern electro
