## "Musical characteristics and Japanese sensibilities"

Text: mmr｜Theme: The relationship between Happy Hardcore and Japanese culture

Happy Hardcore emerged from the British rave scene in the early 1990s.
The music, which combines pop and emotional melodies with explosively fast beats of around 170 BPM, took Europe by storm, and then unexpectedly connected with Japanese culture, achieving a unique development.
The affinity between this "happy" sound and "Japanese culture" is not just an import of musical genres, but a new cultural hybrid.

### What is Happy Hardcore?

Derived from British rave/hardcore techno in the early 1990s.

**Characteristics**: High tempo of around 170BPM, pop and melodic synth, anime/cartoon sampling.

As the name suggests, this genre is a combination of "Happy" and "Hardcore".

### Relevance to Japanese culture

#### Affinity with anime/game music

Happy Hardcore emphasizes bright and catchy melodies, so it goes well with the taste of anime songs and game music.

In particular, the use of voice material from bishoujo anime and Famicom/SNES-style chiptunes are popular with overseas producers.

Example: In the Anime Rave/J-Core scene, anime lines and melodies are sampled to make it happy hardcore.

#### Connection with J-Core

Since the 2000s, Japan's unique "J-Core" scene has emerged.

Based on happy hardcore, fused with otaku culture (anime, doujin, Akihabara club culture).

[DJ Sharpnel](https://amzn.to/4pIBKCL) and [m1dy](https://amzn.to/4pCFQfA) are internationally known.

Overseas fans recognize the formula of "Happy Hardcore + Anime" as "Japanese" and support it as a re-import.

#### Dance game culture (BEMANI/DDR)

Many happy hardcore songs are included in Konami's [Dance Dance Revolution (DDR)](https://amzn.to/4mxxAe5) and [beatmania IIDX series](https://amzn.to/46ic1ta).

As a result, game center culture other than clubs in Japan has spread to young people.

For example: DDR songs by [Naoki](https://amzn.to/42BJOuW), [Ryu☆](https://amzn.to/46xoN5F), [DJ Shimamura](https://amzn.to/46OsTHX) and others have a great influence on Happy Hardcore fans overseas.

#### Festivals and doujin sales

Unlike rave in the UK, the scene in Japan is centered around M3 (sound/media mix doujin sales) and Akihabara-style club events.

"Derivative music distribution" and "doujin CD culture" uniquely supported the distribution and development of Happy Hardcore.

### Cultural keywords

- **Kawaii**: Japanese "kawaii culture" is reflected in the fast, pop melody.

- **Otaku culture**: Directly connected to anime, doujinshi, and Akihabara club culture.

### The unique role of Japanese culture in global music history

Happy Hardcore originally came from British rave, but it merged with Japanese culture (anime, games, doujins, music games) to form a unique "J-Core" culture.
Today, it is recognized as being associated with "Happy Hardcore = anime-like cuteness," and Japan has become an important base internationally.
