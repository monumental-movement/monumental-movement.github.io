## Command Records and "sound design"—what was innovative about it?

Text: mmr | Theme: Carefully traces the history, representative works, related artists, anecdotes, and influence of Enoch Wright, who elevated the "demonstration record" of the stereo era to the level of art, and the company he founded, Command Records, to this day.


In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a person among audio enthusiasts who changed their orientation from ""records to be listened to" to ""records to be listened to." Conductor/producer Enoch Light started Command Records, a label pursuing high quality sound, in 1959, and became a symbol of ""hi-fi culture"' with his unique artwork and cutting-edge recording technology. This article summarizes the entire story, including its historical context, representative works, relationship with Tony Mottola, and today"s evaluation.

### "Hi-Fi Lounge/Space Age Pop"

Command Records clearly aimed at the market as an ""audio demonstration record," selecting, arranging, and recording the songs with the highest priority on sound quality. Wright introduced the latest technology such as multi-mic recording and master recording on 35mm film, and practiced production with a strong awareness of the sound field (stereo image). This resulted in a group of albums that emphasized the ""panning effect" and localization of percussion instruments, and established the ""hi-fi lounge/space age pop'' genre, which was different from general pop and jazz.

### Anecdote/Legend/Episode

- **Gatefold and Graphic Aesthetics**

Command's LP covers were visually strong, sometimes featuring a cover by abstract artist Josef Albers. The design of the CD as something that went beyond a mere demo disc to something people would want to own stimulated the collector culture that followed.


- **Promotional slogan: "You"ll be surprised the moment you hear it for the first time"**

Stereo 35/MM"s liner notes and promotions used provocative phrases such as ""You"ll be surprised when you hear it for the first time,'' to arouse listeners' interest. This is an example of successful marketing based on technical confidence.


- **The conflict between commerce and art**

The sound quality, which was close to that of a ""demonstration'' version, was welcomed by audiophiles, but some questioned its universality as a pop song. Despite this, there were some successes on Chart (Stereo 35/MM, etc.), and Wright was one of the few producers who could make "technical appeal" commercially viable.

### Representative series and albums

Persuasive Percussion series (first published in 1959)
A series intended to be a "stereo showpiece" with percussion instruments in the foreground. It gained popularity with its song selection and layout that had a strong impact even among outsiders. The jacket graphics and explanation of the gatefold were also innovative at the time.


Provocative Percussion Series
Sister series of Persuasive. Although the concept is similar, some works have been improved on the arrangement and solo presentation, and have achieved high rankings on the Billboard charts.


Stereo 35/MM (1961)
The album was recorded at Carnegie Hall using a 35mm master. It remained at the top of the charts for a long time after its release, and is a prime example of achieving technical appeal and commercial success at the same time.

The "Roman Guitar" (1960) series is particularly famous, and is a popular work that arranges Latin and Italian folk songs in high-fidelity.

### Current situation and impact

Command Records itself effectively came to an end around 1970, but their works are still in circulation through reissues, high-quality remasters, and reissues for audiophiles. Persuasive/Provocative songs and jackets continue to be cited in the context of "mid-century design" and bachelor pad culture, and are also the subject of sampling and remixing. Its influence on modern listening culture (vintage audio hobbies, virtual room simulations, etc.) is considerable.

### Summary: Legacy of Enoch Light

Enoch Light was a man who not only pursued "good sound" but also designed an object called a record, redefining the "listening experience" in the stereo era. Command Records" works are still being reevaluated today in the context of audio history, design history, and pop culture. Creating the ""surprise'' you feel when you listen to music for the first time is Wright"s true essence, and his works still retain that magical power.

Also, the relationship between Enoch Light and Tony Mottola went beyond just "producer and guitarist". Combining Light"s recording aesthetic with Mottola"s flexible and versatile guitar playing, Command Records became a space-age pop icon that continues to captivate audiophiles around the world.
