## Progressive rock and anime: a grand narrative that intersects

Text: mmr｜Theme: Progressive rock that has a high affinity with anime

When we talk about the relationship between anime and music, genres that are directly connected come to mind, such as J-Pop, idol songs, Eurobeat, and electronica. However, if you dig a little deeper, you will find that it has a surprisingly strong affinity with **progressive rock**. On the surface, it may seem distant from "anime songs," but its long structure, difficult rhythms, and concept album-like storytelling actually resonate in many ways with the characteristics of the anime medium.

### ■ Characteristics of progressive rock and narrative nature of anime
Progressive rock (hereinafter referred to as progressive rock) is known as an ""evolutionary form of rock'' that was born in the 1960s and 1970s. Typical features are as follows.

- **Long composition**: It is not uncommon for one song to last over 10 minutes, and the entire song unfolds like an epic poem.
- **Difficult rhythms and odd time signatures**: A complex rhythm structure that challenges the listener brings intellectual stimulation that is different from the "comfort" of regular pop music.
- **Conceptuality**: In many cases, the entire album tells a single story or theme, often accompanied by a science fiction/fantasy worldview.

These elements naturally overlap with anime's ""long-term storytelling" and ""complex human relationships and worldview construction." Particularly in genres such as science fiction and fantasy, the ""taiga epic'' structure of prog rock can work effectively as a musical device that complements the visual and narrative breadth.

### ■ Comparison between the golden age of progressive rock and Japanese anime

In the 1970s, progressive rock bands such as Pink Floyd and Yes produced albums with themes of ""space," ""time," and ""existence.''

Anime from the same period included ""Space Opera"-like works such as ""Space Battleship Yamato" (https://amzn.to/4pxqmcR) and ""Mobile Suit Gundam'' (https://amzn.to/3IpgXmS).

Although there is little direct contact between the two, it is interesting that they developed in parallel with their ""attitude to write stories from a cosmic perspective.''

### ■ Case study: Evangelion and progressive rock feel
In fact, there are not many examples of progressive rock being directly introduced into anime. However, there are works that have been pointed out to have progressive rock elements. A typical example is **[""Neon Genesis Evangelion''](https://amzn.to/46uRu3i)**.

The soundtrack by Shiro Sagisu is peppered with profound and dissonant developments reminiscent of King Crimson and Yes. In particular, songs such as ""Decisive Battle" and ""Thanatos" make frequent use of odd time signatures and key changes, and instead of giving the listener easy pleasure, they arouse anxiety and tension. This is exactly the expressive method that prog rock is good at, and it resonates with the ""difficulty" and ""philosophy" of the work as a whole.

Additionally, the Western ideas and religious motifs that Eva pays homage to are also elements that frequently appear in progressive rock concept albums. As a result, it can be said that Evangelion embodies a progressive rock worldview not only visually and narratively, but also musically.

### ■ Why didn't progressive rock become mainstream in anime?
However, the mainstream of anime music is J-POP, rock, electro, etc., and there are few examples of progressive rock being pushed to the forefront. One of the reasons for this may be the **difference from commerciality**. Progressive rock songs are often difficult to understand, long, and don"t have catchy hooks. It doesn"t go well with the ""short, impactful hook'' required for openings and endings.

However, on the other hand, there is still room for progressive rock techniques to continue to exist in ""places with a high degree of freedom'' such as soundtracks, OVAs, and movie versions. Considering the rise of post-rock and progressive metal in recent years, the possibilities are even wider.

### ■ What if progressive rock had penetrated anime?
Just imagine that.
- Symphonic progressive rock that supports the fantasy world of Hayao Miyazaki's works.
- King Crimson-like cutting guitar riff that echoes through cyberpunk anime.
- Think of long-term series works as albums, and design music with progressive rock suites for each season.

The affinity between anime and progressive rock is not just a combination of musical genres and visual expressions, but has the potential to extend to the structural design of the entire story.

### ■ Conclusion
Progressive rock never became ""mainstream'' in commercial anime. However, its long composition, difficult rhythm, and conceptual nature have a high affinity with the taiga-like development of anime works centered on science fiction and fantasy.

Examples like Neon Genesis Evangelion, which directly incorporate progressive rock techniques, are just the tip of the iceberg. In the future, the delusion of ""what if anime was told through progressive rock'' will continue to show new intersections between music and video.
