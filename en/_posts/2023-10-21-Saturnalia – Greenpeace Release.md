Saturnalia is the project of UK producers Jim Sullivan and Steve McGarrigle. All profits from this release were donated to Greenpeace.

The piano and vocal on the A side is a sample from Mo Lester's "Blue Sky Day", and the vocal is a sample from African Business's "In Zaire". 
The B-side line is from the movie Star Trek IV: The Long Walk Home.
