Noisia is a Dutch drum and bass trio that disbanded in 2022. He produces a wide range of music including drum'n'bass, house, breaks, and electronic sounds, and in 2014 he also worked on the remix of LOST CHILD, which was included in Momoiro Clover Z's "Furious Space Symphony - 7th Movement 'Infinite Love' (Emperor Style)".

"Yellow Brick / Raar" is a breakout house track released in 2007 by Noisia's own label, Division Recordings.

'Yellow Brick' is an addictive, uplifting track with a familiar noisy bassline and a very soothing and simple beat.

'Raar', on the other hand, is a track that will absolutely destroy the dance floor.

Where "Yellow Brick" was subdued with a simple beat and tempo, "Raar" feels like you're getting hit in the head with a sinister bass and a crazy beat that feels intentionally off.

This is a must-hear record for all noise fans, even if you don't like house music.
