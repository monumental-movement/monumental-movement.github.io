### An ear that transcends genres: David Toop Changes in musical thinking

> "Music shouldn't be confined to genres. If you open your ears, everything becomes music."
> ― David Toop

### 1970s - Between improvisation and avant-garde

Having established himself in London's free improvisation scene, Toop began his career as a critic while performing as a guitarist.
For him, music was not a form or style, but the act of listening itself.
During this period, he had already developed an attitude of transcending genre boundaries.

He explores environmental sounds and traditional music from various regions, and presents the sounds themselves as "works."
Against the backdrop of the world music boom, Toop proposed cross-cultural listening.
Rather than consuming other cultures as "decoration," a methodology has emerged that expands the experience of sound.
He truly viewed music as a ``sound map of the world.''

## 1990s - “Rap Attack” and critique of urban culture

Rap Attack is an innovative book that not only chronicles the dawn of hip-hop, but also connects music, urban culture, and media phenomena.
Around the same time, he discussed ambient and jungle, and was actively involved in cultural criticism of electronic music.
It can be said that this was the era when Toop's style, which combines criticism and a sense of the field, was established.

| 1984–1991 | *Rap Attack* (various editions) | Interpreting Grandmaster Flash and Run-DMC in the context of urban culture.|

### 2000s - Ocean of Sound and sensory liberation

``Ocean of Sound,'' known for its metaphor of ``sea of ​​sound,'' contained insights that anticipated the spread of streaming.
The text, which is a fusion of essays, criticism, and literature, goes beyond the framework of a music book and functions as ``aural literature.''
His own ambient works also presented a world of soft and diffused sounds.

| Year | Featured sound sources/artists | Commentary |
|------|----------------|------|
| 2001 | Brian Eno – *Ambient 1: Music for Airports* (Re-evaluation) | Reconsidering the relationship between the environment and hearing as "drifting sound."|

### Since the 2010s - Sound Art and the Archeology of Memory

In works such as ``Sinister Resonance,'' he explores musings on ``things that cannot be heard'' and ``reverberation.''
He has expanded his activities to the field of fine art and sound art, expanding music criticism into spatial and philosophical practice.
Through themes such as memory, silence, and blank space, he reconsiders the sense of the ear from its roots.

| Year | Featured sound sources/artists | Commentary |
|------|----------------|------|
| 2010 | *Sinister Resonance* | A philosophical exploration of the "invisible shadow of sound."|
| 2016 | *Entities Inertias Faint Beings* | Own work.A tranquil sound world that combines ambient and improvisation.|
| Late 2010s | Sound installation work | A practical project that questions the relationship between music and space.|

### Conclusion - Genreless Practitioners

David Toop's trajectory is a half-century-long exploration of how to listen to music.
Jazz, hip-hop, ambient, sound art - he doesn't fit into any of them, but rather continues to expand the ``possibilities of sound itself'' by transcending these boundaries.
