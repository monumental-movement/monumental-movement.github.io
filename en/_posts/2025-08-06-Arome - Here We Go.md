Frank Zenker, also known as Arome, is a hard trance/tech trance DJ and producer from Germany, better known as Scot Project. The music released under the name Arome has a stronger influence of tech trance and techno than under the name Scot Projec, resulting in a harder and more minimalist hard trance style.

"Here We Go", released in 2000, is Arome's masterpiece and is considered a hard trance classic.
