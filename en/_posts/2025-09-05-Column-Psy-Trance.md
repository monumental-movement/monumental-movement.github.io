### Towards the future of psychedelics
Psy-Trance was born from the intersection of hippie culture and technology, branched out into many different forms after its golden age in the 90s, and continues to dominate festivals around the world.Tracking the evolution of sound design and changes in equipment reveals the dynamism of its sound and the depth of its culture.

We started with analog equipment, went through digitalization, and are now in the stage of fusion that transcends genres.**1990s gore spirituality**, **2000s high-tech full-on explosiveness**, **2010s digital crossover**, and **2020s cross-genre evolution**.Each era created its own aesthetic.

What is common in this flow is "expansion of consciousness" and "joint experience."Although the stage has changed from beach parties to huge festivals to online streaming, the desire for psychedelic experiences remains the same.

In the future, we can expect further developments that will transcend dimensions, such as sound design using AI, psychedelic experiences linked to VR and AR, and live performances that combine Eurorack modular and digital.

**Psy-Trance will continue to be a "cultural and spiritual movement," not just a musical genre.**
Tracing this history is not just a record of sound, but a shared part of humanity's ``journey of consciousness expansion''.
