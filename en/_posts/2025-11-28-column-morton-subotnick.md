# **Prologue: Who is Morton Subotnick**

Text: mmr｜Theme: About the "controllable future" pioneered by electronic music innovators

Morton Subotnick (1933–) is an American contemporary musician and electronic music composer, and is widely known as the person who released the world's first commercial record produced entirely using synthesizers, Silver Apples of the Moon (1967).
This work was released by Nonesuch Records, a label specializing in classical music, and was groundbreaking in that it presented electronic sounds as a "work" in an unprecedented way at the time.

Subotnick"s innovations go beyond simply composing electronic music; he is also important as a key figure in the development of Buchla"s West Coast synthesizer, and has had a long-term influence on modern modular synth culture.

# **1. Early childhood and music education**

Morton Subotnick was born in Los Angeles in 1933.
He received an advanced musical education, learning to play the clarinet from an early age and already performing in a local orchestra as a teenager.
He later joined the military, and through his performance experience there, he strengthened his professional attitude towards music.

After his retirement, Subotnick developed an interest in "new forms of expression" through collaborations with the Los Angeles Music Center and dancers, and from the late 1950s he turned toward avant-garde music.

---

# **2. 1950–60s: The San Francisco Tape Music Center and the birth of electronic music**

A turning point for Subotnick came when he founded the company with Pauline Oliveros, Ramon Sender, and others.
**San Francisco Tape Music Center (1962)**.

This facility was a fundamental research center for electronic music on the American West Coast, and was constantly experimenting with live performance, tape music, and media art.

### ● Tape music and improvisation

At the time, Subotnick was exploring the structuring and "playability" of electronic sounds, making full use of musique concrète and tape editing techniques.

### ● Meeting with Don Buchla

The friends at Tape Music Center recognized the need for a new musical instrument to make electronic acoustics more playable, and asked engineer Don Buchla to develop one.
The result of this collaboration was the **Buchla Series 100**, which became the origin of what would later become "West Coast Synthesis."

# **3. Birth of West Coast Synthesis: Thoughts of Buchla and Subotnick**

The biggest innovation that resulted from Subotnick and Buchla's collaboration was a direction for electronic musical instruments that took a different approach than the East Coast Moog systems.

## ● The idea of ​​"throw away the keyboard"

Subotnick was looking for a ""sound sculpture'' using control signals that departed from traditional scales and harmony.
In response, Buchla didn't include a keyboard, but included a touch controller and a random voltage source.

## ● Superior tone and control

The idea that modulation and complex controls determine musical structure remains intact in modern modular synth culture.

# **4. "Silver Apples of the Moon" (1967): A work that changed the history of electronic music**

### Features of the work

* The entire story consists of only electronic sounds by Buchla 100
* Structure that includes rhythmic elements, which was unusual at the time.
*One of the first pieces of electronic music released by a commercial label
* Composition styles that can be connected to performing arts and multimedia

This work was not only highly acclaimed as a work of art, but it was also one of the earliest examples of electronic music being established as a ""commodity to be appreciated.''

---

# **5. 1970s: Live electronics and educational activities**

Since the 1970s, Subotnick has focused on live performances that manipulate electronic sounds in real time.
In particular, a unique system called ""Ghost Electronics"' processes the performer"s sound externally and adds complex modulation.

### ● Basic idea of ​​Ghost Electronics system

* Performer's sound → send to external processor
* Modulated by feedback or control voltage
* Live music and electronic processing become an inseparable unified expression

This system was used in many productions and played an important role in connecting classical performers with electronic music.

---

# **6. Application to media art and music education software for children**

Since the 1980s, Subotnick has been interested in the relationship between acoustics and interfaces, and has worked on creating interactive musical teaching materials using computers.
His representative projects include the ""Making Music'' series (1980s).
This is software that allows children to learn about sounds and structures while operating it, and was widely used in American educational settings.

---

# **7. Post-90s: The long-term influence of electronic music and the resurgence of modular culture**

In the 21st century, as modular synths are being reevaluated, Subotnick's work and ideas have once again attracted attention.
In particular, with the spread of West Coast modular products (complex oscillators, function generators, random voltages, etc.), there was a growing movement to position Subotnick as the "father."

---

# **8. Major works and feature analysis**

The following is a summary of Subotnick's major works from a structural perspective.

## ● Silver Apples of the Moon (1967)

* Works for Buchla 100
* Rhythmic structure with voltage control
* Features a layered structure of electronic sounds

## ● The Wild Bull (1968)

* Built only with electronic sounds
* A work that explores the balance between operability and acoustic structure

## ● Sidewinder (1971)

* Focus on live processing
* Focus on sustaining and transforming electronic sounds

## ● Until Spring (1975)

* An electronic sound piece that structures the changes of the seasons.
* Created based on operation records of Buchla system

# **10. Subotnick's philosophy: What is "performance" in electronic music?**

The core concepts that Morton Subotnick has consistently pursued are:

1. **Electronic sound is not just a material, it can become the structure itself**
2. **Control voltage is the "handwriting" of composition**
3. **The boundary between performance and composition does not exist in electronic music**
4. **Interfaces define the conditions for creativity**

Subotnick"s ideas are the basis for design ideas that are commonplace in today"s Eurorack modular culture (complex oscillators, randoms, wavefolders, etc.).

# **Conclusion: What legacy did Subotnick's accomplishments leave?**

Morton Subotnick's achievement lies in reinventing the very framework of electronic music.
He elevated electronic sound from ""timbre manipulation" to ""structural generation," and the system he created with Buchla is the foundation of today's modular synth culture.

"Electronic music can be the future of classical music"
Although Subotnick did not utter these words himself, the trajectory of his work shows just that.

When talking about the history of electronic music, Morton Subotnick's name always comes up at the beginning.
And even now, more than half a century later, its influence has not diminished, but rather continues to grow.
