## Giant of African Music - Who is Fela Kuti?

Text: mmr｜Theme: The life and music of Fela Kuti


Fela Aníkúlápó Kútì (1938–1997) was a Nigerian musician, activist, and founder of Afrobeat. Their unique sound, which blends jazz, funk, highlife, and Yoruba music, had an immense influence on world music in the second half of the 20th century.
His music was not just entertainment, but a political statement denouncing military rule and injustice, and a symbol of resistance despite numerous arrests and violence.

### Life and musical evolution

Fela Aníkúlápó Kútì was born in Abeokuta in 1938 and received his musical education in London before returning to Nigeria in the late 1960s and creating his own musical language, combining blues/jazz/funk/highlife with traditional rhythms. It became more political during the Koola Lobitos period in the 1960s and Africa '70 in the 1970s, and later developed into formations such as Egypt 80.

Fela's music is characterized by long (10 to 30 minute) repetitive grooves, strong horn sections, polyrhythms, and direct messages in pidgin English. Drummer Tony Allen was an integral part of the formation of Afrobeats, and his drumming laid the foundation for the genre.

### Political and cultural activities

Fela declared his mansion the ""Kalakuta Republic"' and operated it as a community, studio, and theatrical space. There have been repeated harsh criticisms of the military government, and there are many incidents of attacks, detentions, and torture by the police and military (one famous incident is the "Expensive Shit" anecdote). While these combative stances have made him Nigeria"s "voice of the voiceless," they have also come at a physical cost.

### Anecdote/Legend

**"Expensive Shit" Incident**: Fela took advantage of the incident in which the police allegedly planted a marijuana joint as a pretext for arrest and turned it into a song (album ""Expensive Shit"'). This story is passed down as an anecdote that symbolizes Fela"s anti-establishment image.

**Kalakuta Attack and Mother"s Death**: The incident in which Fela"s mother was allegedly injured when Kalakuta was attacked by the military became the driving force behind her later songs and activities.
