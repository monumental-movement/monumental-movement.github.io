## History and present of trip hop (abstract hip hop)

Originating in Bristol, England in the 1990s, **Trip-Hop** is a unique musical style that is based on hip-hop rhythms and combines downtempo, dub, jazz, ambient, and more.
Led by artists such as Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky, its cinematic, melancholy sound was sometimes referred to as "abstract hip-hop."

Trip hop is more than just a music genre, it has spread to the world of **soundtrack production**, fashion, and contemporary art, and it has new possibilities in the age of AI music generation.

### Soundtrack production × AI music generation

The cinematic feel of trip hop is perfect for creating soundtracks. In recent years, AI music generation tools have become capable of reproducing the "dark floating feeling" of trip-hop style in a short amount of time. For filmmakers, collaboration between AI and humans is opening up new creative possibilities.
