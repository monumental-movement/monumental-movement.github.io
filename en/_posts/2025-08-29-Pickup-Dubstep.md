### Distance – Night Vision Traffic (Remixes)
<a href="https://jp.mercari.com/item/m41976267806?afid=6142608987"><img src="../assets/images/Distance%20%E2%80%93%20Night%20Vision%20Traffic%20(Remixes).webp"></a>


Features: The combination of Distance, Skream, who have been leading the dubstep scene since its birth, and Goth-Trad, representing Japan, is a dream collaboration.


Charm: Skream is a "destructive beat" that makes use of the essence of the original song, while Goth-Trad is a dark and texture-oriented reconstruction, which can be said to be completely opposite sound images contained in one album. This item has great value as a classic and is in high demand from analog enthusiasts and DJs.

#### Tracklist
```md
A. Night Vision (Skream's 'So Nasty' Version)

B. Traffic (Goth-Trad Remix)

### Aquasky – Nylon Roadster Cosmic Glue
<a href="https://jp.mercari.com/item/m84434801659?afid=6142608987"><img src="../assets/images/Aquasky%20%E2%80%93%20Nylon%20Roadster%20Cosmic%20Glue.webp"></a>


Characteristics: Released on the Moving Shadow label in 1996-97, this album breaks away from an overly jazzy sound and offers a "smooth" breakbeat featuring a gentle and emotional piano section. It feels soothing, like a lullaby, and you can also feel the texture of the heavy bass, which is similar to Dubstep.


Appeal: For those who like the dark and deep bass lines and beats of dubstep, this is a great album to listen to.
