## Miraculous encounter "Eurobeat x Parapara"

Text: mmr｜Theme: Synchronicity of dance and music

At the heart of gyaru culture in Japan in the 1990s was a hand-waving dance called "parapara." The music genre that has spread like one and the same is ""Eurobeat''.

Why did Eurobeat, which was born in Europe and evolved in its own way in Asia, become deeply connected to the Parapara style in Japan?
There was a mix of factors such as not only musical characteristics but also club culture, media strategy, and consumer psychology.

### What is Eurobeat? ─ Evolution of Italo Disco
Eurobeat has its roots in "Italo Disco", which was born in Italy in the 1980s. Adding elements of high energy (Hi-NRG), the tempo changes to a catchy, synth-driven sound.

● Main musical characteristics

- **BPM**: 140-160 and very fast

- **Structure**: Clear chorus, frequent use of refrains

- **Rhythm**: 4/4 drum + handclap

- **Melody**: Bright, dramatic, and melancholy

This structure was a perfect match for the parapara dance, which repeats the same pattern.

### What is Parapara? ──Pleasure of uniform repetition
● Origin of Parapara

- Occurred in the late 1980s at discos in Roppongi and Shibuya, Tokyo (Maharaja, Juliana Tokyo, etc.)

- Group dance with finely aligned hand movements up, down, left and right

- **Movement emphasizes "unity" rather than individuality**: Closer to "team" than social dance

● Why did it match the euro?

- Fast tempo → Easy to synchronize hand gestures and rhythm

- Clear A melody/chorus structure → Easy to create dance "choreography"

- Dramatic song development → matches the climax of the swing

### Avex's strategy: Eurobeat = Japan-only format

● Birth of the "SUPER EUROBEAT" series (1990-)

- Compilation series produced in Italy, exclusively for the Japanese market

- "Linked products" that connect ParaPara Floor and CD shops

- Choreography explanations will be published on jackets and booklets.

● Signed with a dedicated Eurobeat label

Italian labels such as Time, A-Beat C, and Delta have signed exclusive contracts with avex to produce music specifically for the Japanese market.

In this way, Japan's unique ""Eurobeat market'' was formed and gradually became integrated.

### Gyaru culture and charisma: Consumed dance
● To "ParaPara = symbol of gal culture"

- Closely linked to Shibuya 109 fashion

- Distribution of choreography videos (VHS, later DVD)

- Series such as ""Parapara Paradise'' and ""Parapara Kyonen'' are also available.

● Media production

- "Gal charisma" introduces choreography on TV programs and magazines

- Effectively Eurobeat becomes mainstream as a teen trend

- "Remembering = a ritual of participation" and creating a culture of peer pressure and unity

### Revival of ParaPara and internet culture
● After the mid-2000s: End of the boom and underground

- Changes in gyaru culture, transition to mobile phones and the internet

- "Revival events" continue at some clubs

● "Wake-up" of the YouTube generation

- A second parapara boom occurs locally as past choreography videos and songs are shared online.

- There are also phenomena where overseas fans rediscover and receive praise as if they were reimported.

<hr>

### Euro and Parapara were complicit
Eurobeat and Parapara are not just a combination of music and dance.
**They were strongly linked by common cultural codes such as ""repetitiveness,'' ""clear structure,'' ""collectiveness,'' and ""dramatic presentation.''**

It was a perfect example of the phenomenon of ""music becoming culture through the body.''
