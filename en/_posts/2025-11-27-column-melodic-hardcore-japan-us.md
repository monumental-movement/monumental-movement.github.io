## 1. Introduction: What is Melocore?

Text: mmr｜Theme: About Japanese and American melocore, which is supported worldwide for its "heat" and "importance of melody"


Melodic hardcore is a subgenre of hardcore punk that developed in the United States in the late 1980s.
It combines the fast, aggressive rhythms of hardcore with catchy melodies and incorporates pop-punk elements.

Features:
- Songs are short and complete in about 2 to 3 minutes
- Guitar and bass with a melody line in mind
- Lyrics with social, political and personal themes
- Emphasis on DIY spirit and live house culture

This genre influenced not only America but also Japan and Europe, and began to develop in its own way.
