title: Harmonic 33 –Music For Film, Television & Radio Volume One
---


Released in 2005, this album is a classic among Warp releases.

From the swinging, outer-space groove of "Optigan" to the spinning amusement park atmosphere of "Carousel," Harmonic 33 packs as much mood as possible into a short space of time.

Easy listening flows smoothly, like "Bossa Nova Supernova" and "Departure Lounge."

On the other hand, if you're looking for outright eccentricity, listen to "Funky Duck."

If you like spy dramas, we have ""Paranoia" and ""Long Shadow."

Even in short songs like "Marionette," the album still makes its presence felt, and the album ends with the thoughtful and melancholic "Planet 54."
