## What is Northern Soul?

Text: mmr｜Theme: How Northern Soul, which was born in England in the 1960s, spread to Japan and gained unique acceptance and support, about the history, culture, and local scene.


The term Northern Soul is both a musical genre and a concept that refers to specific cultural attitudes and practices. It is a music culture that was enthusiastically supported in the club scene of northern England, mainly focusing on up-tempo soul music produced in America in the mid-to-late 1960s, especially songs on minor labels that did not achieve commercial success.

Its characteristics are clear. The BPM is fast, the 4-time signature is emphasized, a horn section and a dynamic bass line are included, and the song is designed to give top priority to the uplifting feeling on the dance floor. Many of the lyrics are about love or heartbreak, but the emphasis was on rhythms and grooves that evoke physical reactions rather than social messages.

It is important to note that Northern Soul did not begin as "nostalgic music." For young people in the north of England at the time, this was not music of the past, but floor music that was constantly being updated.

>Before Northern Soul was a music genre, it was formed as a collection of specific listening attitudes and dance culture.

## Background of birth: Northern England in the 1960s

The background to the birth of Northern Soul was the regional disparities that plagued British society in the 1960s and the transformation of youth culture. In the south, centered on London, mod, psychedelic, and later rock culture became visible, while in the industrial metropolitan areas of the north, there was a different kind of interest in black American music.

In cities such as Manchester, Wigan, Blackpool and Sheffield, a culture of working-class young people flocking to clubs on weekend nights and dancing for long hours took root. There, songs that no one knew but were overwhelmingly danceable were more valuable than the latest hits.

What is important in this context is the physical and psychological distance between northern England and America. Soul music, which originated in the American South and Detroit, resonated more strongly with the sensibilities of young people in the North than in London. This is because themes such as labor, oppression, and solidarity were shared as daily sensibilities.

> Northern Soul was born spontaneously at the intersection of the social structure of northern England and the physical culture of young people.

## Relationship with American Soul


The musical foundation of Northern Soul lies in soul music produced in America. However, many of these were singles released by small labels in local cities, rather than major label releases like Motown.

A British club DJ unearths works by unknown artists recorded in Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and even southern regions such as Alabama and Texas. Although these songs never charted in the United States, they had the power to set dance floors ablaze in northern England.

DJs went directly to the United States to make purchases, scouring inventory hidden in the backs of warehouses, radio stations, and record stores. As a result, the rarity of records in which no one else had them became valuable, and a "one-of-a-kind culture" unique to Northern Soul was formed.

> Northern Soul was a cross-border culture that was established through the rediscovery and reappraisal of black American music.

## Club culture and the role of the DJ


In Northern Soul, DJs were not just music selectors, but cultural curators. Song selection was extremely strategic and competitive, as the records owned by a particular DJ were directly linked to the club's reputation.

Typical clubs include Manchester's Twisted Wheel and the later iconic Wigan Casino. All-night events were common at these clubs, with dancers dancing for hours on end.

The DJ constructed his set by reading not only the BPM and key, but also the level of fatigue and excitement on the floor. The rarity of the record was important, but even more important was whether it could be danced to.

> In the Northern Soul scene, DJs' song selection decisions themselves determined the evolution of the culture.

## Characteristics of dance and fashion


Northern soul developed not only with music, but also with its own dance style and fashion. The dance is acrobatic, making frequent use of spins, kicks, and jumps, and is characterized by steps that glide across the floor.

To enable this physical expression, emphasis was placed on functionality in clothing. Tight jeans, loose tops, and shoes with slippery soles became the norm, and a culture of expressing individuality with patches and badges took root.

What is important is that these styles were not trends handed down from above, but were born out of practice on the dance floor.

> The physical culture of Northern Soul was formed as a result of adaptation to music and space.

## Change and persistence since the 1970s


In the 1970s, new dance music such as disco, funk, and later house emerged, and the heyday of northern soul came to an end. However, the culture itself did not disappear.

Even after clubs close and the scene shrinks, Northern Soul continues to be preserved and passed on through collector culture, reissues, and retrospective events. Since the 1980s, there has been a growing movement to reevaluate it, and it has become known to younger generations through films and documentaries.

> Northern Soul is not a passing fad, but has survived as a culture that is continually reinterpreted.

## Spread to Japan: records and information


Northern soul was introduced to Japan from the late 1970s to the 1980s. The main channels were imported records, music magazines, and personal networks among DJs.

Japanese soul-funk enthusiasts and DJs adopted Northern Soul as part of their collection, drawing on British club culture. At first, they were only known to those in the know, but their desire for rare records combined with their interest in dance culture gradually expanded their support base.

> The reception of Northern Soul in Japan was supported by fragmented information and an inquisitive spirit.

---

## Japan's unique acceptance and club scene


In Japan, Northern Soul was not reproduced in the same form as in Britain. Rather than an exclusive all-night club, it developed into a community centered around DJ events, bars, and record shops.

It tends to emphasize the sound quality of records, the rarity of records, and the commitment to original records rather than dance, and is characterized by its strong connection to collector culture. On the other hand, the essence of music that can be danced to is maintained, and dance-oriented events continue to be held.

>Japan's Northern Soul has established itself by uniquely adjusting the balance between appreciation and physicality.

## Conclusion: Northern Soul's legacy


Northern soul is a culture that was founded on a different axis from the hit charts and media-driven music history. The practice of digging up unknown music, reacting to it with your body, and sharing it with your friends is also relevant to modern DJ culture and club culture.

Although its popularity in Japan is by no means mass, its persistence and depth prove that Northern Soul is not just a genre, but an attitude.

> Northern Soul continues to raise questions about how we listen to music, how we embody it, and how we share it.
