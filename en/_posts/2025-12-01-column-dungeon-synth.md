## Dungeon Synth ─ An underground ambient aesthetic that diverges from black metal

Text: mmr｜Theme: About the history, production techniques, and cultural position of Dungeon Synth, an underground ambient genre derived from black metal

Dungeon Synth is a music genre that expresses the spirituality of black metal and fantasy/medieval worldview through minimalist synth sounds.
Its origins can be traced back to the European extreme music scene of the early 1990s, but the second and third generations have rapidly expanded since the late 2010s with the expansion of Bandcamp culture, and it has now developed into a gigantic DIY network.

## ■ 1. Definition and characteristics

Dungeon Synth has the following features.

- **Spirituality derived from black metal**
- Harsh climate, loneliness, romanticism, melancholy
- **Fantasy/Medieval Worldview**
- Visual and narrative images of dungeons, castle walls, forests, magic, mythology, etc.
- **Minimalistic synth sound**
- Lo-fi, tape texture, cheap PCM sound source, early music style melody
- **DIY principle**
- Personal production/individual release/Bandcamp focus
- **Emphasis on "presentation of scenery" rather than performance**

As a result, the music is often described as "a soundtrack without a movie," "ambient music for a tabletop RPG," or "a keyboard echoing in a lonely castle."

## ■ 2. History ─ From the earliest times to the present day

Below, we will summarize the important trends from the birth of the genre to the present.

### ● 2-1. Early period (1991–1994)
In the early 1990s, on the fringes of Scandinavian black metal, artists began creating ""dark keyboard-based ambient'' that reduced the number of sounds to the bare minimum.

Of particular importance are:
- **Mortiis (Norway)**
Former member of Emperor. Established a medieval fantasy "Dark Dungeon Music" style.
- **Burzum (Norway) early keyboard pieces**
The final song of ""Hvis Lyset Tar Oss" and the ambient tracks from ""Filosofem" left a strong symbolism for later Dungeon Synth.

Although these are sound sources that predated "Dungeon Synth as a genre name," they are clearly treated as the source by later generations.

### ● 2-2. First wave (1995–2000)
From 1995 to 2000, a young European project that preceded Mortiis "Era I", Cernunnos Woods, Depressive Silence, and Old Tower released works distributed mainly on tape.
At this time, the genre name had not yet been established, but expressions such as "Dungeon Music" were already being used in overseas zines.

### ● 2-3. Blank ~ Re-evaluation (2001–2010)
Falling outside the mainstream of the metal scene, the genre remained within a small community until the mid-2000s.
However, in the late 2000s, as early black metal was reevaluated, **Mortiis Era I was reissued** and began to receive renewed attention worldwide.

### ● 2-4. Second wave (2010–2015)
Changes in the internet environment and the spread of Bandcamp became the deciding factor.

- **Rise of Bandcamp (early 2010s)**
- **The name "Dungeon Synth" has become established on Reddit/Forum**
- **Reactivation of label activities such as Dark Age Productions**

During this period, in parallel with Atmospheric Black Metal, quieter, more immersive works increased overseas, forming a cohesive subculture.

### ● 2-5. Third wave (2016–2023)
The most important period when the genre grew rapidly.

- **Old Tower (Netherlands)**
With its majestic, layered style, it plays a central role in modern Dungeon Synth.
- **Thangorodrim (Portugal)**
Re-presenting the early lo-fi feel and classic fantasy worldview.
- **Fief (USA)**
Expanding their fan base by presenting a bright and melodic side.

Around this time, a large number of mix videos were uploaded to YouTube, and Twitch streamers used them as background music, dramatically expanding awareness.

### ● 2-6. Modern day (2024–)
The following characteristics can be seen in the second half of the 2020s.

- Subdivision within genres (Forest Synth, Winter Synth, Heroic Synth, etc.)
- Re-expansion of cassette culture
- Increased participation from Asia (Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, etc.)

# ■ 4. Sound Design: Dungeon Synth production techniques

Dungeon Synth is ""a genre that sublimates the limitations of equipment as an aesthetic.''
Below, we will summarize the sound sources, MIDI operation, and effect methods used in the actual production.

---

## ● 4-1. Sound source used (synth plug-in)

### ■ Classic PCM sound source
Many artists sought the feel of game consoles and PCM keyboards from the 90s.

- **Roland JV/XP series (actual or sampling)**
- **Yamaha PSR series** (cheap home keyboard)
- **Korg Triton / M1 sample sound source**
- **General MIDI tone (GM sound source)**

GM pianos, Choir Aahs, Strings, Pads, etc. Cheapness and nostalgia are treated as values.

### ■ Soft synth
In modern times, the following are often used:

- **DSK free VST**
- DSK ChoirZ, DSK Strings, etc.
- **Kontakt library (period instruments/pads)**
- **Free synths such as Helm and Surge**

In order to maintain a lo-fi quality, samples with low bitrates are often intentionally used.

---

## ● 4-2. MIDI arrangement techniques

Dungeon Synth emphasizes **repetition, a small number of motives, and long pads** over complex performances.

### ▼ Characteristics of harmony
- Natural minor scale
- Darker modes such as Dorian and Phrygian
- Perfect fifths (power chord style) are often used
- Prefer **octave stack** over triads

### ▼ Melody movement
- Focus on **diatone/simple melodies** rather than chromatic scales
- Slow tempo (40-70 BPM)

### ▼ Treatment of rhythm
Dungeon Synth is often **rhythmless (drumless)**.
Even if there were, the only sounds were small toms, percussion, and light timpani.

---

## ● 4-3. How to create a lo-fi texture

An important technique to create the "underground" feel of Dungeon Synth.

### ■ Bit Reduction (Bit Crusher)
Adding a roughness of about 8 to 12 bits will enhance the 90's feel.

### ■ Tape simulation
- Saturation (light distortion)
- Wow & Flutter
- Noise (tape hiss)

Many artists actually record their songs onto cassettes.

### ■ EQ processing
- **Remove low (below 100Hz)** → Towards monaural/old equipment feel
- **Remove high frequencies (above 6-8kHz)** → Remove digital odor

### ■ Reverb
The most important effect that creates a Dungeon Synth-like feel.

Specifically used are:

- Hall (feeling like a medieval hall)
- Plate (old-fashioned metallic reverberation)
- Fewer Early Reflections/Longer Decay

### ■ Stereo width
- The pad is wide
- Melody line is in the center
- Bass is completely monaural

# ■ 6. Aesthetics of Dungeon Synth: Worldview and Visual Design

Dungeon Synth places more emphasis on "world building" than music.

## ● 6-1. Typical image
- Stone underground corridor
- Old castle hall
- torchlight
- Snowy Forest
- Fantasy RPG-like map

Contemporary artists use a variety of expressions such as hand-drawn illustrations, pixel art, AI generation, and photo processing.

## ● 6-2. Jacket culture
- Small scale art for cassettes
- Vertical image intended for Bandcamp jacket
- Slightly smeared font

Visual influence is extremely large and plays a role in complementing the worldview of the work.

---

# ■ 8. Dungeon Synth production process (practical guide)

Below is a plan for actually creating a song.

## ● Step 1: Preparing the keyboard
- A MIDI keyboard with 25 to 49 keys is sufficient
- OK with low-cost software sound source

## ● Step 2: Creating a pad (Drone)
- Extend the minor chord
- Soften with low-pass filter
- Shake it a little with tape simulation

## ● Step 3: Melody
- Repeating simple motifs
- Create a "story-like" development without changing the harmony too much

## ● Step 4: Grace notes
- Thin layering of bells, wind, footsteps, and environmental sounds
- Reinforce harmony with Choir and Strings

## ● Step 5: Reverb
- Hall + long decay (about 4-8 seconds)
- Increase damping to make it darker

## ● Step 6: Mastering
- Tape feel/lo-fi processing
- Light limiter (no need for excessive compression depending on the genre)

# ■ 9. Cultural significance of Dungeon Synth

Dungeon Synth is a rare type of music that combines the intense worldview of black metal with the tranquility of ambient music, and is a culture that aspires to "building an inner world."

- Individual creators spin their own stories without relying on large-scale scenes
- Strongly tied to the aesthetics of fantasy literature, TRPGs, and game music
- Despite being on the periphery of extreme music, exchanges are thriving internationally.

It has even been called "Bandcamp's strongest DIY genre" since the 2020s, and it will continue to quietly expand.

# ■ 10. Summary

Dungeon Synth
**・Black metal spirituality
・Fantasy narrative
・The DIY nature of lo-fi synth music**
It is a unique cultural area that was established through the combination of these three elements.

Although the acoustics are simple, the intentional constraints create a strong aesthetic that continues to inspire creators around the world to create work.
