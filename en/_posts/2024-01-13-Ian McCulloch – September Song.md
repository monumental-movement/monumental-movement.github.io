Ian McCulloch is a singer and guitarist (born May 5, 1959) known for his emotional image and is primarily known as the vocalist of Echo And The Bunnymen.

His career also includes time in The Crucial Three with Pete Wylie and Julian Cope in the 1970s, and in the Bunnymen offshoot Electrafixion in the '90s.

McCulloch cites Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, The Doors, Leonard Cohen, and especially David Bowie as his musical influences.

He describes Cohen's 1968 song "Susan" as "a song with perfect lyrics and a perfect melody", and Bowie as "the greatest solo artist of the 20th century who had a huge influence".
