The Brothers Johnson is an American soul/funk/jazz/disco band. Formed in Los Angeles, California in 1975, the group is led by brothers George and Louis Johnson. Early members included his cousin Alex Ware.

The two began their careers as backing musicians for the likes of Bobby Womack and Billy Preston, before being discovered by producer Quincy Jones.

Quincy Jones brought them to attention when he used them on his 1975 album Mellow Madness.

He recorded eight albums between 1976 and 1988, and is best known for the disco hit "Stomp!" (1980) and the Shuggy Otis classic "Strawberry Letter #23" (1977 cover).
