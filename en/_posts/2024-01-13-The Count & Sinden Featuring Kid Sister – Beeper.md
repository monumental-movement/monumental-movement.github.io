Sinden & Count Of Monte Cristal is the duo of Graeme Sinden and Joshua Harvey.

"Beeper," featuring Chicago-based American rapper and singer Melissa Lauren aka Kid Sister, is a track that incorporates the UK speed garage style of the late 90s.

“Beeper” is a track that stands out for its free-spiritedness in electronic music, and it also feels like a throwback to the speed garage of the late 90s.

It may be one of the short-lived mutations of UK garage, but it still has a strong influence.
