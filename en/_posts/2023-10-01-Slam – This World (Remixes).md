The Wighnomy Brothers remix is great, the original being typical British synthetic music with slightly trance-y pop/house vocals, sonically transformed enough, filtered and subtly altered to become a very sharp and emotive stadium micro-house anthem for the 22nd century.

Wighnomy Bros has accomplished this highly unthinkable. Created hip and thrilling stadium music.

Slam are a Scottish DJ-producer duo (Orde Meikle, Stuart McMillan) from Glasgow.

Co-founder of Soma Quality Recordings and promoter of the Atlantis parties (1989-1992) and Slam parties (1991-) in Glasgow.

We met in Sheffield in 1986. At the time, Ord was studying geography at university and Stuart was working in a bar.

The group is named after Phuture's legendary track.
