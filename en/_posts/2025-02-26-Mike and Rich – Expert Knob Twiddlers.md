title: Mike & Rich – Expert Knob Twiddlers
---


Mike & Rich's "Expert Knob Twiddlers" (1996) is a collaborative album by Richard D. James, aka Aphex Twin, and Mike Paradinas, aka µ-Ziq, two geniuses who led the electronic music scene in the 90s.

The song was created over a few days during the 1994 World Cup and is said to have been born out of a drunken jam session. This background creates a light and free-spirited atmosphere in the music.

Described by Paradinas as "an updated version of easy listening and funk," melodies reminiscent of 70s lounge music and elevator music are fused with distorted beats and the whimsical tones of analog synths.

These tracks are the result of a fusion of Aphex Twin"s unpredictable experimentalism and µ-Ziq"s melodic structure, creating a sonic adventure that goes beyond mere "written music".
