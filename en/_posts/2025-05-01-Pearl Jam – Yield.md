Pearl Jam is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1990. They are known as a major band of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, along with Soundgarden and Nirvana, and are said to be "the most popular American rock and roll band of the 90s."

Pearl Jam"s fifth studio album, ""Yield,'' released in 1998, feels like a return to the straightforward rock sound of the band"s early days. Brendan O'Brien is participating as a producer.
