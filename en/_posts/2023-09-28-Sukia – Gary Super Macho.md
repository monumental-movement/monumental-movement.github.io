This is a trip hop song released by Mo Wax in 1997.

Sukia is an American electronic music band based in Camarillo, California, USA, featuring former child actor Ross Harris, who appeared in shows such as CHiPS and Little House in the 1970s.

Formed in the early 1990s within Los Angeles' expanding indie music scene, they took their name from the Italian vampire comic book of the same name.
