Paprika Soul is a project started in 1991 by Alan Barnes (Jazzdubossa) and Andy Spiller.

"He Loves You" was Paprika Soul's first release, and the EDM producer involved in this release, Andrew Hughes, was a member of Paprika Soul at the time.

It was released by Baseline Records, a UK label that specialized in re-releasing rare funk and soul records in the late '80s and early '90s.
