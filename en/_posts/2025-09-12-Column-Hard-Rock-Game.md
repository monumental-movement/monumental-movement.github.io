## Considering the relationship between major hard rock records and gaming culture


Text: mmr｜Theme: Relationship between hard rock and gaming culture


Hard rock was born from blues rock and psychedelic rock in the late 1960s and exploded in popularity in the 1970s. On the other hand, video game culture began to emerge in the late 1970s and became established as popular culture in the 1980s. Although both have developed independently, they have shared the impact of sound, visual aesthetics, and youth culture, creating unexpected intersections in each era. Here, we will organize the relationships by era and look back at the connections between representative masterpieces and gaming culture.
