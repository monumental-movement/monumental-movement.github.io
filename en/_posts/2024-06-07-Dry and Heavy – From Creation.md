---


Dry&Heavy is a Japanese reggae dub band formed in 1991 by drummer Shigeki Nanao (Dry) and bassist Takeshi Akimoto (Heavy).
Dry&Heavy's sound is influenced by 1970s Jamaican dub sounds such as King Tubby and Lee Perry, and they have been successful at reggae and dub festivals both domestically and internationally.

In 1995, Rikuru Mai and Ao Inoue joined. During Fuji Rock in 2001, Takeshi Akimoto left the group and Audio Active's bassist Pata joined. In 2011, they started their activities again as an original rhythm team consisting of Nanao and Akimoto.

"From Creation" is the fifth album released by the Japanese electronic label Beat Records in 2002.
