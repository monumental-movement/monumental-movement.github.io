## Memories of art and themes carved in the desert

Text: mmr｜Theme: To know the history of Burning Man is to understand that it is more than just a festival, it is a "future city and human experiment"

Burning Man is more than just a festival, it"s a testing ground for collaboratively creating a Black Rock City. It began on the beaches of the San Francisco Bay Area in 1986, and since the 1990s has been held annually in Nevada"s Black Rock Desert. It"s a place where art, fire, technology, and a culture of gifting intersect, intersecting deeply with the Bay Area"s corporate and startup culture.

### Origin and development: from the beach to the desert

Burning Man began in 1986 when Larry Harvey and Jerry James burned a wooden effigy (The Man) at Baker Beach in San Francisco. From there, the number of participants increased, and after moving to the Black Rock Desert for the first time in 1990, the event transformed into a temporary city-building project in the desert.

#### 2004 "10 Principles" and their impact

As the organization evolved, the ""10 Principles" (Radical Inclusion, Gifting, Decommodification, etc.) proposed by Larry Harvey in 2004 organized the community's values ​​and provided a cultural framework for the event. This is the ""ideological core" of Burning Man and has spread to regional burns around the world.

---


### Relationship with Bay Area/Tech

Burning Man has a long relationship with Silicon Valley. In the late 1990s, research points out that Burning Man has been used as a cultural infrastructure by the Bay Area"s creative industries, with anecdotes of participation by Google"s founders. The Stanford et al. study argues that Burning Man became the cultural foundation for a "new media industry."

---


### Participation and controversy of famous people/celebrities

Burning Man has long been a magnet for celebrities — entrepreneurs, artists, and even politicians (names like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos have been mentioned in the media). This can create friction between the principle of "decommodification" and the actual behavior of participants with wealth and influence.

---


### Anecdote/Legend

When it was relocated in 1990, a police ban on burning on beaches was a turning point, and the decision was made to move to the desert.
Burning Man

An interesting story that the roots of "Google Doodle" are related to the founder's vacation announcement at Burning Man (the intersection of corporate culture and festivals).

Since the 2000s, giant "mutant vehicles" and sculptures made of fire have attracted attention and been featured in media around the world.

While Burning Man remains a hub of creativity, it faces commercialization, safety and environmental concerns, and the question, "Who is Burning for?" The community is stepping up sustainability efforts (Leave No Trace, art grants) and sharing knowledge in regional networks.

#### 1995: Inferno

Inferno in 1995 was an important year in that it spread the awareness among participants that ""Burning Man is not just an outdoor festival, but a place for ritual burning and spiritual rebirth.''

From around this time, participatory experiences that combined fire and art became the norm, forming the basis of modern Burning Man art culture.

### Notes and supplementary explanations

The above list was constructed by referring to the theme descriptions from Burning Man's official annual archive, as well as multiple fan and record sites.

The Temple (a place of prayer) and the Man itself are often designed in response to a theme, with elements that are independent of the theme but reconfigured every year.

Furthermore, the theme is not necessarily compulsorily applied to all camps/works, but rather functions as a "suggestionary framework".

---

### Conclusion: Future city experiment in the desert

Burning Man is a modern cultural experimental city that has evolved from Inferno (1995) → Decommodification (1996) → Fertility (1997) → Vault of Heaven (2004) → 2010–2025 theme, fusing spirituality, participatory art, decommercialization, and life expression.

The theme, which changes every year, and the large-scale artwork function as a device for participants to question their values ​​and social relationships through their experiences. The ephemeral cities built in the desert are etched in the memories of individuals and continue to have a lasting impact on society, culture, and creativity.

That's the essence of Burning Man: even when the desert bonfires go out, the spirit continues to burn into the next year and into our imaginations.
