---


"Koochy" was released in 2000 as the lead single from Armand Van Helden's fourth studio album, Killing Puritans (2000).

Extensive sampling of Gary Numan's 1979 single "Cars".

Armand Van Helden is a DJ, record producer, remixer, and songwriter from Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

He was born on February 16, 1970 to a father of Dutch and Indonesian descent and a mother of French and Lebanese descent.

Because his father was in the U.S. Air Force, he spent his childhood moving around the world, including the Netherlands, Latvia, Turkey, and Italy.

He bought a drum machine at the age of 13 and started DJing two years later.

With a career spanning over 30 years, he is known as a stalwart in the house music world.

Van Helden"s best known singles are "You Don"t Know Me," "I Want Your Soul," "My My My" (featuring Tara McDonald), and "Bonkers" (featuring Dizzee Rascal). Both songs reached number one on the UK dance charts and peaked at number two on the Billboard dance charts.
