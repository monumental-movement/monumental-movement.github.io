## Prologue: What a film without words says


Text: mmr｜Theme: About the artistic milestone of the second half of the 20th century, where video and minimal music merged

"Koyanisqatsi, directed by Godfrey Reggio and with music by Philip Glass, is a work that fundamentally changed the horizons of film and music in the second half of the 20th century."

> "Life out of balance."
> ― Koyaanisqatsi (Hopi)



In 1982, an unusual feature-length documentary emerged from the American independent film scene.
**Koyaanisqatsi** --Directed by **Godfrey Reggio**, music by **Philip Glass**.

There is no narration or dialogue in this movie.
What is shown are only images of nature and human society. And what runs through them is Glass's **minimal music**.
His rhythmic structure and aesthetics of repetition, while resonating with the flow of the images, depict the ""transformation of modern civilization'' in the form of sound.

## Chapter 1: Visual poetry as apocalypse

The film's title, "Koyaanisqatsi," is a Hopi word meaning "life out of balance."
Reggio held up this word as a symbol of the industrial and information society of the latter half of the 20th century.

In the opening video, a reddish-brown rocky mountain towering in the wilderness is shown, and the low-pitched **chorus ""Koyaanisqatsi''** echoes in the silence.
Eventually, the sounds of human civilization's machines, the hustle and bustle of the city, and the acceleration of consumer society begin to overlap as a rhythm.

> Natural and artificial. Silence and overcrowding. light and speed.
> This movie is a series of contrasts, and that is the message.

---

## Chapter 2: Philip Glass's Sound Construction

Glass's music is based on repetition, but it is not just repetition.
The layering of minute changes creates a **"difference between stillness and movement"**.

His score is precisely in sync with the cuts and tempo of the footage, as if the footage had been edited into music.
In fact, Reggio and Glass' production process involved editing in which the images and sounds echoed with each other.

> "I edited the music and composed the video."
> ― Godfrey Reggio

## Chapter 3: Production background and technical challenges

Cinematographer Ron Fricke is also a visual poet who later worked on ""Baraka" and ""Samsara."
The time-lapse photography/slow-motion technique he developed was still rare at the time.

The film began as a completely independent production, with no state or corporate support.
It is also noteworthy that, amid financial difficulties, a reverse process was adopted in which only the music was completed first, and then the video was edited.

## Chapter 4: Minimalism and Spirituality

Glass's music has a Western classical form, but is deeply influenced by Eastern philosophy and meditative music.
In particular, the rhythm structure is influenced by the vocal music of Indian musician Ravi Shankar and Tibetan monks.

Reggio is also a spiritual figure with experience in a monastery, and the entire film is structured as a ""prayer without prayer'' for modern society.

## Chapter 5: The correspondence relationship between video composition and music

| Scene | Music motif | Meaning/effect |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Wilderness and rocket launch | Sustained organ sound | Contrast between life and machine |
| Urban transportation/factories | Repetition of sequences | Endless labor cycle |
| Close-up of the face | Chorus and deceleration | Questions about the recovery of humanity |
| Collapsing Rocket | Silence and Decay | End of Civilization and Rebirth |

As this table shows, music is not just an accompaniment, but constructs the ""emotional syntax'' of the video.

---

## Chapter 6: Implications for modern times

The influence of Koyaanisqatsi extends to subsequent video works, musicians, games, and advertisements.
for example:

* **Tree of Life by Terrence Malick**
* **Christopher Nolan "Interstellar"**
* **Contemporary composers such as Sigur Rós, Max Richter, Brian Eno**
* Directly influenced **environmental films and VJ culture**

This work is not just a movie, but has become something that can be called an ""**audiovisual philosophy book**.''

> What Reggio-Glass presented was a loop of destruction and rebirth.
> That endless rhythm is also the music of glass itself.

## Chapter 7: Musical Analysis - Change in Repetition

Glass' compositional technique, ""Additive Process,''
It has a structure in which the number of notes gradually increases or decreases within a phrase.

example:
"123 → 1234 → 12345 → 2345 → 345"

These minute changes create the illusion of time, in which the object is moving even though it is stationary.
It perfectly corresponds to the sense of time in slow motion and time-lapse movies.

## Chapter 8: Ideological continuity of the Qatsi trilogy

| Work | Meaning (Hopi) | Subject |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| **Koyaanisqatsi** | Life out of balance | Madness of industrial society |
| **Powaqqatsi** | A life that sucks the lives of others | Globalization and exploitation |
| **Naqoyqatsi** | Life through technology | Loss in the digital age |

With the trilogy as a whole, Reggio and Glass can be said to have reconstructed a ""modern myth.''

---

## Final chapter: Towards rebirth in silence

At the end of "Koyanisqatsi", the remains of a rocket that failed to launch,
It slowly falls to the ground.
The moment Glass's music quietly fades away, the audience is suddenly enveloped in ""silence.''

It is not the collapse of civilization, but a blank space for rebirth.

> When the sound stops, we finally begin to hear the world.
