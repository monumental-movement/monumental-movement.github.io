## ■ Hard rock and outlaw lifestyle

More than just a music genre, hard rock has often been talked about as an inseparable ""way of life.''
Symbols of this were the **muscle cars** and **Harley-Davidsons**, which were born from the background of American culture.

The 1960s and 1970s were a tumultuous time for the United States, with the Vietnam War becoming a quagmire, the civil rights movement, and the clash between conservative values ​​and counterculture. Young people who rebelled against the existing order and social norms sought self-expression using the keyword "freedom," and rock and motor culture were symbolic means for this.

The roar of the large-displacement engine was as wild as the distortion emitted from a Marshall amplifier, and it shook the hearts of the listeners. **Speed, power, and the freedom to deviate from the norm** - these came together to form the "outlaw lifestyle."

## ■ "Easy Rider" and the atmosphere of the times

The 1969 movie ""Easy Rider'' is a symbol of the youth culture and hard rock lifestyle of the time.
The protagonists" journey across America on motorcycles in search of freedom was not just a journey, but a metaphor for ""breaking away from the system.'' Steppenwolf"s "Born To Be Wild", which plays on the soundtrack, resonates with the roar of motorcycles and is still passed down as a hard rock anthem of freedom.

This film can be said to have defined the intimate relationship between hard rock and car culture by visualizing the moment when music, motorcycles, and freedom came together.

## ■ "Car" and "motorcycle" effects seen in AC/DC and KISS

Global hard rock bands **AC/DC** and **KISS** have captivated audiences by incorporating car culture not only in their music but also in their performances.

- AC/DC, as exemplified by songs such as ""Highway to Hell" and ""Thunderstruck," overlaid images of ""road," ""thunder," and ""speeding'' on rock music, directly linking music to the sensation of driving.
- At KISS' live performance, the sound of a Harley engine echoed with the flames in the background, giving the audience an experience as if the stage itself had been transformed into an American road movie.

This echoed the 1970s American "culture of speed," and hard rock strongly embraced cars and motorcycles as symbolic icons of popular culture.

---

## ■ Engine sound = another rock sound

Hard rock is supported by more than just explosive guitars and heavy drums.
For fans, the sound of the engine itself was "another kind of rock"n"roll."

- **The roar of the V8 engine** resonates with the guitar riff, giving the listener a sense of physical release.
- The sound of an engine is ""uncontrolled noise,'' and it overlaps with the rebellious spirit of rock, as it disrupts social order and silence.

The roar of cars and motorcycles driving away was itself a musical experience, a ""rebellion through sound'' against existing values.

## ■ Acceptance in Japan - Connection with Bosozoku culture

This composition of ""hard rock x car/motorcycle culture'' was uniquely developed in Japan as well.
Bosozoku, which appeared in Japanese youth culture from the late 1970s to the 1980s, had a similar spirit to American outlaw culture in that they used domestically produced motorcycles rather than Harleys as their mainstay, but expressed themselves through engine sounds and noises.

Many Japanese hard rock fans and heavy metal enthusiasts incorporated motorcycles and modified cars as part of their lifestyle, and the resonance between music and motor culture was certainly alive and well in Japanese society. This can be said to be the result of America"s longing for "freedom" being superimposed on Japan"s "delinquent culture."

---

## ■ Resonance between music and car culture

Understanding hard rock is more than just listening to albums.
The existence of ""Harleys running down the road" and ""muscle cars cutting through the night" is essential, and the combination of their visuals and roaring sounds forms the overall cultural picture.

When the roar of the engine and the guitar riff resonate, the music shakes not only the auditory senses but also the entire body, turning the audience into ""experiencers.'' This is where the core of hard rock, unlike any other genre, lies.

## Hard rock and outlaw lifestyle

Hard rock is more than just a genre of music and is often referred to as a ""lifestyle.'' Symbolic of this are American muscle cars and Harley-Davidson.
The roar of the large-displacement engine echoes through the city, resembling the distortion emitted by a guitar amp. As if music and machinery resonate at the same frequency, riders and drivers flaunt their presence.

It also has deep ties to outlaw culture. Biker gangs and street culture in the '70s often had hard rock as their soundtrack. The desire for freedom and deviation from the norm is an expression of strong, irresistible impulses, just like a hard rock guitar riff.

Visually, leather jackets, denim, tattoos, and rugged motorcycles and cars embody a ""rebellious aesthetic.''
From live music venues to highways, hard rock has always been inseparable from a way of life that involves explosive music, and that spirit continues to be passed down to this day.
