#Hyperpop/Digicore: The complete picture of the next generation of Internet music

Text: mmr｜Theme: Comprehensive analysis of sound, production, and culture originating from the next generation of the Internet

Hyperpop and Digicore are Internet-based music trends that melted the boundaries between pop and club music, growing around the TikTok, SoundCloud, and Discord communities from the late 2010s to the 2020s. In this article, we will comprehensively organize the characteristics of the sound, production methods, equipment used, and cultural background, centering on the genealogy that extends to **100 gecs / Charli XCX / glaive / ericdoa / underscores**.

# 1. Overview: What is Hyperpop/Digicore?

Hyperpop:

* Extreme fusion of pop x club x noise
* Excessive pitch processing, collapsing drops, and glittering high-frequency synths
* Large influence of PC Music (A. G. Cook, SOPHIE)

Digicore:

* DIY pop by young people originating from SoundCloud/Discord
* Lo-fi guitars, emo singing, simple beats, and artificial processing of vocal chains
* "internet-core" aesthetics represented by glaive and ericdoa

Although the two overlap, there is a difference in direction: **Hyperpop=excessiveness, Digicore=simple but internet-like**.

# 10. Summary

Hyperpop and Digicore are trends that were born out of the democratization of music production tools and the maturation of Internet culture. The ease of production, remix culture, social media spread, and the experimental spirit of young creators combined to dismantle the traditional genre structure and present a new form of pop.

In the future, it is likely to be further segmented and expanded due to advances in AI vocals, generated sound sources, real-time collaboration, etc.
