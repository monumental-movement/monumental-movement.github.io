## Mathcore / Experimental Metal

Text: mmr｜Theme: History, technical characteristics, major works, song structure analysis, performance techniques, and influence on related genres

Characterized by mathematical complexity, non-linear progression, and extreme dynamics, **Mathcore** is one of the most challenging styles of heavy music that rapidly evolved from the late 1990s to the 2000s. While this genre is based on the aggressiveness of hardcore and metalcore, it incorporates elements of jazz, experimental music, and progressive metal, actively subverting traditional 4/4 time and pursuing an odd time signature structure that can be described as mathematical.

**The Dillinger Escape Plan (DEP)** and **Meshuggah** are representatives of this field, and although they were active at the same time, they are extremely interesting in that they challenged the "extreme of complexity" from different directions.

## Birth and origins of Mathcore

### Evolution from hardcore punk

Mathcore's roots lie in the **hardcore punk** and **metalcore** of the late 1980s and early 90s. In particular, bands like Converge, Botch, and Coalesce began to introduce not only aggression but also **irregular riff structures, chord breakdowns, and sudden tempo changes**, setting the stage for what would become Mathcore.

### Boston-New Jersey Underground Scene

DEP appeared in the northeastern United States in the late 1990s, at a time when the fusion of hardcore and noise rock was active, and by combining this with "technocraticism," new variations with unprecedented speed and complexity were born.

---

## Innovation of The Dillinger Escape Plan

DEP was formed in 1997. His debut EP *Under the Running Board* (1998) and groundbreaking debut album *Calculating Infinity* (1999) earned him instant acclaim.

The following are the characteristics of their song structures.

### 1. Ultra-fast and fragmented structure

The technique of **changing phrases of 1-2 beats at high speed, rather than in units of measures, is remarkable.
The aural sense of direction is constantly shaken by the inserted breaks, polyrhythms, and misaligned accents.

### 2. Influence from jazz

Guitarist Ben Weinman reconstructed the tension chords and upper structure-like sounds of jazz using irregular tuning.
*Specific music examples are omitted as external links are prohibited.

### 3. Separation of vocals and acoustics

Because the vocals do not follow the instrument structure, it feels like the rhythm of the song and the band are not linked.
This "independence" is stronger than in other genres, and increases the experimental nature.

## Polyrhythmic structure of Meshuggah

Sweden's Meshuggah is a separate group from Mathcore, but is extremely important in its integration of polyrhythm and metal.

### Typical methods:

* The basic time signature is 4/4
* But guitar riffs go in cycles of **5 beats, 7 beats, 9 beats** etc.
*As a result, the riff and drum accents periodically "shift"

This allows the listener to experience both a linear groove and a non-linear accent at the same time.
This "multilayered rhythm" became the basis of later Djent and Experimental Metal.

## Performance technique: Skill set required by Mathcore

### Guitar

* Matching irregular accents **Right hand mute + alternate combination**
* Need to memorize "beat fragments" rather than measures
* Fast switching between tension chords and irregular forms

### Drum

* Dealing with **metric modulation** (the illusion of tempo)
* Multi-stage arrangement of snare accents
* Polyrhythmic simultaneous pronunciation (e.g. 5 connected figures on top of 4/4)

### Base

* Most important as a bridge between the "swing" of drums and guitar
* Often only the bass plays phrases with different cycles

### Vocal

* Features an "independent axis" of expression that is not bound by song structure
* Sudden switch between growl, scream, and clean in DEP

## Sound Design: Acoustics that support complexity

### Mix technology

In Mathcore, multiple tracks of distorted guitars overlap, so organizing the frequency bands is essential.
In particular, attack sounds tend to be concentrated in the **2-5kHz** band, and if this area is not properly processed, the outline of the sound will become unclear.

### Drum recording

* Emphasizes the "core" of kick and snare
*Tom's localization is not linear, and is often arranged in unique ways to match the complexity of the song.

## Spread into genres

Mathcore has influenced a variety of derivative genres since the 2000s.

### Contributing to Djent

Meshuggah's influence is significant. The introduction of irregular time signatures and low-pitched 7- to 8-string guitars led to its successor.

### Experimental Metal

The fragmented structure of DEP and Car Bomb has been incorporated into many modern metal bands.

### Post-Metal / Noise

While the complex rhythmic structure remained the same, there was an increase in the number of cases in which music was combined with spatial sounds and ambient elements, and the structure became more multi-layered.

---

## Current location of Mathcore

Mathcore from the late 2010s to the 2020s has become more integrated with technology, and while the rhythmic irregularities remain the same, the sound design has become more elaborate.

Car Bomb, Frontierer, Rolo Tomassi and others form the new generation.

---

## summary

Mathcore/Experimental Metal is not just "complex and intense" music, but a highly structured musical system that combines the spirit of hardcore, the freedom of jazz, the structural beauty of progressive rock, and the strength of metal.
The core of this lies not in complexity itself, but in the dynamism that results from the integration of complexity and chaos.
