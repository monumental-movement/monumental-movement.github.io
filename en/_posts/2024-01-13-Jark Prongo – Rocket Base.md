A producer duo working on Dutch house and techno. Jark Prongo is made up of Gaston Steenquist (Amsterdam) and Rene ter Horst (Haarlem).

Also known as DJ Zki & Dobre and René Et Gaston, they started working together in 1991.

In the same year, they founded the record label Fresh Fruit. Most of the tracks they released on Fresh Fruit were from before they left the label in 1995.

After their departure, Jark Prongo founded Pssst Music, releasing productions under various aliases as before, and in 1998 the real success story of Jark Prongo began.
