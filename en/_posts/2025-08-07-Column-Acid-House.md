Text: mmr｜Theme: Chemical reactions of sound and cultural transformation



<hr>

### Origin: Radiation from underground in Chicago
Acid house is a music genre that originated from the underground club scene in Chicago, USA in the mid-1980s, and is a subgenre of house music.

The origin of this genre was born from the "accidental misuse" of an electronic instrument called the Roland TB-303 Bass Line Synthesizer. Originally developed as a bass guitar replacement, the TB-303 was used by DJs and producers (particularly from a unit called **Phuture**) in unexpected ways, producing undulating, ""liquid" and ""psychedelic" basslines.

Phuture's 1987 single "Acid Tracks" became the prototype for this new style, both in sonic character and name.

### Sound characteristics: Chemical sound image brought about by TB-303
The most important characteristics of acid house are the following sound elements:


<hr>

#### Baseline with TB-303

- Unique "purpy" and "squish" sound

- Mysterious acoustic changes caused by filter resonance and slide

- Analog randomness and manual operation organicity

<hr>

#### Quadruple kick

- BPM is a stable tempo of around 120-130

- Standard combination with drum pattern by TR-808 or TR-909


<hr>

#### Minimal structure

- Trip feeling due to repeated loops

- Create a sense of ecstasy with long build-ups and detailed changes

This sound had a tremendous effect as a ""chemical sound'' that lulled dancers into a trance-like state in the darkness of a club or with strobe lights.

### Spread to Britain: Summer of Love and the Second Wave

Acid house rapidly spread to the UK from the end of 1987 to 1988. Club DJs brought Chicago's white label back to the UK, where it quickly spread through the London and Manchester club scenes.


<hr>

#### "Second Summer of Love": 1988

- The connection between acid house and ecstasy (MDMA)

- Expanding from inner city club to outdoor rave

- Centered in Shoom, London and Haçienda, Manchester


<hr>

#### UK artists who have influenced me

- [A Guy Called Gerald "Voodoo Ray"](https://amzn.to/4q8RJtT)

- [808 State "Pacific State"](https://amzn.to/3J8mz5a)

- Rave style with acid elements such as The KLF and Orbital


<hr>

### Fashion and symbols: smiley faces and DIY culture

Acid house influenced not only music, but also visual and youth culture.

**Smiley face (☻)**: Spread around the world as a symbol of acid house

- Yellow color, neon, psychedelic visuals

- DIY graphics seen on T-shirts, flyers and record jackets

- Highly compatible with the Zine culture and free newspapers of the time

This fashion continued into rave culture, trance, techno, breakbeat, and other scenes from the 1990s onward.


<hr>

### Spread and evolution of acid house
Acid house continued to evolve in various ways around the world after the 1990s.

### Positioning and re-evaluation in modern times

Today, acid house is being reevaluated amidst retro culture and the revival of analog gear. In particular, it stands out in the following ways:

- Classical return to festivals and raves

- Cultural reappraisal in zines, archives and art exhibitions

- Acid set popularity on YouTube and Bandcamp

- Explosive spread of TB-303 clone aircraft (reproduction of analog equipment)

More than just a musical genre, acid house continues to be at the nexus of electronic music and counterculture.


<hr>

### Acid never kills

Acid house is a rare musical culture born from the intersection of accidental technological innovation and the spirit of the times. More than 30 years later, the sound of the TB-303 continues to resonate on club floors and digital spaces, and continues to inspire future musicians.

Acid is not a reverberation of the past, but a sonic mutant that continues to evolve.
