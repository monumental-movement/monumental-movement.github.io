"Hidden Rooms" is one of Source Direct's best amen tunes. This track has been masterfully produced by a number of great producers and will be a perfect dancefloor hit with the first drop.

The sharp metallic sound that overrides the rapid amembark is one of the most notable samples and will give you goosebumps.

"Spice of Jazz" is also wonderful, and features many breaks.

#### Tracklist
