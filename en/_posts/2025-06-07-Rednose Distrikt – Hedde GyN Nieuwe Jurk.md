title: Rednose Distrikt – Hedde Gy'N Nieuwe Jurk
---


Rednose Distrikt began as a collaboration between Amsterdam-based band Kid Sublime and Steven de Peven, before Kid Sublime left and Mike Kivits, aka Aardvarck, joined.
Their sound is characterized by a mix of various elements, including broken beat, offside techno, cut-up soul, and sampled slapstick jazz.

This record is an abstract break house track released in 2005 by Rockwell Records, a spin-off of Dutch shop Rockwell. (promo edition)
