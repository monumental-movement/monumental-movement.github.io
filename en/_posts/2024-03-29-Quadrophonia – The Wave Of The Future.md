---


Quadrophonia is a project by Dutch DJ Lucien Foort and Belgian DJ Olivier Abbeloos.

"The Wave Of The Future" is a breakbeat hardcore techno track released in 1991.

The second track on side A is a remix by Mark Ryder (DJ Ryder).

Olivier Abbeloos was born on January 18, 1969 in Aalst, Belgium.

He was interested in music from an early age, and at the age of 13, his parents gave him a DJ set, and he started DJing.At the age of 17, he began producing music on his own, creating megamixes using two track recorders.

His first project was L&O's "Even Now", but his name is not listed in the credits, and he went on to form his first collaborative project, The Beat Machine, with Patrick de Mayer.

His name became widely known through his duo Quadroponia with Lucien Foort.

Meanwhile, T99 was initially a solo project of Patrick De Meyer, and after releasing three albums, Patrick De Meyer heard that Olivier Abbeloos was working on a song called "Anasthasia" and suggested that they release it under the T99 name.

Olivier Abbeloos agreed, and T99 started working as a duo.

The two later released their only album, "Children Of Chaos".

As a side note, Abrilos' brother-in-law is Olivier Pieters, who also worked in the import department of the record shop Target Records.
