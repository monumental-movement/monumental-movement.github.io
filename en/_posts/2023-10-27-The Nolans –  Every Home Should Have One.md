“The Nolans – Every Home Should Have One” is part of a series distributed as a prize in a Coca-Cola sweepstakes held in Japan in 1981.

The title of the record is "Adored Aye Aye" on the front of the jacket and "Adored Aye Aye Every Home Should Have One" on the back.

The record contains only the A side (label side) and the B side (signed color photo of the group) is not grooved. The record is packaged in a clear round-bottomed inner record bag and an outer paper jacket with a photo of the artist. The back of the outer jacket includes a brief artist biography (Japanese) and lyrics (English and Japanese).
