# Disco is not a "legacy of the past" but a living rhythm that supports the foundations of modern club and pop culture.
Disco began as a subculture in the United States in the 1970s, and evolved independently in Japan by merging with nightlife culture. In the 1980s, it gave birth to ""Juliana Tokyo" and ""Maharaja" along with the bubble, and in the 90s it became integrated into club culture, and since the 2000s it has been reinterpreted in the context of Nu-Disco and city pop. Today, it continues to live on in Japan's club/disco culture and continues to thrill dance floors across generations.
