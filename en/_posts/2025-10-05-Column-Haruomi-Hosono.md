## Quiet Revolutionary - Haruomi Hosono

Text: mmr｜Theme: From Happy End to YMO to Ambient—Tracing the "soundscapes" and cultural backgrounds drawn by Haruomi Hosono through the ages

**Haruomi Hosono** is a musician who has continued to transform Japanese pop music for half a century.
From the late 1960s to the present, his music has carved out a unique horizon by ""shifting the era" rather than ""defining the era."
Diverse cultures, humor, nostalgia, technology—all of these are blended into Hosono's sound.

Recordings at that time were made at Yotsuya Onkyo House's predecessor studio. Warm sound from analog tape recording and vintage equipment.
Although influenced by American bands such as The Band and Buffalo Springfield, they put literary Japanese lyrics to the fore.

#### Anecdote
Hosono, who was frustrated by the number of equipment problems during recording, reportedly said, ""I want a place where I can record the sound a little better.''
After that, it became the foundation for him to pursue his own sonic ideals.

That sound remains faintly in the final track.

In an era where the form of music continues to change, he still believes in the "stillness of sound."
