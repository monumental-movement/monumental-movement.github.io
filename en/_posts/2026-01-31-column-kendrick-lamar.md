## Prologue: The moment when hip-hop becomes a story

Text: mmr｜Theme: About Kendrick Lamar, who expanded hip-hop from fragmentary self-expression to a long narrative art.


Kendrick Lamar's body of work is not a collection of songs, but has a structure closer to a full-length novel or a classic epic poem. His albums go beyond the concept of "song order" and overlap personal and social history while manipulating time, perspective, and narrator. There is no chance or improvisation, but a carefully designed narrative structure.

Hip-hop originally developed as an expression that captures the emotions and reality of the moment. Every battle, every block party, every song on the radio had value in its ephemerality. But Kendrick offered a way to use the format to tell long-distance stories. The structure, which can only be seen in its entirety by listening to the album as a whole, requires the listener to actively read it.

Furthermore, his story cannot be reduced to self-praise or success stories. Rather, by actively placing failure, fear, regret, and contradiction at the center of the story, he visualizes the ""weakness" and ""silence" that hip-hop has avoided. This overlaps with the history of epic poems, which depict not only the glory of heroes but also their trials and sufferings.

> Kendrick Lamar stands at the tip of hip-hop's transition from momentary expression to long-distance narrative.

## The epic stage of Compton

### Geography and reality

Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born in 1987 in Compton, California. This city has been a symbol of West Coast gangsta rap since N.W.A. It was a space where violence, poverty, police power, and racial issues were embedded in everyday life. Kendrick's narrative never departs from this concrete sense of place.

Compton is more than just a backdrop; it has the power to define the story. Concrete details such as travel routes, intersections, residential areas, and fast food restaurants appear repeatedly and resist abstraction. Like a city-state or a battlefield in an epic poem, the city itself functions as a character.

### Narrator's position

He speaks not as a ""commentator looking in from the outside," but as ""a person who lives on the inside." The narrator is not fixed throughout, but changes from boy to observer to perpetrator to victim to prophet. The fluctuation of perspective rejects the simple dualism of good and evil and preserves the complexity of reality as it is.

This multi-view structure is similar to the back and forth between gods and humans, heroes and storytellers seen in classical epic poetry. Kendrick places himself in the lead role, yet maintains a distance from which he does not identify completely.

> Kendrick's story includes moments where Compton itself becomes the storyteller.

## Section.80: The story of generations divided into chapters

### The theme of generations

2011's ""Section.80" is structured around the generation born during the Reagan administration. The album title itself functions like a chapter number, ""Section.80," which depicts the impact of social policy, drugs, and educational inequality on the lives of young people.

### Structure of short story series

Although each song seems to be an independent short story, they are connected by a single line of generational criticism. There is still no clear protagonist here, and multiple figures are arranged in a sketchy manner.

> The story first spreads across generations before concentrating on the individual.

## good kid, m.A.A.d city: complete epic album

### The entire album is a story of one night

2012"s Good Kid, m.A.A.d City was the first time Kendrick Lamar"s epic structure came to full fruition. The entire album is structured as one day spent in Compton.

### Narrative device called skit

Skits such as voicemails from parents, gunshots, and conversations with friends serve to clarify scene changes and the passage of time. This function is similar to the narrator's vignettes and choruses in classical epic poetry.

A[morning outing] --> B[meeting up with friends]

D --> E[reflection and prayer]
</div>

### Transformation of the protagonist

Although Kendrick himself is a ""good kid," the process of being swallowed up by ""m.A.A.d city" is depicted as a series of trials in a heroic story.

> This album has one of the clearest narrative structures in hip-hop history.

## To Pimp a Butterfly: A fusion of myth and politics

### Abstract narrative

In 2015's To Pimp a Butterfly, the story becomes abstract all at once. Personal history expands into black history and American history, and the narrative becomes allegorical.

### Repetitive structure of poetry

The poems presented in fragments throughout the album come together at the end of the story. This repetition and retrieval has the same structure as foreshadowing retrieval in epic poetry.

### Conversation with Tupac Shakur

The dialogue with Tupac in the final track evokes the mythical motif of a conversation with a ghostly being.

> At the point where individual success and communal suffering collide, the story becomes a myth.

---

## DAMN.: Tragic structure that goes backwards in time

### A two-way story

2017's DAMN. is designed to have different meanings when played in reverse order. This is a tragic structure that moves backwards through time, questioning the relationship between choice and outcome.

### Seven Emotions

Each song symbolically deals with human emotions and sins, and takes on a religious allegory.

> This album's theme is the cause and effect relationships in the story itself.

## Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers: Inward Descent

### From public narrative to private confession

In this 2022 film, the story dives deep from society to the inner world of the individual. Themes of trauma, family, and healing come to the fore.

### Meaning of two-part structure

The dichotomy of Big Steppers and Mr. Morale separates the outward role from the introspective self.

> Here the epic ceases to be a heroic tale and transforms into a human confession.
