A techno track released in 2000 by US techno and ambient DJ/producer Steve Stoll.

The second song on the B-side is a remix by London-based UK techno DJ and producer Justin Berkovi.

B1 on this record stands out even more with its soothing yet powerful bass line and the perfect timing of pads.

B2's "Killin' it" is a bass-heavy track that leans more toward trip-hop than techno, with its dirty, deep bass and funky rhythm.
