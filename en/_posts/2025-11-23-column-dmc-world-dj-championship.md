Text: mmr｜Theme: History of the DMC World DJ Championship, technological innovation, crowdfunding, history of the world championship, achievements of Japanese players, equipment culture, Turntablism

Known as one of the world's largest DJ battles, the **DMC World DJ Championship (hereinafter referred to as DMC)** has progressed with the growth of turntablism culture since its inception in 1985.
The process by which hip-hop DJ techniques became independent as a ""musical expression" and was further institutionalized as a ""world competition" is a unique history unparalleled to any other genre.

# Chapter 1 Why was DMC born?
## 1-1　Disco music and the rise of mix technology
DMC (Disco Mix Club) was originally established in the UK in 1983 as a record pool service for club DJs, with the main purpose of providing remixed sound sources for DJs.
The background was the rapidly growing **club culture** in Europe and the **occupation of professional DJs**.

At the time, DJ technology was dominated by mixes that seamlessly connected songs, and scratching and tricks were still only being developed in certain hip-hop regions.

## 1-2 In 1985, the invention of "competitive DJing"
DMC founder Tony Prince came up with the idea of ​​showcasing the creativity of DJs as a ""competition'' and held the first DMC World DJ Championship in London in 1985.
Initially, this competition was not focused on tricks as it is today, but instead was a place to compete in song selection and mixing techniques.

# Chapter 2 Scratch Revolution: Hip-hop techniques reach the world

## 2-1 1987: DJ Cheese changed the world
An essential incident in the history of DMC is the appearance of DJ Cheese (USA).
At the 1986 tournament, he performed a routine that emphasized scratching and beat juggling, completely overturning the traditional mix-based rules.

From this moment on, the world began to share the value that ""turntablism, including scratching, decides the game.''

## 2-2　1988-1990: Toward the era of sampling, beat juggling, and composition
After Cheese, DJs didn't just play songs;
- Manually reconfigure beats
- chop the pieces
- Treat samples like instruments
It has evolved in that direction.

Particularly in the early 1990s, DJ Aladdin, Cutmaster Swift, Cash Money and others created routines centered around "rhythmic reconstruction," and the competition grew as a showcase for musical performance.

---

# Chapter 3 Analog golden age (around 1990-2000)

## 3-1 "World Tournament" format established
In the 1990s, DMC established the "6-minute routine system" that continues today, and in addition to the **Individual Competition (World DJ Championship)**,
- **Battle for World Supremacy**
- **Team Division (World Team Championship)**

will be added.

## 3-2 Advancement of Japanese companies
Japan has had a major influence on the DMC world since the late 1990s.

### Main historical topics
- **1997: DJ KRUSH joins the jury (symbol of international recognition)**
- **2000: DJ KENTARO becomes the first Japanese to win the world championship (highest score in history)**
- Since then, DJ YASA, DJ HI-C, Kireek (5 consecutive wins in the team category), etc. have gained worldwide acclaim.

In particular, KENTARO"s routine is said to be ""outstanding in speed, accuracy, composition, and musicality,'' making it one of the most symbolic years in DMC"s history.

# Chapter 4 Digitalization and reorganization of tournament rules (2000-2010)

## 4-1　Final Scratch, Serato, Traktor: Introduction of digital sound sources
In the mid-2000s, when **DVS (Digital Vinyl System)** became popular, there was a move toward allowing its use at DMC tournaments.
In 2006, the use of DVS in various formats was allowed, and the tournament, which had previously been limited to analog, accepted the style of ""manipulating digital sound sources with a turntable.''

This results in
- Freely use your own edited sound sources
- Greatly expands the range of routine configurations
- Increased tone play and melodic expression
Such an evolution is taking place.

## 4-2　Video qualifying/online
Around 2011, an **Online DJ Championship** using YouTube was introduced, opening the door for DJs from all over the world to participate.

---

# Chapter 5 Crowdfunding and DMC maintenance (2015-present)

## 5-1　The power of the community that supported the continuation of the tournament
While DMC is a world-class tournament, it is not a commercially huge organization and has always faced financial challenges.
In particular, in the late 2010s, as the burden of operating costs increased, DMC conducted **crowdfunding** multiple times targeting fans and the DJ community.

### Main facts
- A fundraising project was carried out by **DMC Foundation** and funds were allocated to the continuation of the tournament.
- Supported by DJs, equipment brands, and fans around the world
- Providing commemorative goods and limited content for supporters

As a result, DMC began to become more of a community-led and protected cultural asset, rather than a ""commercial event''.

## 5-2　Pandemic period: Switching to remote competition
In 2020-2021, the new infectious disease made it difficult to hold a physical event, so DMC held the world tournament completely online.
Equipment companies including Rane and Technics supported the competition, ushering in an era in which routines were valued as video works.

# Chapter 6 Evolution of turntablism technology
The history of DMC is also the **technical history of turntablism**.

## 6-1 Development of scratch technology
### 1980s: Establishment of basic technology
- Baby Scratch
- Transformer
-Chirp

### 1990s: Speeding up and compounding
-Flare
- Crab
-Hydroplane
- Orbit

### 2000s: Toward the phase of handling melodies
- Musical Scratch
- Melodic Play
- Tone play

These technological innovations will lead to DJs gaining a position similar to that of ""beat makers" and ""composers."

## 6-2 Team division and ensemble
As demonstrated by C2C (France), Kireek (Japan), The Mixfitz (Canada), etc., the team category is more than just an exhibition of scratch skills;
- Orchestration with 4 people at the same time
- Composed like a live performance
- Production synchronized with video

This led to the development of turntables being treated as ""ensemble instruments.''

---

# Chapter 7 Equipment history: Technics, Vestax, Rane, etc.

## 7-1　The overwhelming presence of Technics SL-1200
The equipment that has remained at the heart of DMC is the **Technics SL-1200 series**.
Robustness, torque, precision, and durability were all at the top level, and it reigned as the standard machine for DJ battles.

## 7-2 Vestax revolution
In the 1990s and 2000s, Vestax
- High torque turntable
- DJ dedicated mixer (PMC series)
, and gained support from turntablists around the world.
Vestax mixers were frequently used at DMC venues, and their presence greatly contributed to the development of turntablism culture.

## 7-3 Baton to Rane
Since the 2010s, **Rane** has been the official sponsor of DMC, and Rane Sixty-Two, Seventy-Two, Twelve, etc. have been used at many world championships.
This will accelerate a new DJ style that combines DVS and analog.

---

# Chapter 8 Global movement supporting DMC

## 8-1 Institutionalization of regional qualifying rounds
DMC established the flow of national preliminaries → national champions → world tournament, creating the foundation for each country's scene to develop independently.

## 8-2 Impact on education/schools
Turntablism has been around since the 2000s.
- DJ School
- Workshop
- University Music and Media Department
It was also incorporated into the club, and came to be evaluated as a genre of music rather than just a club technique.
