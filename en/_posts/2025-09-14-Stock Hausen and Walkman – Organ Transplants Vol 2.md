Stock, Hausen & Walkman (Andrew Sharpley & Matt Wand) was a British experimental electronic unit active from 1991 to 2001. Their sound is a mix of cut-up, sampling, musique concrète, and junk pop elements.

"Organ Transplants Vol. 2" is the second release following "Organ Transplants" (1996), which was highly praised as a symbol of the experimental electronica/post-modern sampling culture of the 1990s.

It was released in 2000 on Matt Wand's Hot Air label.
