## Early career and early career


Text: mmr｜Theme: Influence on modern jazz masters including Miles Davis


Ahmad Jamal was born on July 2, 1925 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. His birth name was Frederick Russell Jones, and he was interested in music from an early age. At the age of five, he began playing the piano and, at the encouragement of his mother, received formal musical training. Pittsburgh was a thriving jazz city at the time, with plenty of opportunities to perform at local clubs and radio stations.

While in high school, he began playing in local dance bands, laying the foundation for jazz. In 1944, he began performing professionally at local clubs. During World War II, he served as a musician in the Army, playing piano in the military orchestra. During this period, he gained experience in improvisation and small trios, which influenced his later style.

After the war, Jamal moved to New York and made his first recording in 1947. In 1949, he recorded some works under his own name, and it was around this time that he began to develop the characteristics of ""minimalist piano performances that make use of space.''

## Important career turning point

### 1951 — Debut album "New Talent"

Jamal"s first album as a leader was 1951"s New Talent, an album centered around a small trio format. At the time, big bands were the mainstream in the jazz world, but Jamal offered a unique approach to utilizing space and rhythm through his three-piece piano trio.

### 1955–56 — The success of At the Pershing: But Not for Me

Formed in 1955, the Ahmad Jamal Trio (Israel Crosby on bass, Vernel Fournier on drums) performed regularly at Chicago's Pershing Lounge. A recording of this live performance, released in 1958, At the Pershing: But Not for Me, was a huge commercial and critical success. The performance of "Poinciana" in particular was a hit, and had a great impact not only on jazz fans but also on general listeners.

This album features:

- **Utilization of space (space)**: Emphasize the tension and depth of the music by playing with an awareness of blank space.
- **Minimal Phrases**: Less ornamentation, emphasis on repeating themes and rhythms
- **Interactive trio performance**: Bass and drums work closely with piano

This style also influenced Miles Davis and contributed to the later development of modal jazz.

### 1960s — international activities and further development

In the 1960s, Jamal began his international activities. He has toured throughout Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, and his unique trio performances have influenced jazz pianists around the world. In terms of recording, we introduced experimental harmonies and a new sense of rhythm, establishing an approach that goes beyond the traditional framework of modern jazz.

## Performance style and musical characteristics

Ahmad Jamal's playing has a unique presence in modern jazz. His characteristic feature is that he plays with an emphasis on space, rather than simply relying on technique or fast playing. By making use of the blank spaces, the resonance of each note and changes in rhythm stand out, leaving a deep impression on the audience.

### 1. Utilization of rhythm space
Jamal creates space between phrases and builds rhythm and melody in response to each other. This method was later cited by Miles Davis as ""one of the pianists who influenced me the most,'' and it also influenced the development of modal jazz.

### 2. Minimal approach
The performance focuses on simple phrases with no decorations, and clearly presents the theme to the listener. The repetition and rhythmic changes give the performance a sense of dynamic tension.

### 3. Interactive performance in trio formation
The representative Ahmad Jamal Trio (piano, bass, drums) developed an interactive performance in which each instrument responded to the other. The bass and drums are more than just accompaniment, working closely with the piano to create an improvised dynamic.

### 4. Harmony and Modal Approach
Jamal excels at playing chords and modal scales, creating a flexible sound that goes beyond the complexity of traditional bebop. This allows the audience to experience a simple yet profound performance.

## Impact and evaluation for posterity

Ahmad Jamal's music occupies a unique place in jazz history. Its influence was revolutionary in that it went beyond simply passing on a style and remade the musical ""space'' itself.

### 1. Influence on Miles Davis
Miles Davis repeatedly cited Jamal as his ""most influential pianist'' during his lifetime.
In particular, the following points are important:

- **The concept of "Space"**
Jamal"s playing with blank spaces had a strong influence on Miles"s fashion era from the late 1950s.
- **Minimalistic theme presentation**
Jamal's sense of structure is also reflected in Miles' arrangements from his quintet period.
- **Trio dynamism**
The interactive approach between bass and drums also contributed to the formation of Miles' band interplay.

Jamal"s influence is so significant that it can be said that he didn"t just "like" him, but actually changed the structure of Miles' music.

### 2. Redefining the piano trio format
Prior to Jamal, piano trios were typically led by the piano and accompanied by a rhythm section.
But Jamal changed the structure like this:

- Positioned bass and drums as "equal instruments"
- The piano flexibly switches between the main melody and accompaniment roles.
- Composition with emphasis on dynamics and space

This innovation laid the foundation for the modern piano trio that would later be developed by Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, and others.

### 3. International activities and cultural influence
Since the 1960s, they have actively performed in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and have gained a large following outside the United States.
The impact is reflected in:

- Appearance at international jazz festivals
- High influence on non-American pianists
- Expansion of cultural horizons after converting to Islam (converted in the 1950s)
- Changing musical perspectives for a global audience

In particular, the fact that he converted in the 1950s and took the name ""Ahmad Jamal'' symbolizes his attitude as an artist with cultural independence.

### 4. Inheriting "The Art of Space"
Jamal's signature style, the aesthetics of tranquility, has been passed down to the following generations:

- Herbie Hancock
- McCoy Tyner
- Keith Jarrett
- Brad Mehldau
-Vijay Iyer et al.

Particularly in contemporary jazz, **performances that make use of minimalist structures and blank space** have become widely accepted, and Jamal is credited with laying the foundation for this.

### 5. Late evaluation and activities in later years
Since the 2000s, Jamal has developed activities with the following characteristics:

- Continues to tour energetically despite his advanced age
- Released many live albums mainly on European labels
- Active collaboration with young generation jazz musicians

In his later years, Jamal's reputation expanded from a ""master" to a ""living legend," and his calm and well-honed performances continued to be supported by listeners around the world.

## Conclusion

Ahmad Jamal was not just a ""skilled jazz pianist,'' but an innovator who changed the very structure of jazz.

- How to handle space
- Redefining the trio
- Prehistoric role of modal approach
- Huge influence on the next generation
- Global activities

Through these efforts, Jamal is regarded as one of the most important figures who shaped jazz from the 20th to the 21st century.
