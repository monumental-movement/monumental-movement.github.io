## From UK hard house to post-90s club culture

Text: mmr｜Theme: Background of birth, characteristics of sound, main artists, development in each region, expansion since the 2000s, and current situation

Tech House is a genre that fused the minimal structure of techno with the groove of house, establishing a unique presence in club scenes around the world from the mid-1990s to the 2000s. To put it bluntly, it is ""softer than techno and harder than house,'' but in reality it is a complex music culture that closely reflects the process of scene formation, regional characteristics, and the evolution of DJ culture.

## 1. What is Tech House?

Tech House is generally understood to be ""dance music that incorporates the structure and sonic processing of techno while maintaining the warmth of house.'' It combines the minimalism, metallic textures, and repetitive structures found in techno while retaining the funkiness and fatness of house.

The characteristics can be summarized as follows.

* 4-hit narrow range kick
* Tight bass line in the mid-low range instead of sub-bass
* Detailed placement of synth/percussion
* Minimal loop structure
* Vocals are fragmentary or absent
* Sustainable Groove for Clubs

Tech House is often confused with ""a subgenre of techno" or ""a subgenre of house," but it is actually a hybrid that bridges the two, and can be said to be music that naturally formed in the context of club DJ mixes.

## 2. 1980s to 1990s: Background of establishment

Tech House's origins are said to be the club culture of the early 1990s in Britain, particularly around London.
At the time, Acid House and Rave were popular in Britain, and a variety of styles such as Hard House, Progressive House, Techno, and Tribal House were mixed together.

In particular, the following trends were the premise for the creation of Tech House.

* Minimalism of UK Techno (Surgeon, Regis, Dave Clarke, etc.)
* A British take on the groove of US House (Chicago/NY)
* Mix of Tribal House, Garage, and Progressive House
* Genre-crossing DJ styles from Pirate Radio and the London club scene (The End, etc.)

The people who gathered at the club weren't just looking for either techno or house, but were enjoying long DJ plays that mixed elements of both. Through this process, he developed a sense of mixing that naturally combines the "hardness of techno" and the "warmth of house."

## 3. Mid-1990s: Formation of early Tech House

In the mid-1990s, several labels and DJs established Tech House as a musical direction.

The following are of particular importance:

* Mr. C (co-founder of The End, member of The Shamen)
*Terry Francis (Fabric resident)
*Eddie Richards
*Nathan Coles
* Wiggle (Party and Label)
* Swag Records

While having house roots, they actively experimented with techno-like sound processing, minimalizing the groove, and tightening the bass.
One of the reasons why the name Tech House became so popular was because of their DJ mixes and long-time performances at clubs The End and Fabric.

The following is a concise diagram of the genealogy of early Tech House.
