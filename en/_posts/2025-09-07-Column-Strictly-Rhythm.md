## Why Strictly Rhythm was special


Text: mmr｜Theme: From the establishment of the legendary New York house label **Strictly Rhythm** to the present, organized by era from the perspective of historical background, representative masterpieces, and trends in production equipment at the time.


Strictly Rhythm (commonly known as Strictly) is a house specialty label founded in New York in 1989. With their A&R sense honed on the street and their club-oriented song selection, they led the 90's house scene in New York and around the world. The label excelled at discovering and nurturing DJs/producers while striking a balance between underground "sounds" and commercial hits.

## 1989-1992: Birth and "NY Local Experiment Station" period

**Historical background**: House/techno, which had sprouted in Chicago and Detroit, entered New York clubs in the early 1990s. It was a time when club culture was about to become commercialized, and an underground spirit of experimentation remained.

**What happened**: Founded in 1989 by Mark Finkelstein and Gladys Pizarro. Since our founding, we have focused on DJ-oriented 12-inch music, producing sound that connects directly to the dance floor and is popular at local clubs.

**Representative masterpiece (early)**
- Roger Sanchez — *Luv Dancin'* (1990, under the name Underground Solution)

**Equipment trends**
Many of the productions used turntables and samplers (early SP series and Akai) to take advantage of the "loop feeling" of records.

## A treasure trove of classic house

Strictly Rhythm provides A&R with a thorough understanding of ""what works in a club = good" and provides a ""testing ground" for producers. Although it was once closed due to capital issues, it was restarted and the company's catalog was evaluated, and today it has been reevaluated as a ""treasure trove of classic house music.''
