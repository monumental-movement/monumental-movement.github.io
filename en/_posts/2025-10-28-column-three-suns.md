## Prologue: Three suns echoing in the living room at dusk


Text: mmr｜Theme: Exploring the soundscape of postwar America drawn by a trio of accordion, guitar, and organ

A soft melody plays from the radio. What was ringing there was **Three Suns**――
It was a symbol of American home music in the 1940s, consisting of an accordion, guitar, and electric organ.

This was a time when the war was over and television was not yet widespread.
The music that played in people's living rooms was neither jazz nor classical music, but the sound that symbolized ""relaxation'' itself.
At the center of that sound was the **accordion**.

Three Suns' music quietly influenced generations to come, pioneering lounge, exotica, and space-age pop.

## Chapter 1: The Three Suns Phenomenon - Music for the Home

Three Suns was formed in 1940 by Pennsylvania brothers **Al Nevins (guitar)**, **Morty Nevins (accordion)**, and their cousin **Artie Dunn (organ)**.

At first, they mainly performed in nightclubs and hotel lounges, but in 1944, ""Twilight Time'' became a hit.
It can be said that this one song gave birth to the concept of "home music" in postwar America.

> 🎵 *"Heavenly shades of night are falling…"*
> As symbolized by this phrase, their music created an atmosphere of ""night.''

The sound of the accordion is connected to the nostalgia of soldiers returning from the battlefield.
The guitar and organ gently envelop it.
That sound was a "light of sound" that warmed the microcosm of the home.

## Chapter 2: The Role of the Accordion – A Pretty, Experimental Heart

Morty Nevins" accordion wasn"t just an accompaniment, it was a designer of melody and space.
The lead moves like a slide, the bellows moves like a breath, and the tempo fluctuates slightly.
These create Three Suns' unique **feeling of floating and happiness**.

In the 1950s, they signed a contract with RCA and released a series of experimental works that incorporated magnetic recording and stereo technology.
"Movin" "n' Groovin'" (1956), "Midnight for Two" (1957), etc.
It had sonic sophistication that it could be called **""living room electronic music''**.

> Accordion = not nostalgia,
> It functioned as a "breathing synthesizer" responsible for the future of sound design.

## Chapter 3: Lounge Culture and Three Suns - Interiorization of Sound

In the late 1950s, American society entered an era of affluence and a desire for "relaxation."
Modern furniture, cocktails and hi-fi stereo.
And music like Three Suns was playing in the background.

Their music was optimized for the interior spaces of homes, not clubs or theaters.
It was truly **interior design of sound**.

### Keywords of lounge culture at the time

| Element | Content | Relationship with Three Suns |
|------|------|----------------------|
| Hi-Fi audio | Popularization of stereo playback at home | Recording with acoustic effects in mind |
| Cocktail culture | Symbol of urban leisure | Music fused with "intoxication" |
| Home movies | BGM in the 8mm film era | Three Suns was frequently used |
| Space-oriented | Space-age aesthetics | Floating sound resonates |

## Chapter 4: Accordion Disappearance and Re-evaluation

In the 1960s, with the rise of rock and roll, the accordion rapidly came to be considered an "old instrument."
Three Suns gradually disappeared, and Al Nevins turned to producing.

However, in the 21st century, their recordings have regained attention with the reappraisal of Exotica and Lounge.
In particular, the sound of the accordion has come to be redefined as an ""organic electronic sound'' that predates analog synthesizers.

> The accordion is a symbol of nostalgia,
> Reincarnated into "lo-fi, psychedelic future sound".

## Chapter 5: Modern Reinterpretations - From Three Suns to Lo-fi Chill

Listening to Three Suns on YouTube or Spotify, their warm sound seems like the origin of modern-day **Lo-fi Chill Hop** and **Bedroom Pop**.
The ""ma'', where the density of sound is thin and exists like air, was the forerunner of digital music.

### Modern Successors

| Artist | Features | Three Suns elements |
|--------------|------|-----|
| Air | French duo | Analog feel and floating melody |
| Cornelius | Japan | Home acoustic sound construction |
| Stereolab | British and French | Retro-Future Sound |

## Conclusion: The accordion is still alive

The sound of Three Suns still lingers.
An old coffee shop on the corner, an old YouTube channel, or a lo-fi playlist.
Somewhere in there, I can hear the breathing of an accordion.

> The accordion is the "lungs" between machines and humans.
> That was the core of Three Suns' music.

Accordions are not outdated;
It is beginning to sound once again for the sake of an ""analog future.''
