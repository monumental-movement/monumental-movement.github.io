## What was 90s Euro music?──A feast of dance floors and melodies

Text: mmr｜Theme: The whole picture of Euro music culture in the 90s



<hr>

### What is the true identity of the music called Euro?

The ``Euro Music'' of the 1990s was not a specific genre, but rather a general term for popular dance-pop music that developed mainly in continental Europe.
The most iconic of these were ``Eurobeat'' and ``Eurodance,'' but other genres such as Eurotrance, high energy, and synth pop were also running at the same time.

In other words, the Euro of the 1990s was the ``pop image of modern Europe'' that fused party culture, dance music, catchy melodies, and technology.

### Common language between Europe and pop after the Cold War

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Europe rapidly transformed into a cross-border entertainment market."Euro-pop sung in English" began to enter the international market even from non-English-speaking countries (such as Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden).

This means that Euromusic is a musical culture that prioritizes sensory pleasure over political boundaries.Rhythm, synths, and a simple, repeatable chorus.These have become a "common language" that transcends languages ​​and borders.

### Acceptance of the 90's Euro in Japan

**Eurobeat**: Original development by avex

- Impact on TRF, globe, and Komuro family.

- At the core of Initial D and Parapara culture.

**Eurodance**: Disco-J-Pop hybrid

- Japanese groups such as MAX and V6 have released many covers.

**Fusion with visual culture**: Non-Western Euro culture

- It was also incorporated into anime OPs and game BGM, creating a “non-Western Euro culture.”

<hr>

### Why did the critics ignore it?──"Lightness" and "Anti-Art"

Euro music was not well received by critics for a long time.The reason is as follows:

- Simple structure, shallow lyrics (often nonsensical)

- Mass production/anonymity (the presence of specific artists is weak)

- Commercial success = disregard for artistry

However, on the other hand, it also proves that music can reach anyone.

<hr>

### Reappraisal and Revival: The Situation in the 2020s and Beyond

In recent years, Euromusic has been reevaluated in the following ways:

- Euro dance as the origin of Hyperpop and Y2K sounds

- 90s return (Post-Eurodance) in the club scene

- Like City Pop, Eurobeat from Japan was rediscovered by the internet generation.

Additionally, 90's Euro is reaching a new audience with increased playback on Spotify and YouTube.



<hr>

### Euro music was "pleasure without borders"

Euro music in the 1990s was a phenomenon that turned dance, pleasure, and melody into an international language, not lyrics or politics.
That lightness became a weapon that allowed him to transcend genre boundaries and values.

Now, once again, the "naive heat" of the Euro may be asking us a question that transcends genres and generations.

Is it nostalgia or newness for you?
