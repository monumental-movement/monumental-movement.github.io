## “The sound of the euro” Why do the sounds differ depending on the country?

Text: mmr | Theme: Genre: Music column | Theme: Comparative analysis of 90's Euro music by country of production

Although it is often referred to as ``Euro music,'' in reality, the ``sound texture'' and ``aesthetic sense'' differ depending on the country in which it was produced.
In the 1990s, the main battlegrounds for this genre were **Italy, Germany, and Sweden**.
Based on their respective cultural, industrial, and technological backgrounds, they were exporting their own ``sound of the euro'' to the world.

### Euro music was not “national music” but “national sound”
The greatest appeal of 1990s Euro music is that, while it functions as a ``universal language,'' it is actually deeply embedded with the cultures and aesthetics of each country.
Even though they are all similar, the heat of Italy, the hardness of Germany, and the coolness of Sweden are clearly different.

Music born at the intersection of global and local.That may be the essence of the 1990s euro.
