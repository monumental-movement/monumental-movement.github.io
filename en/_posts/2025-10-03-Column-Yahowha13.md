## What is Yahowha 13? - The musical legacy of Father Yod and the Source Family

Text: mmr｜Theme: About an unusual project that fuses music, religion, and communal practices that go beyond cult bands


Yahowha13 (also known as Ya Ho Wha 13, Yahowah 13, YaHoWa13, etc.) is a psychedelic rock/experimental music project with a strong improvisational and ritualistic feel, connected to the American spiritual commune "Source Family" that was active around the 1970s. The central character is Father Yod (real name: James Edward Baker). Although he himself was a leader in a religious movement, he was also deeply involved in music and sought to expand his teachings through his musical activities.

### Father Yod/James Edward Baker — Trajectory and Legend

#### Early life and career

Born July 4, 1922 in Cincinnati, Ohio. He later talks about his experience serving as a Marine (although some point out that his Silver Star medal cannot be found in official records).


Moving to the West Coast, he became devoted to the natural life movement, vegetarianism, hippie culture, and mystical thinking. He opened a health food restaurant called ""The Source'' on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, which reportedly attracted many famous customers.


Eventually, influenced by Yogi Bhajan's Kundalini Yoga philosophy, he organized his own religious movement, Source Family. The group led by him developed a lifestyle that integrated communal living, spiritual practices, music, food and health practices, and rituals.


Marriage, Wives, and Children: His legal wife was Robin Popper (later Ahom), but according to his followers, he had multiple wives (reportedly 14) and lived together with his followers.

---

#### Anecdote/Legend

Journalism and non-fiction articles have explored this dual nature, with anecdotes about him being a "soldier/former marine/war hero" and stories about him being a "cult leader/ex-marine/bank robber" with accusations of involvement in bank robberies and murders.


While the commune was in operation, there are records that there were disputes that are typical of cult operations, such as ""abandonment of personal property," ""cutting off of relatives," and ""permission to marry young members.''


On August 25, 1975, he died in an accident while attempting his first hang glider flight in Hawaii (he is said to have crashed and died approximately 9 hours later). This accident effectively became an event that symbolized the "end" of Yahooha13.


After that, the members of the congregation dispersed, but it has been reevaluated through sound archives and folklore. In particular, the 13-disc box set God and Hair (Yahowha Collection), released by Japan"s Captain Trip label in 1998, comprehensively covered Yahowha13/Source Family"s sound sources and became an opportunity for the revival of the legend.


---

### Musical development and composition of Yahowha13

#### Constituent members and naming history

Core lineup: Mainly Djin Aquarian (guitar), Octavius ​​Aquarian (drums), and Sunflower Aquarian (bass), along with other "Aquarian surname" believer musicians such as Lovely, Hom, Rhythm, Pythias, Aquarian.


Initially released under the name "Father Yod & The Spirit of "76". After that, the notation such as "Ya Ho Wa 13 / Yahowha13 / YaHoWha13 / Yahowa 13" was used with some fluctuation.


There was also a period when they were active in bands under different names such as "Savage Sons of Ya Ho Wa," "Fire, Water, Air," and "Yodship."

---

### Interpretation by members and testimonies

- **Djin Aquarian (Sunflower)**: "Our performance was not a song, but a prayer."
- **Octavius**: "Father Yod's perspective and breathing determined the direction of the improvisation."
- **Reminiscences of Source Family**: Recording was a daily ritual, and music was a communion with God.

In this way, Yahowha 13's lyrics and performances focused on ""waves" and ""mantra" rather than ""meaning.''

---

#### Musical characteristics/improvisation

Completely improvised performance: Many of the recordings were made with a policy of no rehearsal, no overdubs, one-shot recording, and no cutting and pasting.


Heavy use of tribal drums, bells, cans, chants, white noise, noisy guitars, etc. The composition is more like "ceremonial acoustics" than a song.


Although some songs sometimes have a melodic/singing structure, the overall focus is on sonic experimentation with an emphasis on spatiality, repetition, and ritual.

Lyrics and vocals (Father Yod's chants, line-style recitations, and congregational choruses) are often closely connected to doctrine, chants, and meditative texts.

---

#### Historical Phase (by year)

Yahooha13's music activities can be roughly divided into the following stages:

---

- **1973–1974**: Spirit of "76 nominal period

Kohoutek (1973), Contraction (1974), Expansion (1974), All or Nothing at All (1974), etc. The earliest experimental music period.


During this period, he was exploring the fusion of acoustic experiments and chant sessions. Many recordings feature Father Yod himself contributing cans, chants, and percussion.

---


- **Mid-1974 to 1975**: YaHoWa13 name period/technical deepening period

Ya Ho Wa 13 (1974), Savage Sons of Ya Ho Wa (1974), Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony (1974), I"m Gonna Take You Home (1974), To the Principles for the Children (1975), The Operetta (unreleased in 1975 → released later), etc.


During this period, attempts were also made to incorporate more "structurality" and "musicality," with a style that included a mixture of distorted guitar riffs, repetitive phrases, and fragmented poetry and singing.


In particular, Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony is said to be the most popular and re-evaluated work in the band's history, and has been reissued many times.

---

- **After 1975**: Father Yod postmortem/intermittent active phase

After 1975, the band disbanded due to Father Yod's passing. However, lay musicians continued to record and perform.


In 1977, Golden Sunrise (under the name Fire Water Air) and Yodship Suite (Private Press) were released. There is also a collaboration with Sky Saxon (former of The Seeds) and vocal participation.


Since the 2000s, there have been reissues and archive reprints, fragmentary new recordings, and member reunions (such as Sonic Portation by Djin, Sunflower, Octavius, etc.).

### Current situation/reassessment and legacy


#### Re-evaluation/Reissue

Since the late 1990s, Yahooha13 and Source Family recordings have been reevaluated by hardcore collectors and psychedelic music enthusiasts. In particular, 1998's God and Hair (a 13-disc collection) was an important milestone.


Since the 2000s, remastered reissues of original LPs and unreleased material collections have been released one after another by Swordfish Records, Drag City, Captain Trip Records, and others.


In 2012, the documentary film The Source Family (directed by Jodi Wille & Maria Demopoulos) was released, and this sparked renewed interest among the general public.


In 2009, a compilation of unreleased songs such as [Magnificence in the Memory](https://amzn.to/4nZE5aq) was released, which reignited the interest of fans and researchers.

---


#### Reunion/Activities

In 2007, the original members (Sunflower, Octavius, Djin) reportedly performed live for the first time in 33 years.


In 2008, they released Sonic Portation and made a piecemeal comeback.


Even after the 2010s, records remain of excavating archived sound sources, releasing recordings, and performing live (appearing at festivals such as SXSW).

---


#### Heritage and Significance

Yahowha13 is attracting attention for its positioning as a ""religious improvisational acoustic work" that goes beyond the framework of rock and psychedelic music, as ""music = channeling and practice that is an extension of doctrine and ritual."

It is argued that his orientation toward improvisation, spatiality, and transcendence left a considerable influence on later experimental music, improvisation, and sound art.

In fields such as commune culture, cult movements, and outsider music research, the existence of Yahowha13/Source Family has become a typical example and subject of research.

On the other hand, it also includes controversial topics such as ethical and historical criticism regarding the merits and demerits of believers and musicians, the fragmentation of records, and anecdotes and legends whose authenticity is unknown.

---



### Album details (by selected/notable works)

*The LPs are concentrated between 1973 and 1975, and were initially recorded and sold under the name Father Yod & The Spirit of '76, and later under the name Ya Ho Wa / Ya Ho Wha 13. Disc information varies greatly from edition to edition because it is a small press/archive.


---

[Kohoutek (1973/Father Yod & The Spirit of '76)](https://amzn.to/4ny1yQf)


Point: The earliest collection of improvised experiments. You can hear the "premonition of a ritual" where roughness and energy coexist. It is popular with collectors as an early record with strong chants of Father Yod.

---


[Contraction (1974)](https://amzn.to/4nW1868) / Expansion (1974)


Point: A series of "cosmic" series. Acoustic experimentation (percussion, gongs, long call and response) is noticeable. A must-have if you are interested in early "experiments with voice and sound."


---

[Ya Ho Wa 13 (1974)](https://www.discogs.com/release/5024800-Ya-Ho-Wa-13-Ya-Ho-Wa-13)


Point: The core of self-recording. While recording at Garage, the band began to form an improvisational structure. Djin (guitar) / Sunflower (bass) / Octavius ​​(drums) and others are required.


---

[Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony (1974)](https://amzn.to/4hdcYa5)

Songs and highlights: Contains long tracks such as "Yod He Vau He," "Ho," "Journey Thru An Elemental Kingdom," and "Ya Ho Wha." It is the crystallization of "ritualistic" and "psychedelic jam", and is the most easily available representative album with many reissues. It has a large soundscape-like dynamic, and we recommend starting here for first-time listeners.


---

[I'm Gonna Take You Home (1974)](https://amzn.to/3Wm92Ke)

Points: There are some songs that have a somewhat structured structure, and you can feel rough but melodic fragments. A work that features strong singing and chanting.


---

[Savage Sons of Ya Ho Wa](https://amzn.to/48S3oa6) / [To the Principles for the Children](https://amzn.to/4nAKucB) / [The Operetta](https://amzn.to/42ktDCf) (1974–1975)

Point: Experiment and "prayer (doctrinal) nature" are mixed. The Operetta was recorded in 1975, but remained unreleased for a long time and was released later. Another feature of this project is that there are many unpublished/fragmented materials.


---

[Re-edit/Compilation: Magnificence in the Memory (2009, Drag City)](https://amzn.to/48cPyPB)

Points: A compilation compiled from unreleased tapes. It has strong aspects of sound source preservation and remastering, and is well-organized for beginners. It received attention in reviews such as Pitchfork.


---

### Lyrics (poetic expression) analysis — typical themes and readings

Fact: Many tracks are centered around chants, fragmented lines, and religious declarations (Father Yod's "voice"), and official transcriptions of the lyrics are rare. It is rare for a song to have the full lyrics text in circulation, and the sound source itself is positioned as a ""document recording a ceremonial place'' (the sound source and track name are available on Spotify / Shazam, etc.).


Main motif:

Repetition of "Ya Ho Wha / Ya Ho Wa / YHWH (consonantal similarity)" - divine name/sacred role.


References to the archetypal "travel/purification/elements (fire/water/air/earth)" — a symbol that also appears in the album/song titles.


Doctrinal/ritual phrases (words indicated by redacted track names such as "man the messiah")—words that are improvised and layered as a leader's declaration.


How to analyze: Rather than simply reading the lyrics as ""lyrics = transmission of meaning," it is most useful to read them as follows: ""(1) The sound itself is a ritual / (2) Words are suggestive and poetic triggers that generate a communal experience on the spot." In other words, participatory religious guidance through "sound/repetition" is the core of the album.

---

### Lyrics and Interpretation

---

#### Lyrics and Interpretation of "Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony" (1974)

**Characteristics**: Over a long improvisational performance, Father Yod repeatedly calls out ""love," ""the universe," and ""truth'' like a prayer.

**Theme**: A metaphor for sublimating sexual energy into "union with the universe." The title "Penetration" refers not only to the physical meaning but also to "penetrating into the depths of consciousness."

**Recurring Motifs**: "God", "Love", "Children", "Cosmic Light", etc.

---

#### Tracks under the name "Ya Ho Wha 13"

The focus is on "spell-like vocalizations" rather than lyrics. The words sound more like a shout or a chant than clearly sung.

The sound "Ya Ho Wha" itself is a sacred mantra of the Source Family, an expression of the "name of God" that the Yods used on a daily basis.

---

#### "Man the Messiah"

**Contents**: Urges Man to awaken as a "messian being".

**Vocal Expression**: The preaching tone and calls like "Wake up" and "The time is now" are impressive.

**Interpretation**: Goes beyond the Christian image of a ""savior" and embodies the New Age idea that ""anyone can become the Messiah."

### Yahowha 13 and Source Family ─ Supplemental Interpretation Based on Testimony


#### Improvisation and the sense of unity of a "family community"

Former member Sunflower (Djin Aquarian) said in an interview, ""Our performances were not songs, but prayers, and the energy of the community was expressed in sound.''

Yahowha 13's sessions were held without prior rehearsal, with members receiving the "Yodo energy" and improvising sounds.

For this reason, it can be said that the lyrics are not ""constructed poems,'' but rather a style that repeats fragments of divine names and spiritual phrases.

---

#### Role of Father Yod

According to family accounts, Yod (James Edward Baker) was originally a restaurateur turned spiritual leader of the Source Family.

It is said that he was aware of his role in music as a ""conduit of energy" rather than a ""performer."

Member Octavius ​​says, ""He let us play, but at the same time he was 'listening' to us.His gaze and his breathing determined the direction of the session.''

---

#### Communal life and music

The Source Family lived together in a Hollywood mansion called The Father House, where they practiced daily meditation, vegetarianism, yoga, and group activities.

Making music was an "extension of everyday life," and his living room and basement became his studio.

One family member recalled, ""Recording is a sacred ritual, and as long as you have a microphone and a tape recorder, the energy of the universe will naturally flow into you.''

---

#### Interpretation of lyrics and mantra nature

The words "Ya Ho Wha" are not just a band name, but the "name of God" that was chanted on a daily basis within the Source Family.

According to the members' testimonies, this was a variation of "Yahweh," and the pronunciation was designed to intuitively sense the sacredness that resides in the sound.

Therefore, Yahowha 13's lyrics aimed for a meditative and magical effect rather than a literary meaning, and emphasized ""vibration'' rather than meaning.

---

#### Interpretation of death and its aftermath

In 1975, Yod died in a hang gliding accident, but his family said, ""He threw off his body," and viewed his death not as sadness but as ""a transition to the next stage."

After that, the members of Yahowha 13 continued their activities on a piecemeal basis, and from the 1990s onwards, they were reevaluated through reissues and documentaries.

A book of testimonies, The Source: The Untold Story of Father Yod, YaHoWha 13, and The Source Family, describes the complex experience as both "destructive and liberating."

---

#### Summary of supplementary interpretations

What emerges from the testimonies of members and their families is:

Yahowha 13's music is not a ""song" but a ""record of community prayer."

The lyrics had a mantra-like power rather than meaning.

Father Yod is not a performer, but a "spiritual conductor."

Even after his death, his music continues to live on as a "spiritual legacy."


---

### In conclusion

More than just a "cult band," Yahowha13/Father Yod left a strong impression on future generations as an unusual project that fused music, religion, and communal practices. His sound, which straddles the line between improvisation, ritual, madness and mystery, still provokes listeners even today.

More than just psychedelic rock, Yahowha 13 and Father Yod's music was a sonic ritual that embodied the hippie culture and community spirit of the 1970s. Under the guidance of Father Yod, Source Family members translated spiritual energy into sound through improvisation, with lyrics and chants that functioned more as mantra-like vibrations than literary meaning.

His recordings, such as the albums Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony and I"m Gonna Take You Home, document a fusion of religious ritual and psychedelic improvisation that remains evocative even to modern listeners. It has been reevaluated in the United States as a document of cult history, in Germany as an acoustic experiment, and in Japan as an esoteric psychedelic religion, with each culture developing its own unique interpretations.

Today, through streaming and reissues, Yahowha 13's music is widely accessible, and their cult past has culminated in their influence on the contemporary music scene. The spirit of Father Yod and the experimental spirit of Source Family go beyond mere music and continue to challenge new generations to the possibilities of community, improvisation, and spirituality.
