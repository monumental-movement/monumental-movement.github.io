# Complete history of French hip hop

Text: mmr｜Theme: Focusing on NTM and IAM, explanations of each album and song, social background, regional style analysis, and chronology.

French hip-hop is a cultural movement that was born in the suburbs of French cities in the late 1980s, and while influenced by American hip-hop, it has developed to reflect its own social and cultural background.
In particular, young people from immigrant communities and low-income families have adopted rap as a way to express their voices, and the lyrics contain political and social messages.
