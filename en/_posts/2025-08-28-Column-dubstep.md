Text: mmr｜Theme: The birth and cultural influence of dubstep

<hr>

### The birth of dubstep - from the basements of South London

Dubstep was born in the underground scene of south London in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It is characterized by an aesthetic that can be described as ""bass supremacy"' while drawing on the trends of UK garage, 2-step, jungle, and drum"n'bass.

London at the time was a melting pot of immigrant cultures, with deep roots in reggae, dub, and Jamaican sound system culture.

Dubstep, which was born from this soil, has undergone a unique evolution centered on heavy sub-bass, dark and tight spatiality, and subdivided rhythms.

### Sound characteristics

Dubstep is supported by the physical pressure of bass sounds, so much so that it is said to be ""music that you listen to with your body.''

- **Tempo**: BPM approximately 138-142.

- **Rhythm**: Broken beat structure derived from 2-step. The kick is not a four-beat beat, but the snare is emphasized on the third beat.

- **Bass**: Characterized by deep sub-bass, distorted bass line, and so-called "Wobble Bass".

- **Mood**: Dark, minimal or experimental sound design.

Representative early artists include Skream, Benga, Digital Mystikz (Mala & Coki), and Loefah. Their activities revolved around the legendary London club Plastic People.

### Media and events that supported the scene

- **DMZ**: A club event hosted by Digital Mystikz, a symbol of dubstep.

- **Rinse FM**: A pirate radio station that promoted the experimental sounds of unknown artists.

- **Hatcha's DJ Set**: An important element that defined early dubstep.

### International expansion and transformation

From around 2008, dubstep spread beyond the UK underground and spread around the world.

### Dubstep in Japan

It gradually became popular in Japan in the late 2000s, and Goth-Trad attracted worldwide attention. His sound has undergone a unique evolution, incorporating the context of noise/experimental music while also linking to the London scene.
A uniquely Japanese dubstep culture was formed through events held at clubs in Shibuya and releases from domestic labels.

### Cultural influence of dubstep

- **Penetration into the EDM scene**: Connected to festival culture and becoming a presence that resonates on the main stage.

- **Re-evaluation of bass music**: Significantly influenced the development of subsequent genres such as trap and future bass.

### Soundscapes symbolizing 21st century urban culture

More than just a genre, dubstep has become an iconic soundscape of 21st century urban culture.

The bass vibrations experienced through a club's sound system go beyond the sense of hearing, shaking the body and space, and connecting listeners with each other. Dubstep continues to evolve and will continue to be an exciting musical exploration ground for new generations.
