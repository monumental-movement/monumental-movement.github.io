## History of American hip-hop: Overall picture including regions, clubs, media, equipment, etc.

Text: mmr｜Theme: About hip-hop, where different styles have been formed in each region of the United States

Hip-hop was born in the Bronx, New York in the late 1970s, and has developed into more than just a music genre, it has also become a culture linked to dance, graffiti, fashion, and social movements.
In America, different styles were formed in each region, and development was supported by the club scene, radio, demo tapes, and record culture. Additionally, the development of sampling technology and the subsequent trend toward de-sampling symbolized musical innovation in hip-hop.

## Late 1970s: The origins of the Bronx and the foundations of club culture

### Region/era background
Young people in the Bronx hold DJ parties in abandoned public spaces and community centers. By repeating broken beats, B-Boy/B-Girl dance evolved.
Clubs and block parties were more than just music venues; they were a symbol of community unity.

### The importance of radio and demo tapes
At the time, hip-hop was popularized through radio programs (e.g. WBLS's "The Show"), and demo tapes were an important means of discovering artists.
DJ Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa played their mixtapes on local radio and at parties, helping to spread the word.

### Equipment/Sampling Culture
Introducing the Technics SL-1200 turntable, early MPC model, and drum machine (Roland TR-808). Sampling from records became central to music production, and DJs established a method of repeating the "break" parts of records.

## 1980s: East Coast Golden Age and West Coast Rise

### East Coast (New York)
Public Enemy and Eric B. & Rakim appeared, and rap with political and social messages was born. The club also served as a place to try out new beats.

### West Coast (California)
Gangsta rap develops. N.W.A. and Ice-T appear, depicting the street reality of Compton and Los Angeles.
A unique G-funk style was honed in the clubs and rolling parties of the West Coast.

### Role of demo tapes and radio
The new song was aired on local radio stations (KDAY, KMEL), and young people who listened to the demo tape spread it by word of mouth. In particular, local radio DJs acted as referees of the scene.

### Sampling culture

## 1990s: East-West conflict, the rise of the South, clubs and record culture

### East Coast vs West Coast
Regional tensions influence music, as exemplified by the conflict between The Notorious B.I.G. and 2Pac.
New York clubs (Tunnel, Limelight) became places for rap battles and the premiere of new releases, fostering a rap battle culture.

### South (Atlanta, Houston, New Orleans)
OutKast and UGK emerged and established their own unique sound. Tape distribution in clubs supported the spread of regional hip-hop.

### Movement towards desampling
Due to copyright issues and rising costs, an increasing number of artists are turning to original sound source production and live performance.
Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic'' (1992) skillfully uses sampling, while G-funk uses a lot of synths and original bass lines.

## 2000s: Digitalization and diversification of the club scene

### Club culture
DJ sets evolved at clubs in New York and LA. In an era before radio and streaming, songs became a buzz on club floors.
Before demo tapes and the internet, rap battles were centered around clubs.

De-sampling and equipment changes
With the spread of DAWs (Pro Tools, Ableton Live), it is now possible to create unique sound sources using synths and plug-ins without relying on sampling.
This increases the proportion of original beats.

Battle Rap and Freestyle are distributed online and are appreciated beyond regional differences.

### Equipment/production environment

Software synth (Serum, Omnisphere)

DAW (Ableton Live, FL Studio)

Expanding the use of plugins and sample packs

### Combined influence of region, club, media, and production methods

**West Coast**: Gangsta rap, G-funk, rolling parties in the clubs

**Southern part**: Trap, tape distribution, unique sense of rhythm

**Clubs and radio**: A place for dissemination and dissemination, a hotbed of freestyle culture

**Sampling → De-sampling**: Evolution to original production due to copyright issues and technological innovations

Hip-hop is a culture that has evolved through a close intertwining of regions, clubs, media, and equipment, and is expected to continue to expand with new technology.

## Specific example of sampling copyright litigation

- **Grand Upright Music v. Biz Markie (1991)**
Gilbert O"Sullivan"s "Alone Again" unauthorized sampling lawsuit. Since then, it has been clarified that samples without permission are illegal.

- **Bridgeport Music v. Dimension Films (2005)**
An incident involving unauthorized use of Funkadelic's guitar loop. It has become a legal precedent that the use of samples without permission, even for one second, is prohibited.

- **The Turtles v. De La Soul (1989~Settlement)**
Unauthorized sample in "Transmitting Live from Mars". Since then, De La Soul has been difficult to distribute digitally for many years.

---

## Role of mixtape culture

- Mixtapes by **DJ Clue, DJ Drama, DJ Screw** and others became a bridge from the underground to the mainstream in the 90s and beyond.
- **Southern (Houston, ATL)** ""Screw Tape" and ""Gangsta Grillz" formed the scene, making it possible to discover artists independent of labels.
- In the 2000s, Mixtape moved to "SoundCloud" and "DatPiff" and evolved into a means of promotion in the Internet era.
