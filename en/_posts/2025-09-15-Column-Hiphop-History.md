## History of American hip-hop: Overall picture including regions, clubs, media, equipment, etc.

Text: mmr｜Theme: About hip-hop, where different styles have been formed in each region of the United States

Hip-hop was born in the Bronx, New York in the late 1970s, and has developed into more than just a music genre, it has also become a culture linked to dance, graffiti, fashion, and social movements.
In America, different styles were formed in each region, and development was supported by the club scene, radio, demo tapes, and record culture. Additionally, the development of sampling technology and the subsequent trend toward de-sampling symbolized musical innovation in hip-hop.

## Late 1970s: The origins of the Bronx and the foundations of club culture

### Region/era background
Young people in the Bronx hold DJ parties in abandoned public spaces and community centers. By repeating broken beats, B-Boy/B-Girl dance evolved.
Clubs and block parties were more than just music venues; they were a symbol of community unity.

### The importance of radio and demo tapes
当時のヒップホップはラジオ番組（例：WBLSの「The Show」）で広まり、デモテープがアーティスト発掘の重要な手段でした。
DJ Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa played their mixtapes on local radio and at parties, helping to spread the word.

### Equipment/Sampling Culture
Introducing the Technics SL-1200 turntable, early MPC model, and drum machine (Roland TR-808). Sampling from records became central to music production, and DJs established a method of repeating the "break" parts of records.

## 1980s: East Coast Golden Age and West Coast Rise

### East Coast (New York)
Public EnemyやEric B. & Rakimが登場し、政治的・社会的メッセージを込めたラップが誕生。クラブは新しいビートを試す場としても機能しました。

### West Coast (California)
Gangsta rap develops. N.W.A.やIce-Tが現れ、ComptonやLos Angelesのストリート現実を描写。
A unique G-funk style was honed in the clubs and rolling parties of the West Coast.

### Role of demo tapes and radio
The new song was aired on local radio stations (KDAY, KMEL), and young people who listened to the demo tape spread it by word of mouth. In particular, local radio DJs acted as referees of the scene.

### Representative masterpiece

[N.W.A. "Straight Outta Compton" (1988)](https://amzn.to/46OFZoF)

### Sampling culture

Extract phrases from soul, funk, and jazz records using a sampler (Akai MPC60/SP-1200). Record culture was at the core of production, and DJs' knowledge of records was directly linked to their technical ability.

## 1990s: East-West conflict, the rise of the South, clubs and record culture

### 東海岸 vs 西海岸
Regional tensions influence music, as exemplified by the conflict between The Notorious B.I.G. and 2Pac.
New York clubs (Tunnel, Limelight) became places for rap battles and the premiere of new releases, fostering a rap battle culture.

### 南部（アトランタ、ヒューストン、ニューオリンズ）
OutKast and UGK emerged and established their own unique sound. Tape distribution in clubs supported the spread of regional hip-hop.

### Movement towards desampling
Due to copyright issues and rising costs, an increasing number of artists are turning to original sound source production and live performance.
Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic'' (1992) skillfully uses sampling, while G-funk uses a lot of synths and original bass lines.

### Representative masterpiece

**East Coast**: [The Notorious B.I.G. "Ready to Die" (1994)](https://amzn.to/3K94fcv)

**West Coast**: [2Pac "All Eyez on Me" (1996)](https://amzn.to/4261oak)

**South**: [OutKast"ATLiens"(1996)](https://amzn.to/4n9Fv2e)

## 2000s: Digitalization and diversification of the club scene

### Club culture
DJ sets evolved at clubs in New York and LA. In an era before radio and streaming, songs became a buzz on club floors.
ラップバトルはデモテープやインターネット以前、クラブが発信の中心でした。

De-sampling and equipment changes
With the spread of DAWs (Pro Tools, Ableton Live), it is now possible to create unique sound sources using synths and plug-ins without relying on sampling.
This increases the proportion of original beats.

### Combined influence of region, club, media, and production methods

**East Coast**: Breakbeat, social rap, record sampling culture

**West Coast**: Gangsta rap, G-funk, rolling parties in the clubs

**南部**：トラップ、テープ流通、独自リズム感

**Clubs and radio**: A place for dissemination and dissemination, a hotbed of freestyle culture

**サンプリング→脱サンプリング**：著作権問題や技術革新によりオリジナル制作へ進化

Hip-hop is a culture that has evolved through a close intertwining of regions, clubs, media, and equipment, and is expected to continue to expand with new technology.

## Specific example of sampling copyright litigation

- **Grand Upright Music v. Biz Markie (1991)**
Gilbert O"Sullivan"s "Alone Again" unauthorized sampling lawsuit. Since then, it has been clarified that samples without permission are illegal.

- **Bridgeport Music v. Dimension Films (2005)**
  Funkadelicのギターループを無断使用した事件。サンプルは「一秒でも無断使用禁止」と判例化。  

- **The Turtles v. De La Soul (1989~Settlement)**
  "Transmitting Live from Mars" における無許可サンプル。De La Soulは以降長年デジタル配信困難に。  

---

## Role of mixtape culture

- **DJ Clue, DJ Drama, DJ Screw** らによるミックステープは90s以降アンダーグラウンドからメインストリームへの橋渡しとなった。  
- **南部 (Houston, ATL)** では「スクリュー・テープ」や「Gangsta Grillz」がシーンを形成し、レーベルに依存しないアーティスト発掘を可能にした。  
- In the 2000s, Mixtape moved to "SoundCloud" and "DatPiff" and evolved into a means of promotion in the Internet era.
