Text: mmr｜Theme: From the origins of Shoegaze to the present

Shoegaze is a music genre that developed in the late 1980s, mainly in the United Kingdom, and is characterized by thunderous guitars, deep reverb and delay effects, and an introspective vocal style.The name comes from the word ``gaze,'' which means to gaze at one's shoes, and is said to come from the way the player plays with his head down while concentrating on operating the effects.

Below, we will look back at the history of Shoegaze by decade, and introduce the changes in representative masterpieces and equipment used.
