## From “music to listen to” to “music to feel” II

Text: mmr｜Theme: Ambient, environmental music, electronic music culture theory

Ambient is a genre of music that is not intended to be "actively listened to" by listeners, but rather to "exist in a space."
He eliminates clear melodies and rhythms and instead uses sustained sounds (drones), environmental sounds (field recordings), and acoustic processing to construct auditory landscapes.

This genre is extremely philosophical music that stands on the border between music and art, sound and space, perception and consciousness.

## ■ Before the 1960s: Ambient music as an idea

### Social background
After World War II, with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization, people's living environments became acutely aware of the contrast between "noise" and "silence."Artists and composers began trying to rethink music as an "environment" rather than "entertainment."

### Representative trends
- [**Erik Satie**: “Musique d’ameublement”](https://amzn.to/42JssfB) positioned music not as something to be actively listened to, but as a “function” that constitutes a space.
- [**John Cage**《4’33”》(1952)](https://amzn.to/4pOfrLZ): A radical experiment in which the performer does not make any sound and uses the ambient sounds floating in the venue as music.
- [**Musique Concrète**:](https://a.r10.to/hgipOu) Pierre Schaeffer and others attempted to reconstruct sound by making full use of recording and editing techniques.

### Equipment/Technology
- Editing with tape recorder (cut up, reverse rotation, speed change)
- Field recording (city crowd, natural sounds)
- It was a conceptual precedent and later became the philosophical foundation of ambient music.

- **Urban Soundscape Studies (R. Murray Schafer)**: Ambient sounds define the urban experience.
- In **modern architecture**, it has been introduced as an "acoustic design" that goes beyond background music, contributing to the psychological comfort of cities.

---

## Ambient and therapy (sound therapy)

- Use in medical settings (relaxation before and after surgery, improving concentration).
- Essential music for meditation and yoga.
- Research reports that ``binaural beats'' using natural sounds and low frequencies have a stress-reducing effect.
- By merging with psychotherapy and music therapy, ambient music has been established as "therapeutic music."

---

## Special feature on Japanese ambient artists

**Hiroshi Yoshimura**

- Representative works ["Music for Nine Post Cards"](https://amzn.to/429uNQV) (1982), ["Green"](https://amzn.to/4nN36pp) (1986)
- With its simple melody and clear sound, it has been reevaluated overseas in recent years.

**Yuji Takahashi**

- Interacted with avant-garde composers such as John Cage and helped establish experimental music in Japan.

**Ryuichi Sakamoto**

- ['async'](https://amzn.to/4pGHDAe) (2017) combines environmental sounds and acoustic art.Ambient elements have been deployed throughout his career.

**Kenji Kawai**

- Expressing an ambient space with anime music such as [``Ghost in the Shell''] (https://amzn.to/3VwvujB).

**others**

## Conclusion

Ambient is a ``spatial art'' that goes beyond the realm of music, and has evolved through connections with architecture, cities, psychotherapy, and technology.
It's not just a genre, it's "sound design for humans to live in harmony with the environment."

In the future, ambient will become even more essential as ``environmental infrastructure'' in the metaverse and urban design.
