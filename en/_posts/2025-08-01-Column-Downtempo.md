Text: mmr｜Theme: Chill-out and the aesthetics of deep rhythm



<hr>

### What is downtempo?
"Downtempo", as the name suggests, is a type of electronic music with a slow tempo.Generally, the BPM (tempo) is around 60 to 110, and it is characterized by relaxing rhythms and sounds aimed at listening and chilling out, rather than intense beats for clubs.

In between the throbbing heartbeat and the hustle and bustle, a sudden silence appears.If it's music, downtempo is that moment of deep breathing.In the world of club culture and electronic music, it is a music genre that is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the fast beats of techno and house, but it is close to the listener's emotions and blends into the city night.That's downtempo.

Downtempo is created through the intersection of multiple genres, including the floating feel of ambient, the grooves of hip-hop, and the organic elements of jazz and soul.
Although it often overlaps with styles such as chillout, trip hop, and lounge music, it is also used as a general term for a gentle groove that encompasses these styles.

### 90's Chill Out Revolution
From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the concept of a ``chill-out room'' spread in club culture, mainly in the UK.This is a relaxing space away from the loud noise of the main floor.The music that was playing in this space can be said to be the prototype of downtempo.

### Waves from Bristol, UK
Before the word downtempo became established, the music that could be considered its prototype was born in Bristol, England in the early 1990s.Artists like Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky explored styles that incorporated elements of dub, soul, jazz, and electronica with hip-hop beats.The result was trip-hop, the spiritual starting point for downtempo.

**Balearic Chill and Café del Mar**

On the other hand, ``Balearic Chill'', which spread around **Café del Mar** in Ibiza, Spain, is also deeply involved in downtempo.José Padilla's calm, resort-like mixes were popular as music to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, and became the prototype for later lounge-style downtempo music.

In particular, artists such as Massive Attack, Portishead, and Nightmares on Wax combined hip-hop, jazz, soul, and reggae with slow beats, forming a subgenre known as trip-hop.This became a worldwide hit, and the outline of downtempo became clear.

### Sound structure and aesthetics
The structure of downtempo songs varies, but the common denominator is a subdued beat and spatial production.The following characteristics can be seen:

- Loopy beats (breakbeats and hip-hop-derived drums)

- deep warm bass line

- Effect-processed pads and samples

- Quiet vocal or instrumental focus

- Sometimes includes elements of jazz, bossa nova, and reggae

**Tempo**: BPM is around 60-110.A relaxing speed that is slightly slower than your heartbeat.

**Rhythm**: There are many hip-hop style breakbeats or simple beats similar to ambient.

**Tone/Sound**: A fusion of electronics, acoustic instruments, environmental sounds, and samples of jazz and soul.

**Atmosphere**: Introspective, floating, urban, melancholic, or spiritual.

### Derivation and diversification: Downtempo around the world
Downtempo has undergone various evolutions through its fusion with local culture and ethnic music.

**Lounge music**: Evolved as music played in hotels and cafes (e.g. Thievery Corporation)

**Chillout/Balearic**: Mediterranean sound associated with beach culture (e.g. Café del Mar)

**Lo-fi hiphop**: A new trend of jazz x downtempo x nostalgia that has expanded on YouTube etc. (e.g. Nujabes, Jinsang)

### Modernity and Reappraisal: The Silent Rulers of the Spotify Era
In the streaming era of the 2020s, downtempo is being reevaluated as a "relaxing playlist" and "background music for work."In particular, the modern downtempo style known as post-trip hop has found its way into film music, game music, and even the fashion industry.

**While it is gaining attention again in the context of ``chill'', ``relaxation'', and ``concentration''**, there are many playlists on Spotify and YouTube called ``Lo-Fi,'' ``Chillhop,'' and ``Study Beats,'' which are familiar to listeners as downtempo in a broad sense.

In addition, the boundaries between environmental music and ambient music have become blurred, and music continues to evolve as music that is more closely aligned with an individual's psychological state and life scene.

Artists such as Bonobo, Tycho, Khruangbin, and Japan's Pictured Resort and Cuushe are important players in modern Downtempo.

### The art of sound that soothes the emotions
Downtempo is the complete opposite of party frenzy, but it has become an important style of music that supports modern people's emotions, focus, and recovery.Its power, which is inconspicuous but definitely acts on the mind, is truly a ``quiet ruler.''

In this day and age where technology is evolving and everything is accelerating, choosing to slow down is a very radical and humane choice.Downtempo is music that allows you to dive deep into emotion and space without competing for speed.

The next time you feel like ``I want to forget about time and drift away'', I hope you will step into the world of downtempo.
