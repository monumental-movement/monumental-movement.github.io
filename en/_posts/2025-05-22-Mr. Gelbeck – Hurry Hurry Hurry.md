Mr. Gelbeck, who unofficially releases high-quality house mixes, is rumored to be the pseudonym of a famous French artist.

"Hurry Hurry Hurry & Love / Apple???", released in 2007, is the first in Mr. Gelbeck's unofficial house mix series.
Side A samples the classic song ``You can't hurry love'' by the Supremes, and side B samples ``Eple'' by Royksopp, which was licensed by Apple and used as the introductory music for the Mac OS X Panther Setup Assistant.
