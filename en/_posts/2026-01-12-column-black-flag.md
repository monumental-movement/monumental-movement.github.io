## Prologue: The incident called Black Flag

Text: mmr｜Theme: About a band that left a legacy of method and attitude rather than commercial success


Black Flag was more than just a band name, it was a kind of structural change that pervaded the American West Coast underground from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. While they were known for their fast, harsh, and simple playing, they were also beset by practices that would have a decisive influence on generations to come: DIY, self-sufficient touring, and record-making independence. Musically, they continued to reject the linear image of punk, changing from their early three-chord hardcore to the heavier, slower, experimental sound of their later years.

The local characteristics of Southern California, suburban culture, repressive daily life, and a tense relationship with the police. Black Flag's music is inseparable from these specific environments. Anger and emptiness were not abstract things, but an extension of life. Each of their songs, tours, and records exists as a practical response to their environment.

> Black Flag was a band that functioned as a methodology, not a style.

## Pre-formation and early formation (1976–1978)

Black Flag's origins lie in guitarist Greg Ginn. When the band started in 1976 in the Hermosa Beach, California area, their name was Panic. It was a time when punk rock was beginning to spread from England and New York, and the influence of the Ramones and Sex Pistols was clear, but the scene in Southern California was still in its infancy.

Panic briefly changed its name to Black Flag. The name refers to the anarchist symbol of the black flag, and rather than a clear political statement, it contained a sense of denial of order and stability. The four-line design used as a logo was a simple and instantly recognizable visual symbol that would go on to become one of the most famous icons in punk history.

The initial members changed drastically, with vocals, bass, and drums frequently being replaced. This instability was a weakness, but also a factor that prevented the band"s musical direction from becoming fixed. From the beginning, Greg Ginn"s guitar playing was characterized by excessive distortion and repetitive riffs, and we can already see the beginnings of his later development.

> Early Black Flag was an impulse itself before it took shape.

## "Nervous Breakdown" and the impact of the 7-inch single

The 7-inch EP Nervous Breakdown, released in 1979, was the first record that defined Black Flag. This work was released by SST Records, which was later established, and was distributed as a completely independent production. The songs were short, fast, and direct, with an aggressiveness that was outstanding on the West Coast at the time.

The title track, "Nervous Breakdown," is about mental breakdown, but it's full of urgent energy rather than introspection. The lyrics are concise, presenting emotions as raw rather than descriptive. This approach became the basis for later hardcore punk.

Vocals on this EP are provided by Keith Morris. His singing was close to a yell, favoring immediacy over technique. The overall performance is rough, but the structure is clear and it"s not just chaos. The 7-inch format also required sprint-like concentration, which suited Black Flag"s early aesthetic.

> Nervous Breakdown served as the launching pad for West Coast hardcore.

## Keith Morris' departure and transition period

After the release of ""Nervous Breakdown,'' Keith Morris left the band. The reason is said to have been due to musical direction and internal tensions. Morris later formed Circle Jerks and developed a more immediate and fast-paced style of hardcore.

Black Flag continued their activities while searching for a new vocalist. During this period, multiple singers participated for a short period of time, and fragments of their sound sources remain. The band lacked stability, but that meant continued musical trial and error.

Importantly during this period of transition, Greg Ginn took full control and sought to maintain the band as a long-term project. Despite frequent personnel changes, the Black Flag name and philosophy remained.

> Instability was a precondition for change, not dissolution.

## Ron Reis and "Jealous Again"

The next important moment was the addition of Ron Reis (later known as Chavo Pederast). A representative example of the sound source recorded during the period when he was the vocalist is the 7-inch ""Jealous Again''. This work is particularly highly rated among the early Black Flag.

"Jealous Again" is about simple jealousy, and has an aggressive yet somewhat sarcastic expression. Ron Reis" vocals are a little more restrained than Keith Morris"s, and the outline of his words is clearer. As a result, the structure and rhythm of the songs become more pronounced.

This 7-inch showed that Black Flag was not just a collection of impulses, but was becoming more complete song by song. At the same time, tensions continued among the members, and Ron Reis also did not stick around in the long term.

> ""Jealous Again'' chronicles the progression of initial impulse toward refinement.

## Henry Rollins joins and turning point

1981 marks a major turning point for Black Flag. The presence of Henry Rollins, who joined as a vocalist. He was originally a Washington, D.C. fan and an avid supporter of the band. From the beginning, his physical and intimidating performance stood out.

Rollins" vocals, unlike those of previous singers, conveyed not only anger but also obsession and introspection. The lyrics also begin to bring to the forefront personal suffering and feelings of isolation. This change took Black Flag"s music in a heavier, more complex direction.

After his addition, the band began touring the United States in earnest. Performing in clubs, DIY spaces, and sometimes informal venues led to frequent clashes with the police and trouble, and these experiences were directly reflected in the texture of the songs.

> The addition of Henry Rollins propelled Black Flag to the next level.

## SST Records and DIY distribution network

SST Records is indispensable when talking about Black Flag's activities. It was originally the name of an electronics company run by Greg Ginn, which operated completely independently as a record label.

In addition to releasing Black Flag material, SST also actively released works by other underground bands. As a result, a unique distribution network was formed centered on the West Coast, creating a punk economic zone that was not dependent on major labels.

This DIY model set a realistic precedent for later indie rock and hardcore scenes. His attitude of producing records, printing jackets, distributing them, and arranging tours himself was inseparable from the content of the music itself.

> SST was the infrastructure that supported Black Flag's music.

## Change in musicality: From speed to weight

In the early days of Black Flag, speed and shortness were their weapons. However, in the Rollins period, the songs gradually became slower and heavier. The riffs were repeated, and the noisy texture became emphasized.

This change was not just an experiment, but also a reflection of life on the road, physical exhaustion, and mental strain. As the performance time increases, the relationship with the audience changes as well. Amidst the violent mosh, the music begins to take on the character of a kind of endurance test.

During this period, Black Flag expanded the boundaries of hardcore and laid the foundation for later influences on sludge, grunge, and alternative rock.

> The shift toward weight was an evolution, not a stagnation.

## Impact and legacy

Black Flag was a band whose legacy was more about method and attitude than commercial success. Their DIY ethos, grueling touring, and refusal to compromise musically became a reference point for countless bands.

The 7-inch songs ""Nervous Breakdown" and ""Jealous Again" are still talked about as the basic form of hardcore. On the other hand, the heavier, slower songs of the band's latter half dissolved genre boundaries and influenced audiences beyond punk.

Even though Black Flag is a defunct band, their methodology continues to be updated.

> Black Flag remains a never-ending question.
