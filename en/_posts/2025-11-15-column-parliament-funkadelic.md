## Prologue: What is P-Funk? A cosmic cultural revolution that goes beyond "funk"


Text: mmr｜Theme: About the worldview of P-Funk, which still exists as the foundation of current hip-hop, R&B, electro, art, and fashion.


In the history of American black music in the latter half of the 20th century, **Parliament/Funkadelic (commonly known as P-Funk)** is the group that combines the most grand myth and sound innovation.
Led by George Clinton, this collective was more than just a band, it was a gigantic project that combined a multiverse story, a futuristic technological sensibility, and the thoroughly physical rhythms of funk.

P-Funk becomes clear when you understand it in terms of the following three axes.

1. **Parliament: Epic funk opera type sound**
2. **Funkadelic: A fusion of psychedelic rock and soul**
3. **P-Funk collective: comprehensive art including musicians, costumes, space mythology, live performances, etc.**

This article provides a comprehensive overview of P-Funk's musical techniques, cultural impact, chronology, song analysis, and influence on future generations.

## Chapter 1: Birth of Parliament / Funkadelic - 1950s-early 70s

### ■ "Doo-wop dream" started in a New Jersey barber shop
P-Funk's origins date back to the late 1950s at the Plainfield Barber Shop in Newark, where George Clinton worked.
While waiting for customers, he harmonized with his friends and formed a doo-wop group called **The Parliaments**.

The dream of young black men at the time was the "Motown sound."
George Clinton studied Smokey Robinson's songwriting techniques and based them on beautiful choruses and catchy melodies.

## Chapter 2: The Rise of Funkadelic - The Psychedelicization of Black Music (1968-)

In 1968, George Clinton envisioned a "black Jimi Hendrix" and started **Funkadelic**.
After Larry Graham's slap, funk quickly became more rhythm-driven, but Funkadelic further blended:

### ● Musical characteristics of Funkadelic

* **Introduction of psych-rock guitar (Eddie Hazel)**
* **Rough Garage Funk Beat**
* **Black church gospel call and response**
* **Lyrics with strong political criticism**

In particular, 1971"s "Maggot Brain" is remembered for Eddie Hazell"s over 10 minute guitar solo.
It has been described as the "musical embodiment of black sadness and anger."

## Chapter 3: Parliament's Space Myth - Building the P-Funk Mythology (1974~)

In the mid-1970s, George Clinton began developing black science fiction under the name **Parliament**.

### ■Mothership Connection (1975)

* Concept: Afrofuturism x Funk
* Theme: "The black funk savior from space"
* At the live performance, a giant spaceship called "**Mothership**" descended, sending the audience into a frenzy.

To this point, P-Funk has strengthened the following elements in all directions.

### ● P-Funk space myth keywords

* **Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk**
* **Starchild (Warrior of Light)**
* **The Mothership (symbol of salvation)**
* **Bop Gun (Funk Weapon)**

These characters are integrated into the music, costumes, stage direction, liners, and artwork.
**P-Funk = the myth of funk as a comprehensive art** has been completed.

## Chapter 4: A deep dive into musical technique - Why is P-Funk's sound so "cosmic"?

What makes P-Funk unique is not just the strength of its groove, but its "structural control."

### ■ 1. "Rubbery Bass" by Bootsy Collins

* Octave bounce
* Laid back nori
* Heavy use of syncopation
*Using Distortion and Auto-Wah

### ■ 2. Drum "low gravity groove"

The drumming of Jerome "Bigfoot" Braley and others has the following characteristics.

* Minimal bass drum
* Snare is deep and back
*Hi-hat has a bit of shuffle

As a result, the beat feels like it's moving forward while floating.

### ■ 3. Opera-like depth of chorus and ensemble

* 5 to 9 people always overlap
* Arrange multiple singers with different voice qualities
* Gospel style response

### ■ 4. Horn"s funky "instruction sound"

* James Brown-style sharp accent
* But it has more play than JB and more harmony than unison.

### ■ 5. Future sound of synthesizer

Barney Worrell's Minimoog brought "cosmic electronic sounds" to black music for the first time.
**The origin of hip-hop, G-funk, and electro**.

## Conclusion: P-Funk is a "huge archive of black futures"

George Clinton is more than just a funk leader.
He was a "cultural architect" who brought together **music, the body, the universe, mythology, and social criticism**.

P-Funk's worldview is still alive today as the foundation of current hip-hop, R&B, electro art, and fashion.
As long as P-Funk remains at the center of black music that speaks to the future, their spaceship "Mothership" will never land.
