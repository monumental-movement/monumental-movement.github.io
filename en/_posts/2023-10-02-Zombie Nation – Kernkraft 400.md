---


"Kernkraft 400" (German: Kernkraft 400) is a song released by the German techno group Zombie Nation, and is the first single released from their album "Leichenschmaus". Released in 1999, it peaked at number 22 in Germany in February 2000. It reached the top 10 in Belgium and the Netherlands, and debuted at number 2 in the UK, selling over 400,000 copies and receiving a gold disc certification from the British Recording Industry Association.

The song is widely used as a cheering song at sports stadiums around the world (baseball, basketball, American football, ice hockey, etc.), and was ranked 8th on Sports Illustrated's 2014 Top 10 Stadium Anthems list. In Japan, it became widely known after Yokohama DeNA BayStars pitcher Yasuaki Yamazaki used it as the song when he took the mound, and because Rui Hachimura of the Japanese national basketball team was rooting for the famous Gonzaga University team, where he was a member at the time.
