## Prologue: On the island of the sound of waves and shochu


Text: mmr｜Theme: An experiment carried out on Amami Oshima to encourage the aging of shochu by making it listen to music. Exploring its scientific basis and cultural background


Amami Oshima, the farthest point of the Nansei Islands.
On this island, brown sugar shochu is surrounded by the sun and sea breeze, and people are quietly ""listening'' to music.
At night, the faint sounds of classical music, jazz, and island songs flow from the depths of the storage room, and alcohol molecules tremble inside the stainless steel tank.
They say that the sound makes the shochu softer.

This is not just a romantic metaphor. The phenomenon that physical vibrations caused by sound waves aids in ripening and brings out the flavor is currently attracting attention.
In this article, we will take a look at the whole picture of the ""acoustically aged shochu'' that brewers in Amami Oshima are trying to create, from both scientific and cultural perspectives.

## Chapter 1: The origin of Amami brown sugar shochu

Amami Oshima's shochu culture dates back to the late Edo period.
On this island, where sugar cane cultivation was popular, a unique distilled spirit made from molasses from pomace was born - **brown sugar shochu**.

In 1949 (Showa 24), when the Amami Islands were returned to Japan, a special exemption was granted for ""brown sugar shochu'' as defined by the National Tax Agency.
This is the only shochu standard that allows the combination of brown sugar and rice malt, and has become a cultural heritage exclusive to the Amami Islands.

> "Brown sugar shochu is made from Amami's soil, water, and wind."
> —— From an interview with the brewer of Amami Oshima Kaiun Sake Brewery

A soft texture created by the minerality of brown sugar and the soft water of the island.
It wasn't until the beginning of the 21st century that the idea of ​​using sound to enhance this natural blessing emerged.

## Chapter 2: Birth of alcohol that listens to sound

### ● Origin of idea
The impetus was the ""acoustic aging'' of wine that a wine brewer saw in Tokyo.
I learned about an attempt to speed up maturation by playing classical music,
He returned to Amami thinking, ""Maybe it could be done with shochu.''

In 2005, a certain warehouse on Amami Oshima installed acoustic speakers in its storage room for the first time.
The subjects tested were classical music (Bach, Mozart) and island songs (such as Satokuni Taka's ""Asahabushi'').
Six months later, the people involved who tasted it were surprised.
"Even though it's the same raw sake, it was more mellow when I listened to it."

### ● Mechanism of acoustic maturation
Sound waves cause minute vibrations inside the liquid.
Changing the frequency increases molecular collisions and accelerates the esterification reaction.
This is said to increase the aromatic components and reduce the irritation of alcohol.

> ""Bass waves move the liquid as deep bass waves, and high frequencies cause the surface layer to vibrate minutely.
> It's like receiving a sonic massage. "
> —— Researcher, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Food Science, Kagoshima University

## Chapter 3: Sounds played by Amami's storehouses

Each brewery in Amami Oshima has a different "style of sound."

| Brewery name | Music used | Effects/features | Sound equipment |
|------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Amami Oshima Kaiun Sake Brewery | Island songs, drums, sanshin | Increased sweetness and richness | Underwater transducer |
| Amami Brown Sugar Sake Brewery | Jazz (Miles Davis) | Alleviates bitterness | Wooden barrel speaker |
| Amami Oshima Sake Brewery | Classic (Mozart, Bach) | Gorgeous aroma | Ultrasonic vibration plate |
| Sato no Akebono (Machida Sake Brewery) | Natural sounds (waves, wind, birds) | Soft texture | Constant temperature storage + built-in speaker |

Each brewery has its own unique ""listening time.''
Most breweries play the sound at night, but some breweries play the sound throughout the fermentation process.
In particular, ""taiko and sanshin'' are rich in low frequencies and have high transmission efficiency to liquids.

---

## Chapter 4: "Taste of sound" seen through scientific eyes

Experimental data is also being accumulated.
According to a joint study by Kagoshima University,
Shochu that has undergone classical acoustic aging has a higher
**Average 8% reduction in aldehyde content**,
**Ester ratio increased by 12%**.

In addition, in sensory tests, the products were highly rated as ""rich in aroma" and ""not irritating."
The increase in molecular movement caused by sound wave stimulation is exactly what creates "taste tuning."

> "Shochu is alive. When you give it sound, it reacts as if it were breathing."
> —— Chief brewer/Kikaijima Sake Brewery Factory Manager

## Chapter 5: Fusion of acoustic maturity and Shimauta culture

For Amami, "sound" is not just background music.
Shimauta is the prayer of ancestors, a dialogue with nature, and the memory of a community.

The song that plays in the storage room is
It is also a labor song for sugarcane farmers who once crossed the ocean.
Although acoustic maturation is a scientific endeavor,
**It is also a ritual to engrave the memory of Amami into shochu**.

---

## Chapter 6: The taste of the future created by sound

Nowadays, sonic maturity is spreading beyond Amami.
Experiments are progressing with Iki shochu in Nagasaki and barley shochu in Fukuoka.
It has also spread to the world of wine, sake, and whisky.

In the future, there may come a time when aging will be controlled by "sound design" generated by AI.
AI composes a shochu aging song,
Alcohol molecules dance to the rhythm——
That day is approaching.

## Chapter 7: Listening tongue, resonating heart

People can "hear" sounds through their sense of taste.
For example, it is known that bitterness is perceived to be weaker in a space where soft sounds are played.
In other words, sound and taste are connected in the brain.

The act of listening to the sound of Amami shochu is
It"s not just science, it"s also the reunification of humans and nature.
The sound of the wind, the sound of waves, the sound of singing, and the sound of fermentation.
They become one harmony,
A small universe is playing inside the glass.

## Chapter 8: Comparison of acoustic experimental data

Acoustic maturation makes a difference not only in sensory impressions but also in scientific data.
The graph below is visualized based on Kagoshima University joint research (2023) and experimental data from four Amami Oshima breweries.

## Chapter 9: Amami brown sugar shochu map (location of warehouses and acoustic aging)

In the Amami Islands, there are **10 breweries** of brown sugar shochu, both large and small.
Among them, **4 breweries have introduced acoustic aging technology**, and all of them have their own unique "sound" as part of their brand.

## Chapter 10: Diversity of flavors created by sounds and terrain

Amami's topography stretches 160km from north to south, and the humidity, wind direction, and acoustic characteristics of the coastline vary from region to region.
For example, a storehouse facing Tatsugo Bay takes advantage of the sound of waves.
Warehouses located in mountainous areas create a maturing environment that takes advantage of natural reverberations.

Acoustic maturation is not just a "device";
**This is the "resonance of the island" where the topography itself becomes an instrument**.

> "Amami is an island like one giant speaker.
>The wind plays a low pitch, the waves play a medium pitch, and the voices of insects play a high pitch. "
> —— Machida Sake Brewery・Torji talk

## Conclusion: Poetry of sound and fermentation

When I passed in front of the Amami storehouse at night,
A faint sound of sanshin flows from the speakers.
Inside, brown sugar shochu is sleeping quietly.
I'm listening to that melody.

Time and sound slowly refine the taste.
"Maturity of sound" created by Amami"s climate and human wisdom——
It is another kind of music played by the island.
