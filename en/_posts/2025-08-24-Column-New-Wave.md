## New Wave is not just a genre, but a ""sensibility of the times'' that inherits the experimental spirit of the post-punk era and fuses diverse music and cultures.**

Text: mmr｜Theme: Art movements in the post-punk era

### From post-punk to new wave

The punk movement of 1976 shook up the music scene with its directness of being ""simple, fast, and anti-establishment.'' However, its explosive power was short-lived, and as punk became increasingly commercialized, many artists sought musical expansion while maintaining the ""punk spirit.''

The general term that was born from this experiment was ""New Wave.'' From an academic perspective, new wave is a concept that encompasses a variety of musical developments since post-punk, and rather than a strict genre name, it is a cultural label that refers to the consciousness and sensibilities of the times.

### Musical features and innovations

The musical characteristics of new wave can be organized into the following elements:

- **Rise of the synthesizer**

With the spread of analog synths and drum machines, mechanical and futuristic sounds were created. Gary Numan and Ultravox are prime examples.

- **Cross-genre**

They freely incorporated funk rhythms (Talking Heads), reggae grooves (The Police), and disco dance feel (Blondie), transcending genre boundaries.

- **Coexistence of pop and experiment**

While Joy Division and The Cure pursued a dark, experimental sound, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet aimed for a flashy, catchy pop style.

- **Social Criticism and Irony**

The lyrics reflected the alienation of urban life, Cold War anxieties, and satire on technological society. Devo's sarcastic performance is a symbol of this.

From a musical perspective, new wave can be seen as a movement based on the triadic simplicity of punk, with the expansion of electronic sound and the intelligence of art rock.

### Fashion and subculture

New Wave was not only a movement in music, but also in visual culture.

- **The advent of MTV (1981)**

Music videos became the focus of promotion, and bands like Duran Duran and A Flock of Seagulls integrated visual aesthetics and music, making new wave a ""visual-sound fusion genre.''

- **Fashion**

While inheriting the DIY spirit of punk, neo-romanticism presented a gorgeous and androgynous fashion. Silk shirts, eyeliner, and bright colors were iconic. On the other hand, the synth pop group created a ""cold urban atmosphere'' with monochrome futuristic costumes.

- **Relationship with art**

New York's Talking Heads is centered around art school graduate David Byrne, and incorporates influences from minimal art and conceptual art. In the UK, Vivienne Westwood's fashion and post-pop art design sensibilities are directly connected.

### Social and geopolitical context

The diversity of the new wave is deeply tied to the social context in which it was born.

- **UK**: Economic crisis in the late 1970s, rising unemployment rate under Thatcher administration. Young people felt a ""feeling of stagnation with no tomorrow,'' and they projected this into music and fashion.

- **America**: Linked to the New York art scene (CBGB, Mudd Club), it spread as intellectual experimental music after punk.

- **Japan**: Against the backdrop of high economic growth and advances in technology, "techno new wave" such as YMO and Plastics gained international recognition.

Against this background, new wave is not just a musical genre, but a reflection of urban culture and generational consciousness during the Cold War.

### Decline and Succession

From the mid-1980s onward, New Wave gradually became pop-oriented and commercialized, and was absorbed into popular culture by combining it with MTV-like image strategies.

But the spirit was passed on to the next generation:

- **Alternative Rock** (R.E.M., The Smiths, later Nirvana)

- **Synthpop/Electropop** (after Depeche Mode, modern CHVRCHES, Grimes)

- **Post-punk revival** (2000's Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, The Strokes)

New Wave was a major turning point in music history in that it ""crossed genre boundaries and elevated music to a cultural movement.''

<hr>

### Post-punk era art movement, not a genre

New wave originated from punk in the 1970s, and was an important movement in music history that incorporated electronic technology, crossed genres, and was socially critical. At the same time, it was an overall cultural movement that symbolized 1980s urban culture, involving fashion, video, art, and lifestyle.

New Wave is a ""comprehensive art of the era'' in which music, art, social criticism, and fashion are intricately intertwined.
