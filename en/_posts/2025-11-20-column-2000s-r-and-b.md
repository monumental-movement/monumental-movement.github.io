Diversifying subgenres, advances in production technology, the shrinking and digitalization of the music industry, and the birth of global stars. As these factors overlapped, R&B expanded like never before.

# 13. Summary: 2000s R&B as a bridge to the 2010s

2000s R&B played an important role in music history in the following ways:

* Birth of a global star (Beyoncé, Usher, Rihanna, etc.)
* Establishment of an era in which producers and technology take control of music
* Centering pop culture through fusion with hip-hop
* Transformation of production and distribution through digitalization
* A bridge to 2010s alternative R&B (Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, etc.)

The 2000s R&B was not only a "golden age" but also a "period of change."
Tradition and innovation, soul and electronic sounds, artists and producers, analog and digital.
Over the past 10 years, they have continued to dynamically transcend these boundaries, becoming the foundation of today's global music.
