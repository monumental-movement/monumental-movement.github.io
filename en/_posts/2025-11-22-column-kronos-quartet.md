## 2. From formation to early activities (1973–1980s)

Since its inception in San Francisco, the Kronos Quartet has been exploring a performance style outside of the traditional framework of classical music. Founder David Harris studied classical music at the University of California, Berkeley, and then became active in the San Francisco music scene, forming a quartet with like-minded friends.

In addition to baroque and classical works, the early repertoire included new works by contemporary composers. Their debut album, ""Kronos Quartet,'' released in 1976, was highly praised by critics for its combination of the esoteric nature of contemporary music and the high level of performance technique. During this period, they performed throughout the United States, mainly in San Francisco, and built a reputation as an innovative quartet.

### Major albums (early)

* **Kronos Quartet (1976)**: Debut album. Contains mainly works by contemporary composers.
* **White Man Sleeps (1988)**: An early attempt to incorporate elements of world folk music.

## 3. Challenge to modern music (1980s–1990s)

In the 1980s, the Kronos Quartet became an important presence in the American contemporary music world. The Kronos Quartet began collaborating with contemporary music masters such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley, and through performing and recording their works, the Kronos Quartet gained worldwide acclaim.

This period was characterized by **innovations in performance techniques**. In addition to traditional playing techniques for string instruments, studio work has increased, using electronics, introducing rhythms and scales from non-Western music, and making full use of sampling and multi-track recording.

### Major albums (contemporary music period)

* **Terry Riley: Kronos Quartet Plays Terry Riley (1989)**: Includes modern music masterpieces ""Sun Rings" and ""Cadenza." Expressing the charm of minimal music with a string quartet.
* **Black Angels (1990)**: Organized mainly around the works of George Crumb. Avant-garde expression stands out.

## 4. Cross-genre/Crossover (1990s–2000s)

From the 1990s to the 2000s, the Kronos Quartet began to move beyond the boundaries of classical music, merging with genres such as world music, pop, film music, and jazz.

Innovation in film music is particularly notable with the film ""Requiem for a Dream" released in 2000. Composed by Clint Mansell, performed by Kronos Quartet. The string quartet"s ""Lux Aeterna" and other pieces were overwhelmingly effective in their repetitive motive, building tension, and amplifying emotion, all of which are linked to the film"s psychological portrayal.

### Movie Soundtrack Features

* **Arrangement**: 2 violins, 1 viola, 1 cello
* **Performance Technique**:

* Repeated short motifs (rhythmic repetition)
* Feeling of tension due to sudden changes in dynamics
* Continuous use of crescendo and diminuendo by string instruments
* **Technical innovation**:

* Applying minimal music techniques to film music
* Frequent use of detailed articulations (staccato, spiccato, portamento)
* Achieves a thicker sound image by overlapping multi-track recording.
