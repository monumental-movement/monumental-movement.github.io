  horizon of a new generation of samba soul revealed by Clareia and its remix'

## **Introduction**

Text: mmr｜Theme: How Brazilian music has evolved and been reconnected since the 21st century, centering on the musical history of Sabrina Mallheiros, her relationship with Azimuth, the evolution of her work, and the symbolism of "Clareia."


As Brazilian music continues to be reevaluated around the world, Sabrina Mallheiros is the person who has flexibly combined the sensibilities of samba soul, funk, bossa nova, and neo-soul. A descendant of Azimuth, led by Aza Mallheiros, they have been enthusiastically supported by music communities in London, Japan, and Europe.

In particular, her 2017 album **Clareia** was the moment when her musical world blossomed most clearly.
Its title track **"Clareia"** later found new life in the underground dance community, spawning remixes by key figures in UK jazz/broken beat including **Henry Wu (Kamaal Williams)**, **2000 Black (Dego & Kaidi)** and **IG Culture**.

## **1. Early life and influence of Azimuth**

Sabrina Mallheiros is from Rio de Janeiro.
His father is **Alex Malheiros**, the bassist for Azimuth (later also known as Azymuth). Azimuth's music, which she has been exposed to since childhood, freely moves between funk, jazz, samba, and fusion.

Azimuth has been popular worldwide since the 1970s, and has been sampled by a wide range of artists from club jazz, future jazz, house, and hip-hop. The ""floating feeling", ""soft groove", and ""cosmic chord feeling"' of live performance are strongly inherited by Sabrina"s works.

However, Sabrina's music is not a direct imitation of her father, but has a strong sense of ""elegance as a female vocalist" and ""urban soul." While taking the rhythmic suppleness of Azimuth as their DNA, they have transformed it into a more lyrical and soft texture.

## **2. Early works: Signs of a new generation of samba soul**

### ● **"Equilibria" (2005)**

In this debut work, the combination of Sabrina's "transparent singing voice" and "modern beat" was already established. While interweaving samba, MPB, and soul, he presents a texture that blurs the boundaries between acoustic and electric.

### ● **"New Morning" (2011)**

This album has a stronger tone of jazz-funk and urban soul, and strongly appealed to club listeners. It became particularly popular in the European club jazz community, and gained support from DJs in London.

Since her debut, Sabrina has consistently aimed for a "coexistence of Brazilian tradition and modern beats," but in the late 2010s, she significantly deepened her direction.

## **3. "Clareia" (2017): Sound image illuminated by light**

### ● Overall picture of the album

""Clareia" has the meaning of ""to brighten" and ""to illuminate.'' Just as the title suggests, the entire album is full of sunlight-like clarity and soft grooves.

There are moments of mellow jazz-funk that give you a direct feel of Azimuth"s bloodline, while MPB"s sophisticated melodies, beautiful strings, and light percussion are exquisitely combined.

### ● Title song "Clareia"

This song, which can be said to be a symbol of the album, combines Sabrina's soft singing voice, dynamic percussion, and flowing lines of the keyboard to create a clear texture of light.

"Clareia" attracted attention in the European jazz/club world from the time it was released, leading to a later remix project.

## **4. "Clareia" remix**

### - Bridge with the UK created by Henry Wu, 2000 Black, IG Culture -**

The enthusiasm that Sabrina's music received from the UK scene can be said to be a symbol of the "new reappraisal of Brazilians" in the late 2010s.
In particular, the remix of "Clareia" by the following three groups that formed the jazz/broken beat movement in London is important.

---

### **● Henry Wu (Kamaal Williams) Remix**

Henry Wu was a central figure in the South London jazz revival movement, also known as Yussef Kamaal.

His remix emphasizes complex drum work in the vein of broken beat and the sophistication of electric jazz. While maintaining the "light" of the original song, by adding a London-like urban feel, it has a more club-friendly finish.

・Bouncing beat
・Soft Rhodes
・Baseline with emphasis on syncopation

As a result, "Clareia" has acquired a new look that blends naturally on London's dance floors.

### **● 2000 Black (Dego & Kaidi) Remix**

2000 Black, by Dego and Kaidi Tatham, is known as one of broken beat's most important labels and projects.

The 2000 Black version of "Clareia" is composed of a more driving broken beat and a thick bass line, creating a beautiful contrast with Sabrina"s singing voice. While inheriting the "fluid chord progression" that can be called Azimuth"s style, it is reinterpreted with the futuristic funk feel unique to 2000 Black.

The feel is exactly
**"Brazilian Future Soul"**
worthy of being called.

### **● IG Culture Remix**

IG Culture is a London broken beat legend whose musical and cultural influence is immeasurable.

The IG Culture version of "Clareia" has a rhythm with a lower center of gravity and a strong soulful and street-like feel.
The beat is not rough, but rather smooth, creating a deep sound image that envelops Sabrina's singing voice.

It can be said to be the most "underground" finish with a strong black texture.

## **5. UK Jazz ~ Resonance with broken beat**

It"s easy to see why Sabrina"s songs resonated so strongly with UK artists.

* Azimuth ~ A "swaying" groove that leads to Brazilian music
* Jazz language and soft chord work
* Affinity with Soul/Neo Soul
* Light rhythm that fits the structure of club music

Sabrina"s music inherently had elements that fit naturally into the two contexts of London"s jazz movement and broken beat.

For this reason, the remix group of "Clareia" was acclaimed worldwide as a new bridge between "Brazil x UK".

Sabrina Malleiros' songs consistently exhibit the following characteristics:

### ● **Soft vocals and urban elegance**

The singing voice is light, the humidity is not too high, and it is urbane and sophisticated.

### ● **Mixture of jazz/funk/samba/soul**

While inheriting Azimuth's DNA, it also naturally connects with contemporary neo-soul and club music.

### ● **The boundary between acoustic and electric is blurred**

There's the warmth of live instruments and the clarity of modern beats at the same time.
