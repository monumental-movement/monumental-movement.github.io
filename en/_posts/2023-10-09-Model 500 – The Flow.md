title: Model 500 – The Flow
---


Model 500 is another name of Juan Atkins.

"THE FLOW" is a song that has undergone various remixes. Juan Atkins gives off a pure R&B vibe with his "G-Funk Mix."

The Alex Reece Mix, on the other hand, has a smooth jazz step remix, but the vocals aren't completely unified and feel a bit out of sync with the rhythm.

Underworld MK. 2 Mix is ​​a simple, club-friendly track with a dark and slightly aggressive feel. However, Frank De Wulf offers a remix that incorporates elements of tribal house, and the "Original Mix" still retains its shine.
