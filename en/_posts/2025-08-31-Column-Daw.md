## “An environment where everyone can deliver sound to the world”

Text: mmr｜Theme: A cultural device symbolizing the “democratization of music production”

DTM (DeskTop Music) - Called ``DTM'' in Japanese and DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) in English-speaking countries, the workflow refers to a culture in which recording, editing, mixing, and production are completed using computers and software.In this article, we will organize the flow from its emergence to the present, along with a chronology, with a focus on "technological turning points" and "cultural impact."

<hr>

### Trend by era

**1940–1960s**: Era of tape and multitrack recording
Techniques for "cutting and pasting" sound developed, such as tape editing, tape looping, and musique concrète.Overdub recording in studios became popular.

**1970s**: Synthesizers and early computer music
Instruments such as analog synths and the Minimoog spread, and electronic music production methods diversify.

**Around 1983**: The appearance of the MIDI standard (standardized data communication between musical instruments) → revolutionized the production workflow.

**Late 1980s – Early 1990s**: Early digital editing/sequencer + hardware era
Introducing samplers, hardware sequencers, and early computer-based music software.The advent of professional digital recording systems.

**Mid-Late 1990s**: Professionalization of Pro Tools and digital recording
High-performance recording systems that rely on hardware have become widespread, and post-production and recording are rapidly becoming digital.Plug-in standards such as VST have also been established.

**2000s**: Computer-based DAWs became mainstream and home studios exploded.
Lower prices and improved plug-in quality have made it possible for individuals to create professional-quality products.Loop culture, combined with the expansion of online distribution.

**2010s**: DAW diversification and live/improvisation-oriented (Ableton, etc.)
Introducing non-linear editing, clip-based live music integration, cloud and collaboration tools.

**2020s**: AI-assisted production, cloud collaboration, further democratization
Automatic mixing/mastering, generation AI, cloud project sharing, etc. are affecting the production flow.

### Origin and early days (tape to analog era)

The origin of DTM is the act itself of ``creating a work by recording and editing sound.''Experiments with physical media, such as tape editing (cutting and pasting), tape looping (creating repeated sounds), tape reversing, and speed manipulation, shaped electronic music in the mid-20th century.This was an era where large studio equipment and skilled engineers were the focus.

<hr>

### Revolution brought about by the advent of MIDI (around 1983)

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a standard for exchanging note information and control information between keyboards, sequencers, and computers.This made production by integrating synthesizers and external modules much easier, and made software sequence control (later the core of DAWs) a reality.MIDI standardizes "performance information" and dramatically increases the flexibility of music production.

<hr>

### The Rise of Computers and Software (1990s)

Improvements in computer performance and the practical use of hard disk recording have made it possible to edit audio waveforms digitally.Avid's Pro Tools (then Digidesign) digitally enabled professional recording and editing workflows and became the industry standard for film, broadcast, and music production.At the same time, software sequencers/comprehensive DAWs such as Steinberg's Cubase and Emagic's Logic (later acquired by Apple) became popular.Furthermore, the VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plug-in proposed by Steinberg expanded the ecosystem by providing a mechanism for third parties to develop software sound sources and effects.

<hr>

### Birth of home studios and “individual production” (2000s)

With improvements in the performance of personal PCs, the spread of audio interfaces, and improvements in the quality of plug-ins, recording is no longer just for the studio.Production environments centered around loops and patterns, such as FL Studio and Ableton Live, have changed the production style of electronic music and hip-hop, and it has become common for individuals to complete albums and soundtracks at home.With the combination of Internet distribution and sales platforms (Bandcamp, SoundCloud, etc.), the threshold from production to release has dropped dramatically.

<hr>

### 2010s and beyond: Diversification, improvisation, and cloud computing

DAWs have evolved from tools for simply "recording, arranging, and mixing" to multifunctional features such as live performance (Ableton Live), real-time collaboration, video linkage, and modular integration.Usage options are further expanding, including mobile apps/DAWs for iPad, cloud project synchronization, and the introduction of subscription models.

<hr>

### Technical key elements (what supports the DAW)

**Audio interface**: The quality of AD/DA conversion and low latency (delay) determine the comfort of production.

**MIDI**: Recording/editing performance information.We will also keep an eye on the evolution of standards such as MIDI CC and MIDI 2.0 (which is gradually becoming popular).

**Plug-ins (VST/AU/AAX, etc.)**: Expand functionality by adding soft sound sources and effects.

**Sampling and Samplers**: An important tool in sound design.Sampler culture is the foundation of hip-hop and electronica.

**Time stretch/pitch correction**: Freely manipulate the length and pitch of sounds (e.g. audio quantization, pitch correction tools).

**Automation and Modulation**: Achieve dynamism by changing parameters over time.

**Non-destructive editing**: Can be edited without changing the original data.Basic functions of DAW.

### Changes in cultural aspects and industrial structure

**Democratization**: Lower production costs have made it possible for a variety of artists to participate.Indie/home production has become the norm.

**Collaboration**: International collaboration and file exchange via the internet is expanding.Boundaries are solved.

**Changes in commercial models**: Direct sales through self-produced products, software usage through subscriptions, and expansion of the plug-in market.

**Learning and Community**: The democratization of learning is progressing through know-how sharing on YouTube and forums.

<hr>

### Current trends and near future

**Introduction of AI**: AI tools are beginning to take over some of the work, such as songwriting assistance, mix correction, and mastering automation.There is a possibility that the role of tools will shift from "assistance" to "co-creator."

**Cloud/Collaboration**: Online synchronization and real-time collaborative editing of DAW projects is increasing.

**Modular integration/hybrid workflow: **Fusion of software and hardware (outboard, modular).While hardware equipment is being reproduced with software, there is also a strong movement to seek the presence of hardware.

**Live and Interactive**: The application of DAWs is expanding not only to music but also to multimedia and interactive experience creation.

<hr>

### Practical advice (for those who are about to start DTM)

Clarify your purpose (track production, band recording, live performance, sound design, etc.).The choice of DAW is determined by the purpose.

The basics are a sense of sound creation and arrangement.Musical trial and error and ear training are more important than expensive equipment.

Plugins are tools.After understanding the basics of EQ, compression, and reverb, move on to special effects.

Solidify your workflow.Get into the habit of using templates and shortcuts to save time.

Backup and version control.Save projects frequently and use cloud synchronization.

<hr>

### Mini dictionary of terms

**DAW**: Digital Audio Workstation.Software for recording, editing, mixing, and producing audio.

**MIDI**: Digital standard for representing performance information (notes, velocity, controls).

**VST/AU/AAX**: Plug-in standards (third-party sound sources/effects).

**Audio interface**: A device that connects a PC to a microphone/instrument (performs AD/DA conversion).

**Sampling**: A technique that uses existing sound sources as materials.

### What is DTM? — Co-evolution of technology and culture

DTM/DAW is not just a collection of tools, but a cultural device that symbolizes the ``democratization of music production.''From the days of tape editing and hardware synths, to MIDI and digital recording, to VST and plug-in ecosystems, to AI and the cloud, technology has lowered the barriers to expression and created an environment where anyone can deliver sound to the world.

Technology will continue to evolve, but at the core is the creator's intention: ``What kind of sound should we make and why?''By fully utilizing technology as a tool, new musical expressions will continue to be born.
