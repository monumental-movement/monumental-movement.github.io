### ■ Representative success example: "Cowboy Bebop"

Director Shinichiro Watanabe's ""Cowboy Bebop,'' which aired in 1998, is a monumental work that showed the world the affinity between anime and jazz.
The music was composed by The Seatbelts, a band led by Yoko Kanno. Using everything from big band jazz to scat and fusion-like guitar solos, he depicted the story world of the anime as ""music itself.''

The opening song ""Tank!" had a big band sound reminiscent of a spy movie, but it also had an ""adult coolness" that was unusual for an anime opening song at the time, captivating fans all over the world.
Since this success, jazz has often been referred to as a symbol of coolness and urbanity in anime.

### ■ Daily life anime and jazz

On the other hand, jazz is not just "urban".
Cafes, street corners on rainy days, calm afternoons - it is often used as background music to brighten up casual everyday life.

For example, "Apollo on the Slope" (2012). The original manga uses jazz itself as its theme, but the sounds of the sessions that echo in the city of Nagasaki, where the story is set, support the fluctuations of daily life and youth with the improvisational nature unique to jazz.
In addition, although ""Nodame Cantabile'' focuses on classical music, swing and light jazz-style arrangements are inserted into everyday scenes, highlighting the free-spirited nature of the characters.

### ■ Scenes where jazz/fusion suits you

Fast-paced battles and chases → Complex fusion drums and bass lines double the rhythm of the video.

Scenes of city nights and bars → The tones of the saxophone and piano create a ""adult atmosphere.''

Comical dialogue → Emphasize the tempo with light swing jazz.

Quiet psychological depiction and lingering sound → The faint sounds of cool jazz and mode jazz are effective.

### ■ "LAZARUS" and the jazz spirit

"LAZARUS", which was broadcast in the spring of 2025, is a science fiction anime created by director Shinichiro Watanabe, MAPPA, and Kamasi Washington.
Themes such as "death and rebirth," "time limits," and "salvation of humanity" resonate with the "improvisational reconstruction of life" that is inherent in jazz.
In particular, Kamasi Washington's spiritual jazz echoes the motif of ""Lazarus = resurrection'' in multiple layers throughout the story.

### ■ Summary

Jazz/fusion brings urbanity and improvisation to anime, and sometimes symbolizes the ""life and death" and ""destruction and rebirth" of the entire story.
The stylishness of ""Lupin the Third", the stylishness of ""Cowboy Bebop", the youthful passion of ""Apollo on the Slope", and the sci-fi scale of ""LAZARUS"──
All of these are extensions of jazz's ""free and regenerative spirit.''

And as the name "Lazarus" suggests, jazz is constantly revived in new forms and continues to be closely linked to the world of anime.
