  "hybrid 80s" reorganized by acoustic demolitionists'
---



## Why did you choose the title "Deconstruction of the 80s"?

A long column that uses only facts to analyze the "acoustic deconstruction and reconstruction" that Bill Laswell practiced in the 1980s. About Material, Herbie Hancock's "Future Shock," Last Exit, connecting to world music, and more.


Bill Laswell's musical activities in the 1980s were a series of ""deconstructions and reconstructions,'' freely crossing genres, cultures, performance forms, and national borders.
Funk, hip-hop, Afrobeat, world music, free jazz, noise... Laswell's projects in the 1980s are so diverse that each one is a sound generated within a different network.

Because of his diversity, it was not easy to get a bird's-eye view of his activities at the time. Because individual works were fragmented and scattered, listeners were unable to grasp the ""whole picture.''

However, with the compilation album Deconstruction of the 80s, things changed completely. This album is a compilation of the multi-genre and multi-project sound sources that Laswell was involved in in the 1980s, remastered and reconstructed.
In other words, it can be said that this compilation itself appeared as a ""completed form of deconstruction and reconstruction.''

This article focuses on the recordings of this album and projects from that time, and follows the facts of how Bill Laswell & Friends deconstructed and reorganized the acoustics of the 1980s.
By looking at the whole picture, we can for the first time understand the meaning of the phrase "Deconstruction of the 80s" from both a sonic and cultural perspective.

## Introduction: Why "deconstructing the 80s"
When talking about the music history of the 1980s, Bill Laswell is always on the other side.
Behind the flashy sounds of major pop, he was a ""sound editor'' who reorganized black music, noise, traditional African music, dub, avant-garde, and studio technology, and traversed a variety of fields as a producer, bassist, and conductor.

The reason why Laswell deserves to be called ""Deconstruction of the 1980s'' lies in the following facts.

- His activities were a "crossroads" bridging pop and underground
- The produced works are parallelized across the boundaries of world music, jazz, and noise.
- Breaking the 80's sound formula and turning the studio into a testing ground
- The released works have blurred the genre definition.

In this article, we introduce Bill Laswell and the musicians around him.
**How ​​the acoustics of the 1980s were "deconstructed and reorganized"** will be tracked based on facts.
