## 1. Redefining the concept of genre

Text: mmr｜Theme: Formation of immersive experience through acoustics, space, and ritual structure

Dark Ambient is not a semantic extension of ambient music, but a sonic expression created by intentionally reducing musical elements.

The identifying elements of music, such as meter, melody, and instrumentality, recede, and the following are foregrounded:

* Sustained sound
* Frequency band imbalance
* Spatial reverberation
*Unknown sound source

Ritual Ambient is distinct in that it uses this Dark Ambient-like method while introducing a clear "progressive structure." Ritualism is not established through symbols, but through the design of the arrangement of sounds and their duration.

## 2. Experimental background before formation

From the late 1970s to the 1980s, people around industrial music experimented with ""stopping music's functions.''

* Use of factory sounds, medical sounds, and environmental sounds
* Frequency design with discomfort in mind
* Refusal to repeat or expand

These attempts resulted in ""music that cannot be heard,'' and laid the groundwork for the immersive sound that later Dark Ambient aimed for.

---

## 3. Establishment of Dark Ambient by Lustmord

Lustmord was the first artist to define Dark Ambient as an ""sound space" rather than an ""atmosphere."

The characteristics of his production can be summarized as follows.

* Field recording in a huge real space
* Sustained use of ultra-low frequencies
* Processing that intentionally hides the source of the sound
* Configuration without expansion

Through this methodology, music is presented as a state of being rather than a progression over time.

## 4. Lustmord acoustic design details

### 4.1 Frequency band imbalance

The design, centered around the lower limit of the audible range, creates a perception accompanied by a physical sensation of vibration.

### 4.2 Handling spatial recording

Materials recorded in caves, underground facilities, and ruins are placed as the main components of the music, rather than just background sounds.

### 4.3 Suppressing effect processing

Reverb and delay are used not for direction, but for reconstructing the space itself.

["In Lustmord, acoustic processing is not a decoration, but a rearrangement of physical conditions."]

---

## 5. Relationship with video works

Lustmord's music plays the following roles in movies and video works:

* Do not induce emotions
* Does not explain narrative structure
* Exists as a layer equivalent to visual perception

This position became the standard for later Dark Ambient to distance itself from film music roles.

---

## 6. Background of the establishment of Ritual Ambient

In the 1990s, Dark Ambient's works with explicit religious and ritual references increased.

Ritual Ambient combines the following elements:

*Reference to the structure of liturgical music
* Vocal material whose linguistic meaning has been retracted
* Fixation of consciousness through repetition

---

## 7. Positioning of Raison d"être

Raison d"être established Ritual Ambient as a "system" rather than an individual work.

His production is distinctive in that rather than expressing religious themes emotionally, he transforms them into sonic structures.

---

## 8. Analysis of the production process of Raison d"être

### 8.1 Album structure

Although all the songs are independent, they form a ritual flow depending on the order in which they are arranged.

### 8.2 Sound material selection

* Pipe organ sound
* Bell harmonics
* Low range chorus

### 8.3 Mixing philosophy

Avoid extreme localization changes and maintain a centrally focused sound image.

["Raison d"être"s music is designed to transform the listening space into a virtual sanctuary."]

## 10. Music and architectural acoustics

Both genres are closely related to architectural acoustics.

* church
* Underground space
* Stone architecture

These reverberation characteristics are reflected in the composition of the song itself.

---

## 11. Application to video field

Dark Ambient / Ritual Ambient has been used in the following areas:

* Experimental film
* Museum installation
* Game environment sounds

What they have in common is that sound does not provide explanations.

---

## 12. Changes in production techniques

### Analog period

* Tape operation
* Real space recording
* Physics editing

### Digital era

*Layer management by DAW
* Impulse response
* Non-linear editing

---

## 13. Points to note in contemporary production

* Excessive number of sounds hinders immersion
* Deployment can be structurally destructive
* Sound pressure competition is not essential

---

## 14. Chronology

### 1980s

*Environmental acoustic experiment from Industrial
* Dark Ambient establishment by Lustmord

### 1990s

*Dark Ambient genre recognition
* Ritual Ambient systemization by Raison d"être

### Since 2000s

* Establishment in the video/installation field

---

## 15. Genre Current Location

Dark Ambient / Ritual Ambient is not a trend, but continues to exist as a purpose-specific sound.

Although the number produced is limited, it maintains its value as a reference point.

["This genre is defined by persistence, not expansion."]

---

## 16. Conclusion

Lustmord and Raison d"être are the reference points that established the Dark Ambient / Ritual Ambient methodology.

Their influence is not musical imitation;

* Space design
* Perceptual manipulation
* Structural arrangement

It has been inherited as.

Dark Ambient / Ritual Ambient is one of the few sonic forms that shows that music can be "presence" rather than "progression."
