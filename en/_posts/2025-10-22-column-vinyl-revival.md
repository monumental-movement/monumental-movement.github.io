## Chapter 2: "Resurrection of rituals" told by numbers

Economic data may seem cold, but it is also a mirror reflecting the heat of culture.
The increase in record sales is not just about nostalgia;
It is a symbol of the new consumer behavior of "buying experiences."

In particular, many of the Gen Z buyers are the "digital generation" themselves.
For them, records function as ""unknown classics'' - a new narrative device.

## Chapter 3: Media Archeology and the Psychology of Ownership

Behind the transparency of digital, the materiality of analog shines once again.
Music recording media do more than just store information.
It is a medium that visualizes human concepts such as "time," "deterioration," and "memory."

The ring of records symbolizes the cycle of time.
It is a metaphor for "music" itself,
"The act of listening is a ritual of reuniting with time."

## Chapter 4: Effects of records on the brain

According to research in psychology and brain science,
The human brain feels pleasure in sounds that have "fluctuations".
Fine noise and fluctuations contained in analog sound are
Resonating with the natural phenomenon called 1/f fluctuation,
It has the effect of calming the rhythm of heartbeat and brain waves.

──In other words, listening to records is also an act of ""conditioning the autonomic nervous system of the mind.''

## Chapter 5: Future analog ─ Reaction in the AI ​​era

In an era where AI can generate music infinitely,
"Sounds that cannot be reproduced" and "trace of matter" are
Paradoxically, it is beginning to acquire scarcity value.

Records in the era of AI-generated music
**It will continue to be an "anti-algorithmic entity"**.

### Conclusion: The future inside a rotating disk

We live in an age where data is at its peak, and algorithms control everything.
Under these circumstances, people are once again seeking "material sound."

Records never die.
Rather, as a symbol of the rotation of human memory and emotions,
It continues to quietly and surely turn to the future.
