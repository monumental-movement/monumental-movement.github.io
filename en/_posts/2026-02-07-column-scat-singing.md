## Prologue Freedom born at the moment of abandoning meaning

Text: mmr｜Theme: The cultural history of the birth, spread, and renewal of scat singing, where the voice becomes rhythm and melody beyond words.

Scat singing is a vocal expression that temporarily distances itself from meaningful language and sings improvisationally using syllables and onomatopoeia. This method of treating the voice itself as an instrument through melody, rhythm, timbre, and phrasing has been much more than just a singing technique in the history of jazz. It was an act that updated the very questions ""What is a singer?" and ""What role does the voice play?"

In early 20th century America, jazz was a music that was supported by the body and memory rather than sheet music. Improvisation was not an ornament, but a practice at the heart of music. Scat is a natural outcome of this improvisational nature that extends to the voice. By temporarily abandoning words that convey meaning, singers were able to stand on the same level as performers.

Developments in recording technology were also important. In the process of moving from wax cylinders to shellac discs, improvisation changed from a one-time event to something that is repeatedly listened to, analyzed, and imitated. Scat was also an extremely modern form of expression, where momentary flashes of inspiration became fixed as history.

> When the voice was stripped of meaning, the freedom of improvisation rose fully for the first time.

## Chapter 1 Vocal improvisation as prehistory

Although it is difficult to pinpoint the direct origins of scat singing, its prehistory clearly exists. In musical cultures originating from Africa, the voice was not only a tool for communicating words, but also a physical act responsible for rhythm and pitch. The sense that meaningful language and meaningless vocalizations coexist in the same space was deeply rooted in call-and-response and ritual music.

In the work songs and field horrors sung on plantations in the American South, elongated vowels and improvised screams formed the rhythm of labor. These vocalizations were more like movement than melodies, and the voice functioned as an extension of the body.

In early 20th century vaudeville and music halls, it was common to sing with many meaningless syllables to attract the attention of the audience. Even in the early jazz vocal recordings that remain, the habit of breaking the endings of words and elongating syllables can be seen. These were the germs of the sensibility that would later become formalized as scat.

> Scat was not a sudden invention, but the accumulation of a long practice of treating the voice as sound.

## Chapter 2 Louis Armstrong and the moment of formalization

In the mid-1920s, one-shot recording was the norm in recording studios in Chicago and New York. The performers had to complete several minutes perfectly at the same time as the signal to start recording. The tension of Louis Armstrong's scat is inseparable from this recording environment.

In his scat, the syllables have no meaning, but the rhythmic arrangement is very clear. The beginning of the phrase is the attack of the trumpet, and the ending naturally converges with the breath. Here the voice acts as a melodic instrument, and the absence of lyrics becomes a prerequisite rather than an omission.

If you listen carefully to records from that time, you"ll realize that the sense of distance between you and the band was also important. The scat doesn"t get lost in the accompaniment, but it doesn't stand out too much either. The sense of improvising within the ensemble had already been perfected.

> Armstrong did not transform the voice into an instrument; he proved that the voice is an instrument.

## Chapter 3 Swing Era and Refinement of Techniques

Big band recordings in the 1930s required singers to make a strong impression in a short time. Scat is an effective means of achieving this. When you listen to Ella Fitzgerald's recordings, you can hear that each syllable is precisely meshed with the rhythm section.

Although her scat has a clear melodic line, it always contains subtle fluctuations. It's as if the sense of time that swings back and forth, which is unique to swing, is visualized through the voice. In the recording, she seamlessly takes over the flow even when she enters immediately after an instrumental solo.

If we pseudo-transcribe one chorus of typical scat improvisation, we can see its structure. It begins with a light bouncing "ba-doo-la", followed by a short breath. The next bar breaks into syllables, "bop-ba-dee-ah," perfectly in sync with the drum's ride pattern. At the end of the phrase, lower the pitch and lengthen the vowels, landing naturally on the walking bass.

What is important is the placement rather than the syllables themselves. Breaths are always placed at rhythmic breaks, not at semantic breaks in phrases. The voice does not sing a melody, but plays time.

Cab Calloway's scat, on the other hand, was more of a stage extension than a studio. Exaggerated syllables, crowd-inducing pauses, and repeated phrases create a participatory musical experience. Immediacy is more important here than accuracy.

> Scat has grown into an expression that embraces both sophisticated technique and popular joy.

## Chapter 4 Bebop and vocal instrumentalization

Bebop recordings in the late 1940s had a tension similar to that of a live performance, even in the studio. The tempo is fast, the harmonies are complex, and there are always multiple improvisational options. Scat requires complete instrumental judgment here.

In Sarah Vaughan's recordings, the scat progresses as if threading inside the chords. The syllables are short and clear, as if your voice is following the voicings of the piano. Her jumps from low to high registers reveal no physical limitations to her voice.

Using bebop idioms vocally was an act that presupposed an understanding of improvisational theory. Here, scat moves one step from sensory expression to theoretical practice.

## Chapter 5 Modern Jazz and Introspection of Expression

After the 1950s, the recording environment gradually became more stable, and it became possible to record minute differences in expression. Scat has come to be about quality over quantity and density over speed.

On Chet Baker's recordings, the scatting is almost a whisper. There are few syllables, and the breath placed at the end of the phrase plays an important role. Even silence functions as part of the improvisation.

> Scat shifted its focus from extroverted technique to inner expression.

## Chapter 6 Free Jazz and the Deconstruction of Voices

In the 1960s, studios served as laboratories for free jazz recording. Singers are freed from melodies and chord progressions and explore the possibilities of their voices themselves.

One improvised take does not have a traditional chorus structure. The beginning begins with almost silent breaths, and gradually fricative sounds such as "ha" and "uh" are mixed in. There is no set tempo, and the voices appear intermittently in response to the flutter of the saxophone or the pounding of the drums.

Scat here is not a series of syllables, but a series of vocal acts themselves. The pitch is undefined, the vowels are distorted, and the breath invades the inside of the phrase. Through the recording, the voice emerges as a third entity that is neither a melodic instrument nor a percussion instrument.

> By being deconstructed, Scat rediscovered the primal power of the voice.

## Chapter 7 Scat as a syllabic vocabulary

Although the syllables used in scat may seem arbitrary, they actually have a certain functional tendency. Singers unconsciously select syllables that correspond to the way the instrument is played.

"ba", "bop", and "da", which contain plosive sounds, are often used in situations where you want to make the attack clear. These produce an effect similar to the tonguing of a trumpet or saxophone. On the other hand, syllables such as "doo," "loo," and "la" that are centered around flowing sounds and vowels are suitable for legato phrases and sustaining intervals.

The fricatives ""ske," ""sha," and ""tss"' often function as gaps or accents in the rhythm, and are highly compatible with drum hi-hats and brush playing. Scat"s vocabulary is chosen for its acoustic properties rather than its meaning.

> The scat syllables function not as words but as a performance technique.

## Chapter 8 Influences that extend beyond jazz

With further developments in recording technology, scat fragments have become subject to sampling and quotation. The voice is both a performance and a material, crossing genres.

Scat ideas have become widespread, from the light vocal improvisations of bossa nova to the fake singing of soul and funk, and even the chorus work of pop.

> Scat has transcended genres and continued to expand the freedom of voice.

## Supplementary chapter: Scat for Japanese speakers

The reason Japanese speakers find scat difficult is not so much the technique but the structure of the language. Japanese language is centered around vowels, with few consecutive consonants and clear breaks between syllables. As a result, detailed rhythmic expressions using plosives and fricatives are difficult to embody.

In addition, Japanese vocalizations have a strong connection between meaning and sound, and it is easy to feel psychological resistance to uttering meaningless syllables. Scat requires the courage not to say the syllable, and this feeling may be easier for non-native speakers to acquire.

Looking back at the history of Japanese jazz vocals, singing with lyrics was accepted from an early stage, while instrumental scatting was treated with caution. Behind this is the difference in language and culture.

> Learning scat begins not with vocal technique, but with updating one's view of language.

## Final Chapter A voice that continues to ring outside of meaning

The cultural history of scat singing is also a history of the possibilities of the voice. From language that carries meaning to pure materials that make up music. This shift shook the very values ​​of 20th century music.

As long as the act of improvisation exists, the voice once again steps outside of meaning. Scat is not a technique of the past, but is always an ongoing question.

> As long as the voice is released as sound, the history of scat will never end.
