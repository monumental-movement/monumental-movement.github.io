This is an EP by “Mystic Bill” Torres, also known as Billy Nightmare, who emerged from the Chicago rave scene.

Originally, the project was going to be titled "Billy's Nightmare," but to avoid a lifetime of bad luck, Torres decided to switch it up to Billy Nightmare, put aside his Mystic Bill alias, cut his hair, changed his sound, and assumed this new persona.

Reality Check contains four tracks recorded at Chicago's Mirage Studios in 1996.

The two tracks on side A have dark beats that cast a shadow over your head for a while. The B-side features two versions of the same song, both showing the versatility Mystic Bill is capable of producing.

All songs were remastered by George Horn at Fantasy Studios.
