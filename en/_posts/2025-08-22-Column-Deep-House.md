  the temperature of soul and jazz into house'

## First of all, what is deep house?


Text: mmr｜Theme: Deep House, a genre that continues to quietly evolve while incorporating history and context.

Deep house is a strain of house that emerged in the Chicago-New Jersey area in the late 1980s. Characterized by soul/jazz harmonies, smooth bass, and a restrained groove, it is a type of dance music that is ""deep, long, and warms the body'' rather than a rush peak. BPM is generally 118–124 (slow to medium speed), 7th/9th chords, electric piano (Rhodes), organ (Korg M1 series), and laid-back vocals are symbolic. It has a "night temperature" that is valid for both the floor and listening.

### Background and development of birth

**1985–90: Early Early (Chicago/NJ)**

[Larry Heard (Mr. Fingers)](https://amzn.to/4q97ot4) presents the prototype with "Can You Feel It" and "Mystery of Love." Following the flow of [Frankie Knuckles](https://amzn.to/4nUwWJ4) and [Marshall Jefferson](https://amzn.to/3KOf4AV), a fusion of Jersey Garage's sweet soul feel ([Blaze](https://amzn.to/4ooZuuc) and [Kerri Chandler](https://amzn.to/4qbd4CR)).

**1990s: Deepening and diversification**

Chicago"s [Ron Trent & Chez Damier (Prescription)](https://amzn.to/4nOApsp), New York"s [Masters At Work (MAW)](https://amzn.to/3KTsg7y), and Detroit's [Moodymann](https://amzn.to/4h9ZZWB) expand on the "black" texture. The number of bases will increase in the UK and Germany, creating a bridge between deep and tech.

**2000s: Listening orientation and sophistication**

Naked Music, Jimpster (Freerange) and more will take you to the lounge-soulful sophistication. In Germany, [Henrik Schwarz](https://amzn.to/4h8i9I4), [Âme](https://amzn.to/47pAIEq), and [Dixon (Innervisions)](https://amzn.to/4heIsN1) are popular for their minimalist to modern architectural aesthetics.

**2010s and beyond: bifurcation and globalization**

Anjunadeep and All Day I Dream turned to melodic/organic music. In South Africa, Black Coffee brings Afro-Deep to world-class standards. With the DIY wave, lo-fi houses are also on the rise.

### Musical features

**Harmony**: Major 7th/9th, suspension chord, lots of tension. Even in a minor key, there is a nuance of "sadness≠tragic".

**Beat**: The kick has a round and deep aftertaste. The hi-hat is a shuffle to a light swing. 909/707/727 and 808 textures are standard.

**Bass**: Mainly undulating long notes with carefully controlled subbands.

**Keyboard/Texture**: Rhodes/M1 organ/soft strings, space type (delay/reverb) is long but not dense.

**Vocal**: Speaking low to mid range, gospel to soul lineage. Make use of "pause" by using the necessary and sufficient number of words.

### What "good deep house DJs" do

- Gradually layer EQ and faders on long mixes (16-32 bars or more).

- Matching key (tonality) and tesserae (timbre): Avoid destroying the atmosphere by selecting songs in adjacent keys/closely related tones.

- Dynamic waves: "Raise the heat a little bit and bring it back quickly" for 30-45 minutes.

- BPM setting that is not too fast: Create a "stride length" at 118–121, then move to 122–124 in the second half.

### Production Tips

**Code**: "Soft margin" with maj7, min9, sus2/4, 6th. Even just the two notes of root + 9th are "deep".

**Tone selection**: Rhodes, M1 Organ, Juno pad, analog sub. The hi-hat is slightly open and thin.

**Groove**: "Breathe" with a light swing (+5 to +15%) and minute changes in velocity.

**Low Pass/Side Chain**: Adds "invisible oscillation" to keep it in ear contact while making it dance.

**Sampling**: Loop a short jazz/soul phrase and let it melt into the space with a long decay.

**Mix**: Kick 40–60Hz is modest, 80–120Hz creates body rumble. Vocals should not output too much 2–5kHz.


<hr>

### Scene and Culture

**Location**: Strong in small boxes/subfloors/after hours.

**Listening context**: Late night drive, work/study BGM, cocktail time.

**Aesthetics**: ""Emotional over functionality''. More shadow than sparkle.


<hr>

### Playlist template (flow example)

**Warm-up**: Blaze style organ groove

**Early peak**: Ron Trent/Chez Damier's driving force

**Plateau**: Refinement of Jimpster ~ Freerange

**Color change**: Henrik Schwarz's live feel

**Late**: Maintain the temperature with Black Coffee's Afro Deep, and cool down with the lingering sound of Larry Heard at the end.

### Tips for collecting and searching records

**Keywords**: "Deep" "Atmospheric" "Dub" "Garage" "Jersey" "Prescription"

**Choose by era**: Early 90s = rough and warm, 00s = sophisticated, 10s and later = wide sound image.

**Label buy**: Prescription/KDJ/Freerange/Innervisions/Mule Musiq/Anjunadeep.

**Must listen to the B-side**: Deep tracks tend to be hidden in the B-side dub.

### Music that can be enjoyed over time, not in a moment

Deep house is music that can be enjoyed over time. Rather than a single, conspicuous hit, there is a ""comfortable continuation'' that keeps the floor and listeners in sync with each other. If you understand everything from historical origins to current sub-styles, and the secrets of production and DJing, you will be able to greatly deepen your selection and appreciation.
