## There is a moment when sound becomes architecture


Text: mmr | Theme: Festivals and cities, sound and light, crowds and technology. How has the phenomenon of EDM changed the shape of celebrations in the 21st century?

A flash of laser light splits the night sky, the bass shakes deep within its body, and countless arms raise in unison.
The phenomenon called "EDM" was more than just a music genre, it was a celebration of the digital age.
In the 2010s, cities around the world were reshaped by the sound. The desert of Las Vegas, the forests of Belgium, the bay of Tokyo.
In this column, we will take a look at EDM's birth, transformation, and "beyond" from the intersection of sound, light, the body, and technology.

### Ⅰ. EDM as a building of light and sound

It was not an extension of the club, but a redesign of the city itself.
Hundreds of thousands of people jump at the same time. The stage is like the gate of a futuristic city.
EDM was the ""festival architecture'' of the 21st century.

Originally, the word EDM was more of a marketing term than a genre name.
However, that ambiguity was a symbol of the times.
It didn't matter if it was house, techno, or trance—what was important was the experience.
Everyone has at least once believed in the illusion that one sound can shake the world.

### Ⅱ. Origin: From Chicago to Las Vegas

The origin of the story is in Chicago's ""Warehouse'' in the 1970s.
Frankie Knuckles' play turned the club into a community.
In the 1980s, techno was born in Detroit, and electronic sounds began to tell the story of the future.

Eventually, in the late 2000s, European club culture was "re-imported" to America.
"Levels" by Avicii, "Don"t You Worry Child" by Swedish House Mafia, "Titanium" by David Guetta.
They weren't just songs, they were a "language of light."
In the 2010s, EDM rose to the center of pop. Underground dreams turned into arena cheers.

### Ⅲ. Evolution of sound design

Behind the sound is a **DAW and synth revolution**.
Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro. We live in an era where you can compose music with just a laptop.
"Massive" by Native Instruments, "Serum" by Xfer, "Sylenth1" by Lennar Digital.
What these developments resulted in was the ""weaponization of sound.''

Especially side chain compression.
That unique "pumping" that makes the whole body breathe in time with the kick.
That's the heartbeat of EDM.
It was the moment when the techniques of club music were extended to the masses.

---

### Ⅳ. Birth of festival culture

Tomorrowland, Ultra, EDC.
Everyone now knows these three initials.

The stage is not just a set, but an **architectural installation**.
A screen envelops the forest and fireworks weave the sky.
The audience becomes "particles of light" and the sound and images are synchronized.
EDM festivals were a new communal ritual created by technology.

A sociologist would say this.
"Democratization of the trance state"——
We live in an era of pseudo-religious experiences where everyone shares the same heartbeat at the same moment.

### Ⅴ. The era of global capital and SNS

EDM was accompanied by a "revolution in distribution."
SoundCloud, YouTube, Beatport.
DJs from all over the world exchanged sounds with a single click.

In the late 2010s, EDM became a meme.
The drop is cut on TikTok and the rhythm goes viral like a GIF.
The Chainsmokers' ""Closer'' is a symbol of this.
A DJ is both a producer and a **brand**.
Logos, perfumes, NFTs, headphones—all have become "industries surrounding sound."

### Ⅵ. Branching and mutation: Post-EDM horizon

Eventually, the celebrations start to wear out.
People who were tired of the glare of the main stage began to return to the dark clubs.

"Introspective EDM" demonstrated by Porter Robinson and Madeon——
It wasn't a festival, it was a sound dealing with individual emotions.
Future Bass, Trap, Tech House, Drumstep.
Genres are branching out, and the term "EDM" no longer has any meaning.

However, at the heart of it all was always a **admiration for technology**.
The resonance between humans and machines, that pleasure, was the essence of EDM.

### VII. EDM acceptance in Japan

EDM took root in Japan in earnest around 2013.
When ULTRA JAPAN landed and ZEDD and Hardwell came to Japan,
The sky over the bay was filled with light.

In Japan, it was first introduced as a "festival" rather than a club.
This may have been an expression of their ""desire for community.''

Yasutaka Nakata, Perfume, Ado——
J-POP absorbed the structure of EDM and evolved into a more dramatic and visual sound.
For the TikTok generation, being able to dance may not be about the body but the movement of the fingertips.
Light bouncing around digitally, crowds behind smartphones.
Japanese EDM has taken on a new form: an introverted celebration.

---

### VIII. Technology and Spirit: Utopia drawn by machines

We have now entered an era where AI generates music in real time.
Still, people still seek ""drops.''
This is because there are moments when your body senses time.

DJs are no longer just "music selectors."
He is a **manipulating composer** who reads the breathing of the crowd in real time.
Lighting, VJ, sound, stage configuration—all synchronize as one comprehensive piece of art.

EDM is at the same time a celebration of technology.
**It was the act of humans using technology to expand their humanity**.

---

### Ⅸ. Final chapter: Towards a post-EDM music experience

The term "EDM" may now seem like a relic of the past.
But its legacy already permeates all genres.
Pop, hip hop, game music...
Inherits the aesthetics of drop structure and sound pressure.

Celebrations from now on will no longer be limited to physical stages.
Metaverse, AR, virtual DJ.
The crowd becomes an avatar, and the light flows as a code.

EDM isn't over.
It's just changing form.
**The digital celebration isn't over yet. **
