Hard rock is a major genre of rock that exploded from the late 1960s to the 1970s. Its musicality is characterized by its bold incorporation of Eastern philosophy and mystical elements, in addition to Western machoism and strength.

### Occultism of Led Zeppelin and Jimmy Page

Led Zeppelin guitarist **Jimmy Page** is more than just a rock guitarist, he is known for his deep devotion to the world of occultism and mysticism. In particular, he had a keen interest in the study of Aleister Crowley, an early 20th century magician and thinker. Page actually purchased Crowley's former residence, Boleskine House, and is said to have studied his thoughts and rituals. This fact is not just an urban legend, but a highly confirmed episode that has been mentioned by multiple music journalists and biographers.

Furthermore, these occult and mystical elements are strongly reflected in Zeppelin"s songs and stage productions. For example, "Stairway to Heaven" has lyrics full of religious and mystical symbolism, reminding the listener of a "journey into the spiritual world." Page"s guitar style also gave his improvisations a mystical quality that had the power to lull the audience into a trance-like state. In other words, he incorporated occultism not just as a hobby or image, but as the basis of musical expression itself.

### Deep Purple and Rainbow Oriental Scale

On the other hand, another trend in hard rock can be seen in the introduction of oriental scales and mystical sounds. Although Deep Purple is rooted in classical music and blues, they occasionally incorporate exotic melodies to give their songs an exotic feel. In particular, Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing includes many phrases reminiscent of Indian music and Arabic scales.

This trend becomes even more evident in **Rainbow**, which was formed by Blackmore. Their signature song "Stargazer" combines oriental scale with mystical lyrics and grand orchestration. This song goes beyond just hard rock; it has a sense of scale, as if it were a musical expression of a grand myth or epic poem. In addition, during the live performance, the production made full use of fire and light, emphasizing the mystical view of the world and providing the audience with an ""otherworldly experience.''

In this way, the music of Deep Purple and Rainbow was not simply an extension of Western rock, but could be said to have created a new musical language by actively introducing Eastern thought and mystical imagery. Their efforts had a great influence on later metal and progressive rock, building a lineage of "mystical hard rock" that continues to this day.

Seen in this way, Led Zeppelin's occult explorations and the introduction of Eastern musical scales by Deep Purple and Rainbow are both elements that elevated hard rock into more than just a musical genre, but a cultural phenomenon.

## Influence of mysticism and oriental thought

Hard rock is not just rebellious music, but also contains philosophical and mystical elements. In particular:

* Introducing **Oriental scales** (pentatonic, raga) to create a unique sound.
* The lyrics often use **mystical symbols** (dragons, fire, contrast between light and darkness).
* **Meditative sounds** explore the spiritual world rather than just releasing energy.

These characteristics give listeners an ""otherworldly experience'' and are still utilized today in the production of soundtracks for movies and game music.
