## Introduction——The existence that broke the "limitations of indie"

Text: mmr｜Theme: From the formation to dissolution of Company Flow, analysis of the work, sound structure, history of the members, historical significance

In New York in the late 1990s, while hip-hop was growing into a huge commercial industry, there was also an underground reactionary energy swirling around it.
Major music groups led by Bad Boy Records were expanding their glittering sounds, but on the street side, an increasing number of artists were seeking a more rigid and politically charged style of expression.

At the center of this was **Company Flow**.
Their 1997 album **Funcrusher Plus** is a landmark in indie hip-hop history.
