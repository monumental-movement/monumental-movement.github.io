## Introduction: Structural changes caused by the absence of rap

Text: mmr｜Theme: Background to the establishment of Glitch Hop, acoustic characteristics, production methods of representative artists, beat analysis, equipment and production environment, relationship with surrounding genres, and subsequent influence

Glitch Hop is a trend of electronic music that is based on the beat structure of hip-hop and combines glitch processing, precise micro-editing, and low-centered bass design. From the late 2000s to the early 2010s, it became apparent as the digital production environment became more sophisticated, and it became established as functional music that cuts across club, listening, and video applications. Although the genre name is a compound word of "Glitch" and "Hip Hop," it is not just a mixture of techniques, but a production philosophy centered on beat deconstruction and reconstruction.

## 1. Historical background and conditions for establishment

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, with the spread of DAW environments and improvements in CPU performance, extreme sample division, nonlinear pitch/time transformation, and real-time effect processing became practical production methods. This created the conditions for glitch-like processing, which had previously been limited to experimental music and art contexts, to move to the center of beat music.

Glitch Hop was created at the intersection of the looping sensation derived from hip-hop and the highly editing-oriented sound processing cultivated in IDM and electronica. While the time signature and tempo are relatively stable, the internal tones are constantly disassembling and reconnecting. This dual structure creates a physical groove and perceptual stimulation at the same time.

## 2. Musical characteristics

### 2.1 Tempo and Groove

Glitch Hop's tempo range is generally centered around 85-110BPM. This goes well with the halftime feel of hip-hop, and maximizes the sense of weight in the low range. The amount of swing is not fixed, but is intentionally adjusted for each track, and both mechanical stiffness and artificial deviation coexist.

### 2.2 Rhythm structure

The basic arrangement of kick and snare is relatively simple, but hi-hats and percussive clicks are extremely fragmented. By further dividing one beat into 16 minutes, 32 minutes, or even more in some cases, and inserting glitch-like stutters and retrigs into the beats, he creates a rhythm that feels both still and accelerating at the same time.

### 2.3 Sound Design

In Glitch Hop, tone plays a more important role than melody. The bass is designed with a multi-layered structure from sub-bass to mid-bass, and distortion, bit crusher, waveshaping, etc. are applied in stages. In the high frequencies, noises, clicks, and short granular fragments are placed as spatial accents.

## 3. Representative artists and production aesthetics

### 3.1 The Glitch Mob

The Glitch Mob has established a method of highly dividing and integrating beats and sound design by utilizing a multi-person production system. Their songs eschew simple loop repetitions, instead changing rhythmic and tonal density with each development.

The bass is designed to be the driving force of the song, and its phase relationship with the kick is strictly controlled. The sub-band is often arranged in a monaural manner, and is characterized by a design that emphasizes stability during club playback.

### 3.2 KOAN Sound

KOAN Sound is known for extremely precise audio editing and advanced mixing techniques. In their songs, different envelopes and filter settings are applied to each note, and the same tone is rarely used consecutively.

The frequency bands each note occupies are clearly separated, minimizing collisions between bass, mids, and highs. This design maintains clear clarity even in complex rhythms.

## 4. Beat analysis

Many Glitch Hop songs are structured in eight-bar units. The first four bars present the basic groove, and the last four bars add glitch processing and fills.

    B --> C["Hi-hat fragment"]
    C --> D["Glitch fill"]
    D --> A
</div>

The important thing is not to fill in every beat. By inserting silence or extremely short sounds, the impact of the next low range is emphasized.

---

## 5. Production process

### 5.1 Sampling

The samples are not limited to drum breaks or existing sound sources, but include a wide variety of things such as noise, environmental sounds, and single notes from synths. These are divided into pieces on the DAW and reassembled as raw materials.

### 5.2 Editing and Automation

In Glitch Hop production, automation forms the very structure. Filter cutoff, distortion amount, panning, etc. change not in bars, but in milliseconds.

---

## 6. Equipment used and production environment

The primary production environment is a DAW, and one that can highly integrate audio editing and MIDI control is preferred. It is important to be able to perform non-destructive editing on a clip-by-clip basis.

Distortion, granular processing, multiband compressor, and limiter are the core. In particular, multiband processing is essential for achieving both low-frequency control and high-frequency precision.

---

## 7. Relationship with surrounding genres

While Dubstep emphasizes slow tempos and spatial spacing, Glitch Hop emphasizes editing density and rhythmic fragmentation.

The intellectual experimentation of IDM is inherited by Glitch Hop, but it differs in that it brings more physical grooves to the fore.

## 9. Impact and development

Glitch Hop's editing techniques influenced trap, bass music, and even pop production. In particular, the idea of ​​subdividing the internal beats and emphasizing sound design became a standard method in subsequent electronic music production.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Glitch Hop is a genre born from the combination of technological evolution and production aesthetics. By combining the physicality of hip-hop with the perceptual stimulation of glitch, it is positioned as one of the foundations of modern beat music, rather than just a passing style.

## 11. Beat decomposition analysis by measure

While the beat structure of Glitch Hop is conservative in its four-beat framework, its internal resolution is extremely high. In this chapter, we will use one bar as the smallest unit of analysis and examine how kick, snare, hi-hat, and glitch elements are arranged and transformed.

In typical Glitch Hop, a strong kick is often placed on the first beat, but at the same time, the sublayer often sounds with a slight delay. This delay of several milliseconds is not a physical delay, but an intentional design to emphasize the sense of weight in the low range.

The snare is often placed on the second and fourth beats, but the attack and tail parts may be composed of separate samples. This allows the sense of hit and reverberation to be controlled independently, making the groove stable and unstable at the same time.

The hi-hat is not just a tick, it functions as a rhythm density adjustment device. By creating a section in which the number of notes is intentionally reduced within a measure, and immediately after that section, the music is subdivided into extreme pieces, the listener's sense of time is disturbed.

## 12. Sound analysis by frequency band

The low range is the core of Glitch Hop, and is the area that directly elicits a physical response. Here, sub-bass is often treated as an intermittent impulse rather than a sustained sound. Compression is applied strongly, but the release time is set relatively short to avoid excessive expansion.

In this band, the kick's body rumble and bass overtones tend to overlap, resulting in turbidity. In Glitch Hop, emphasis is placed on distinction at the tone design stage rather than reduction through EQ. As a result, there are many cases in which the band itself becomes relatively hollow.

The midrange is the area responsible for the legibility of rhythmic information, where clicks, short noises, and processed percussion are concentrated. Here, transients are emphasized and an extremely short note length is set to ensure the clarity of the sound image.

The high frequency range is responsible for spatial information and texture. In Glitch Hop, constant sound is avoided, and it is only inserted sharply at the moment of need. This emphasizes the contrast in the development while reducing the burden on the ears.

---

## 13. Mixing philosophy and space design

In a Glitch Hop mix, depth is expressed not by the amount of reverberation, but by the sharpness of the attack and the rate of decay. Notes placed in the front have short tails, while notes placed in the back have long tails.

While the low range is fixed almost in the center, the glitch elements in the mid and high range are actively placed to the left and right. Autopan is often used to avoid static positioning.

---

## 14. Mastering and final sound image

Excessive sound pressure competition is not necessarily the main purpose of Glitch Hop. Rather, the emphasis is on the contrast between momentary peaks and silence. Therefore, the limiter functions as a safety device, and there is a strong tendency for the expression itself to be completed at the mixing stage.

## 16. Summary

Glitch Hop is a genre that was established as a result of raising the editing resolution of beat music to the maximum. Judgments made in one measure, one note, and even in milliseconds are directly connected to the final physical sensation. In that sense, Glitch Hop is not only a collection of production techniques, but also a system of thought that designs the listening experience itself.
