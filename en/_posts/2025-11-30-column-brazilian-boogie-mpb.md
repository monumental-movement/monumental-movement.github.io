## Preface

Text: mmr｜Theme: Development of Boogie and MPB, representative artists and major works, re-evaluation overseas, and influence on modern times

The Brazilian music scene from the late 1970s to the early 1980s saw a variety of expressions emerge amidst political repression, and came to be reevaluated in the context of the global rare groove. In particular, **Brazilian Boogie** is attracting attention for its urban, danceable music style that incorporates elements of funk, soul, and disco while following the flow of MPB (Música Popular Brasileira).
