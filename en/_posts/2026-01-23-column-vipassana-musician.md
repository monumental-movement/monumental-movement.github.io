## What is Vipassana meditation?

> Vipassana is an old meditation method that means ""seeing things as they really are,'' and is still widely practiced today as a way to cultivate a balanced mind through self-observation and mental purification.

Vipassana meditation has its roots in the Buddhist tradition, but it has become widespread as a universal technique that is separate from religion.
The basics are **carefully observing your breathing and bodily sensations, and recognizing the natural flow of thoughts and emotions**.

Modern practitioners often report that they can quiet their mental reactions through observation and awareness, and as a result **creativity and concentration improve**.
