The Explorers are a group formed by former members of the progressive rock band Roxy Music, Phil Manzanera and Andy MacKay, with James Wraith on vocals.

The Explorers released their self-titled LP ""Explorers'' on Virgin Records in 1985, but disbanded in 1986.

This record is a single cut from the self-titled album.

After The Explorers disbanded, Phil Manzanera and Andy MacKa each pursued solo careers.
