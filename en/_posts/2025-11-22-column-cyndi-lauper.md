# **1. Introduction: The phenomenon of Cyndi Lauper**


Text: mmr｜Theme: Cyndi Lauper's life, episodes in Japan before her debut, global success, anecdotes from We Are the World, advancement to Broadway, social activities


Cyndi Lauper. When many people hear the name, they may immediately think of the bright colors of the 80s. Her hair color, clothes, singing voice, and even her way of life are all colorful. However, when we look back at the path she has taken since her birth, we see that the diversity of her path is more like a stratum made up of layer upon layer of suffering, setbacks, anxiety, love, and rebelliousness.

# **2. Childhood and family background: A girl with an "unusual voice" born in Queens**

Cyndi Lauper was born in Queens, New York in 1953. Her mother is an Italian-American woman who loves art and theater. There was a rift with his father, and the family environment was not peaceful. I grew up in what is called a "complicated family."

When Cindy was young, she was the kind of kid who would sing just about anything. He sang next to his mother in the kitchen and even in the backyard of the house, and may have been a little noisy to his siblings. However, the singing voice was different from normal. It"s tall, stretchy, looks like it"s going to make you cry, and yet it's strong. I was even told by a teacher at school, ""You should tone down that strange voice a little.''

Nowadays, her voice is a worldwide trademark, but as a child, Cindy lacked confidence in her own voice, and there was a time when she worried that ""everyone thought my voice was strange.''

However, her mother loved the voice very much. This is because even in the midst of difficult family situations, Cindy's singing voice brought brightness into the home.

# **3. Youth: Rebellious spirit and inclination towards art**

In her adolescence, Cindy turned to art, painting, writing poetry, and trying anything creative. I tried to go to art school, but even there I couldn't adapt to the environment where I was obsessed with "rules" and "correct expression."

Cyndi Lauper's life has a consistent theme. It is a strong will that says, ""I want to be myself.'' This will was honed when she was around the age of 20, moving around the crowded streets of New York.

During this time, she wore unique fashion combinations at thrift stores and flea markets. The ""unique and colorful fashion'' that came to be seen later on was born in part because people could not afford to buy new items when they were poor.

The roots of music are soul, blues, rock, and musicals. The city of New York was the best "free music college" for her.

# **4. Meeting with Japanese woman Sakue Suzuki before her debut**

Shortly before her major debut in the 1980s, Cindy was living a not-so-easy life, juggling music activities and part-time jobs. At that time, his life was supported by the help of a Japanese woman. That woman was Sakue Suzuki, who ran a Japanese restaurant.

Mr. Sakue provided Cindy, who was still unknown and in need, with meals for free, and continued to provide emotional support. Cindy later said, ""Sakue was an important member of my family.''

This experience later became one of the reasons why she regarded Japan in a special way. She is not just an ""artist who often visits Japan for performances", but a ""gratitude for Japan" that lives at her core.

# **5. Blue Angel Era: Struggles, Collapse, and Vocal Cord Damage**

Cindy began her career as a professional singer in the late 1970s when she formed a band called Blue Angel.
Blue Angel has a unique musical style that is a mix of rockabilly, R&B, and new wave, and is quite unique even today. However, due to contract issues with the management company and financial circumstances, the band did not last long.

And here comes the big misfortune.
Due to overuse of her vocal cords, she suffered from severe vocal cord nodules.

The situation is such that doctors say, ""It may be difficult for him to return as a singer.''
This was in the early 1980s.

Cindy cried. But he didn't give up. She reevaluated her vocal technique from scratch, got a coach, continued rehabilitation, and finally regained her singing voice. It can be said that the struggles she faced during this period were the reason why she did not give up in the face of any adversity later on.

# **6. Solo contract and destiny begins**

Around 1981-82, Cindy begins singing in nightclubs. Here, her overwhelming singing voice once again attracted attention and caught the attention of those in the industry. Her life takes a turn when she meets David Wolfe, who later becomes her manager.

At the time, the music industry tended to judge female artists, especially those with too much individuality, as ""difficult." However, Cindy's ""difficulty" was what made her attractive.

In 1983, I finally got a contract for my solo debut.
This is where Cyndi Lauper's "world domination" begins.

# **7. "She"s So Unusual" – Birth of a masterpiece that will go down in pop history**

The album "She"s So Unusual", recorded in 1983 and released in early 1984, has been passed down as a masterpiece in music history.

Bright, fun, free, and a little sad.
Perhaps it was because the overall atmosphere was ""Cindy-like'' that it captured the hearts of so many people.

Musicality wasn't the only thing that made this album a success.
With the rise of MTV, we entered an era in which images influenced music, and Cindy had an overwhelming visual impact. Colorful costumes, overly free hairstyles, and a music video featuring people running around in back alleys. All of them were perfect for the ""atmosphere of the times.''

## **7-1. A deep dive into representative songs**

### **Girls Just Want to Have Fun**

Synonyms for Cindy. It"s a light-hearted anthem praising women"s freedom to enjoy themselves, but it was originally written from a male perspective. Cindy changed the lyrics and nuance, and it became a symbol of women's freedom.

### **Time After Time**

Although it"s a ballad, Cindy"s high notes are powerful and at the same time delicate enough to make your heart clench.
It is said that the feelings of a time when a relationship with a lover is not going well are reflected in the song.

### **She Bop**

It was a very daring song for its time, a pop song about sexuality.

# **8. Reception in Japan and episode of coming to Japan**

In the 1980s, Japanese pop culture was rapidly blossoming, and the number of foreign artists visiting Japan was increasing. Under such circumstances, Cyndi Lauper is loved by Japanese people in a different way than other artists.

Why?
There are three reasons.

1. **Good compatibility between the visuals and Japan"s 80"s fashion culture**
2. **The warmth of her personality**
3. **Special affinity for Japan**

She enjoys Japanese food every time she visits Japan and quickly becomes friends with the local staff. During the 1994 Japan tour, when he heard that there was a fan with a disability in the audience, he took time after the stage to meet him in person.

In addition, the 2001 album ""Shine" was released only in Japan. This is said to have been a way of ""giving back to the Japanese fans."

# **9. "We Are the World" - A historic night and the accessory incident**

""We Are the World'' is a charity song created in 1985 to help with the African famine.
Participants included "American music's dream team" including Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Dionne Warwick, and Bruce Springsteen.

The recording studio was filled with a strange sense of tension.
Meanwhile, Cindy causes an "incident".

### **An incident where an accessory hit the microphone and caused noise**

The large number of accessories she was wearing around her neck hit the microphone, causing a clattering noise.

Engineer: "What's that sound?"
Quincy Jones: "Cindy, can you...take that?"

Cindy burst out laughing and said, "Oh, sorry!" as she removed her accessories, and it is said that the atmosphere instantly relaxed.

This incident has been passed down as an episode that symbolizes Cindy's "ability to turn tension into laughter."

# **10. Late 80s to 90s: From pop star to artist**

From the late '80s to the '90s, Cindy was torn between commercial success and a desire for artistic expression.

### **Hat Full of Stars (1993)**

This work shows her maturation as an artist, dealing with themes such as domestic violence, trauma, and social issues. Although it was not a huge commercial hit, it received high praise from music critics.

# **11. 2000s: Experimental period across genres**

In the 2000s, she began to freely transcend the boundaries of genres, such as blues albums, country-oriented songs, and dance music. On each tour, they entertained fans in a different way each time, including acoustic and band formations.

Cindy did not place any value on ""repeating successful forms" and valued ""being true to who I am now" above all else.

# **12. Challenge to Broadway: Wins Tony Award for "Kinky Boots"**

In 2013, he was in charge of the lyrics and composition for the musical "Kinky Boots" and won the Tony Award for Best Original Song.

Originally, Cindy grew up not only as a singer, but also deeply influenced by expressive culture such as movies and theater. That came to fruition in the form of Broadway.

In this work, she strongly conveys the message that it's okay to live your life the way you are. It is also her own life philosophy, and has received great support from the LGBTQ community.

Cindy has long been known as a supporter of the LGBTQ community.
He has a particular interest in the issue of youth homelessness and founded the True Colors Foundation.

She said in an interview:

> "I have a voice. If those who can use a voice don't speak up, who will?"

I believe that the reason I became famous was to help people in weaker situations, and I continue to act based on this belief.

# **14. Latest: Farewell Tour and Cultural Heritage**

But she's not retiring.
This shows a strong desire to continue cultural activities in ways other than music.

Now, younger generations are rediscovering Cindy through YouTube and TikTok, and are appreciating her voice, fashion, and way of life.

# **17. Summary: Cyndi Lauper's "Freedom"**

The reason why Cyndi Lauper has been loved for over 40 years is...
Because she is the embodiment of freedom.

Even if my voice has changed,
Even if you are poor,
Even if there are difficult times,
Even if you become a global star,
Even if you succeed on Broadway,

She has always chosen to live her own life.

That way of life is her greatest music and her greatest message.
