  change'

## Prologue Completely different voices born from the same island

Text: mmr｜Theme: Organizing roots reggae and dancehall from the perspective of generational change, and depicting the continuity of reggae culture that continues to the present day.

The history of Jamaican music becomes clearer when read as a change of generations rather than an evolution of genres. Roots reggae and dancehall were not competing values, but musical languages ​​chosen by young people who lived in different eras to respond to their own realities.

Roots reggae, which came of age in the 1970s when post-independence ideals were still communal, placed social messages and spirituality at the heart of its music. As exemplified by Bob Marley and Burning Spear, songs transcended the individual and functioned as a collective voice.

Since the 1980s, the dancehall generation, who grew up in an urban environment where economic instability and violence have become commonplace, values ​​immediate results over ideals and instantaneousness over permanence. Figures like Shabba Ranks exemplified the shift in music to a place where it was directly linked to survival.

> The two genres are mirrors of how different generations lived in the same society.

## Chapter 1 Social background and expression of the roots reggae generation

In Jamaica during the 1960s and 1970s, when the roots-reggae generation grew up, politics and culture were closely intertwined. Before music was entertainment, it was education and a device for sharing ideas. The reason why Bob Marley's songs were accepted across national borders was because, more than just the melody, there was a universal theme of oppression and liberation.

Artists like Burning Spear and Culture inscribed history and memory into songs, expanding personal history into collective history. The rhythm was slow, heavy, and repetitive, creating a structure that gave the listener time to think.

What is important about roots reggae is that before the artists are stars, they are storytellers. Music was not a means of self-expression, but a medium to preserve the beliefs of a generation.

> Roots reggae is the record of the last generation that shared its ideals.

---

## Chapter 2 The invention of dub and changes in the view of music

Dub was born from within the roots reggae generation, but its thinking became a bridge to the next generation. The mixing methods of King Tubby and Lee Perry presented a perspective that viewed music as a variable structure rather than a finished product.

Dub's sense of subtracting sound and emphasizing space is directly connected to later dancehall and digital production. What is important here is that the process has begun to be valued more than the authorship.

> Dub transformed reggae from an ideology-based music to a structure-based music.

## Chapter 3: Sound system culture, a generation renewal device

The sound system was a place for music to be played, and at the same time, it was a device for changing the protagonists between generations. This culture, which allowed even young people without a studio or musical instrument to participate as selectors or MCs, temporarily dismantled hierarchical structures.

At the Sound Clash scene, the audience's reaction was everything. The improvisational nature and competitive spirit developed here will form the values ​​of the dancehall generation.

> The sound system was a place where generations could reclaim music.

---

## Chapter 4 Digitalization and the rise of the dancehall generation

In the mid-1980s, the conditions for music production changed completely with the spread of digital riddim. The environment in which music could be produced by a small number of people, in a short time, and at low cost gave the younger generation a decisive freedom.

Dancehall artists such as Shabba Ranks value immediate reaction over long-term evaluation. Lyrics became everyday and direct, and music became completely connected to life.

> Dancehall was a quick fix to survive uncertain times.

---

## Chapter 5 Misunderstanding of the narrative of intergenerational conflict

Roots reggae and dancehall are often talked about in opposition, but many dancehall artists grew up listening to roots. There was no denial, just a transformation.

Spirituality has not disappeared, but has transformed into self-affirmation, survival strategy, and physical expression.

> Conflict is an illusion; the reality is the history of successive generations.

## Supplementary chapter Expansion of the history of reggae reception in Japan (from the 1990s)

In the 1990s, when reggae spread widely in Japan, a distinctive feature was that roots and dancehall were introduced at the same time. Imported record stores, clubs, and magazines editorially juxtaposed the two, making the generational conflict relative.

In the context of club culture, dancehall was consumed on the same level as hip-hop and techno, and was accepted as a music of physicality. On the other hand, outdoor festivals and record culture tended to emphasize the spirituality of roots reggae.

Record stores were not just sales centers, but knowledge centers. As the selector culture developed, a uniquely Japanese interpretation was formed.

> Japan's acceptance of reggae has matured as an editorial culture rather than a generational theory.

---

## Chapter 6 Connection to modern times (2000s and later)

Since the 2000s, dancehall has become global and roots reggae has been reevaluated. The evolution of the digital environment has blurred the boundaries between generations.

Contemporary artists simultaneously reference the spirituality of roots and the immediacy of dancehall. This does not mean the end of the conflict, but rather the advancement of generational theory to the next stage.

> Modern reggae is a multilayered culture that encompasses all generations.

## Final Chapter Even if generations change, reggae never ends

Roots reggae and dancehall are different answers given by different generations to the same reality. Renewal, not confrontation. This continuity has allowed the culture of reggae to survive to this day.

> Reggae has always been transformed for the next generation.
