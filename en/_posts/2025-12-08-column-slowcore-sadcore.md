## Red House Painters / Reconsidering the "gravity created by a small number of sounds" centered on Low

Text: mmr｜Theme: Musical characteristics, recording methods, equipment, compatibility with video, and changes from the 1990s to the present day

Slowcore/Sadcore is a trend of ""extremely slowed down alternative rock'' that was formed mainly in America in the 1990s. It is the opposite of grunge/alternative, which uses intensity and distortion as its energy source, and is characterized by a minimal, tranquil, introspective, and submerged sound.

Representative bands include **Red House Painters (1989-)**, **Low (1993-)**, **Codeine (1989-1994)**, **Idaho (1992-)**, and **Galaxie 500 (1987-1991)**.

# 1. Definition of Slowcore / Sadcore
The term slowcore has been used by media and critics since the early 1990s, and there is no clear originator. Sadcore is no different, and artists themselves often reject this label.

However, the common characteristics are as follows.

## ■ Musical characteristics (fact-based)
- **Slow tempo (around 50-80 BPM)**
- **Vocals are restrained and indifferent**
- **Guitar mainly uses clean, lots of reverb and echo**
- **The number of notes is extremely small and the dynamics of the song are gentle**
- **Lyrics tend to be about introspection, loneliness, memory, and everyday life**
- **Brush, light touch, simple pattern for drums**

This sound has a structure that conversely brings out emotions through ""quietness.''

---

# 2. Origin of Slowcore
## ■ The "stillness" part of Dream Pop / Shoegaze
In the late 1980s, **Galaxie 500** are considered to be the forerunners of slowcore, with their laid-back tempos, dreamy guitars, and emotionless vocals.

## ■ Tranquility as the opposite of Grunge
In 1991, during the alternative explosion symbolized by Nirvana"s ""Nevermind," the attitude of ""don"t dare to turn up the volume" emerged as a paradoxical alternative.

## ■ Midwestern American indie aesthetics
Focusing on small labels in regional cities such as Minnesota, Ohio, and California, **a rustic recording environment = Lo-Fi aesthetics** became associated with slowcore.

---

# 3. Major artists and representative works

## ■ Red House Painters
- **Formed: 1989 (San Francisco)**
- Essentially **Mark Kozelek**'s project.
- Symbolizes slowcore with long songs, deep reverb, and narrative lyrics.

### Masterpiece
- *Red House Painters I* (1993)
- *Red House Painters II* (1993)
- *Ocean Beach* (1995)

**Special points:**
Songs such as ""Katy Song" and ""Funhouse" have a structure in which the ""extension between notes'' amplifies emotion due to their tranquility and length (6 to 10 minutes).

---

## ■ Low
- **Formed: 1993 (Duluth, Minnesota)**
- A three-piece consisting of Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker.

### Features
- Mimi Parker's minimalist drums (brush-based)
- Male and female harmony with Alan
- Clearly stated "slow, quiet" as the band concept

### Masterpiece
- *I Could Live in Hope* (1994)
- *Things We Lost in the Fire* (2001)
- *C"mon* (2011)

---

## ■ Codeine
- **Formed: 1989 (New York)**
- A band synonymous with slowcore.
- With a more rock-oriented approach, it has also been described as a slower version of Sonic Youth.

### Masterpiece
- *Frigid Stars* (1990)
- *The White Birch* (1994)

---

## ■Idaho
- **Formed: 1992 (Los Angeles)**
- Features a unique tone using a 4-string guitar (2 fewer than usual).

### Masterpiece
- *This Way Out* (1994)
- *Hearts of Palm* (2000)

---

# 4. Slowcore sound creation: equipment and recording methods

## ■ Guitar
- Fender Telecaster / Stratocaster
-Gibson Les Paul
- Clean-oriented amplifiers such as Fender Twin Reverb, Vox, and Mesa/Boogie

### ■ Effect
- Reverb (Plate, Hall)
- Delay (Analog Delay / Digital Delay)
- Tremolo
- Chorus (minimum required)

**Although the number of sounds is small, "reverberation" forms the framework of the sound. **

---

## ■ Drums
- brush
- Soft mallet
- Minimal configuration with suppressed tom/snare
- Extremely simple pattern

example:


| Kick --- | Snare ----- | Hat - |


Controlling ""margin length'' is more important than tempo.

---

## ■ Recording method
- Home recording (Lo-Fi) ~ Analog tape recording is common
- Less compression
- Naturally captures room reverb
- Maintain a sense of distance by keeping the microphone close to each other

In Slowcore, the ""pauses" and ""atmosphere" of recording are themselves instruments.

---

# 5. Psychological effects of slowness
From a musical psychology point of view, music with a slow tempo and low information content promotes the following:

- **Self-reflection**
- **Emotional calm**
- **Expansion of time awareness (songs feel longer)**

Therefore, when Slowcore is frequently used in movies, photographs, and video works, it exhibits extremely strong compatibility when expressing ""stopped time''.

---

# 6. Affinity with visual culture
Slowcore is particularly compatible with the following video productions.

- Static images of ruins, beaches, dusk, etc.
- long shot
- Extremely small cut percentage
- Monochrome, low saturation, film-like

In fact, songs by Red House Painters and Low have been used in numerous movies and personal video works.
Video genres such as ""Slowcore edit" and ""Sadcore atmosphere" have been formed on YouTube.

---

# 7. Slowcore since 2000s
## ■ Examples of inherited artists
- **Duster** (1996~) Re-evaluation
- **Cigarettes After Sex** (2012~)
- **Grouper** (Liz Harris)
- **Bedhead / The New Year**

These inherit Slowcore's ""static emotional expression'' while merging with Ambient, Dream Pop, and Drone.

# 10. Summary
Slowcore/Sadcore is a genre that was born in the 1990s in American indie music and places value on ""quietness.'' Slow tempo, few notes, distant reverberations, and introspective lyrics. These were born as the opposite of intense music, but now they are once again in the spotlight in visual culture and social media.

Rather, the limitation of ""few sounds'' **allows the listener to sink deeper into the music, allowing the contours of the world to emerge more clearly**.
Slowcore is a unique type of music that quietly depicts the smallest units of emotion.
