## Summary: From engine sound to sound art — a vision of the future of cars and sound

Cars used to be "machines for transportation". However, now it is a ""space that embraces sound'' and is an extension of culture.
Germany has imbued sound with precision engineering, Britain with tradition and formality, America with freedom and power, and Japan with delicate harmony.
Car audio in each country is also a crystallization of that society's aesthetic sense and industrial philosophy.

Rolls-Royce's "silent stage" is the ultimate in silence.
Tesla's DSP control connects electrical signals and emotions.
And Mark Levinson of Lexus plays with materials and space as "instruments."
These are not just speaker systems, but ""architectures of sound'' where humans and machines, engineering, and sensibilities intersect.

Now that the shift to EVs is progressing, the symbolic element of engine sound is disappearing,
In-car acoustics are beginning to take on a new role.
It is a "moving listening room" and a "personal acoustic universe."
Manufacturers around the world are no longer pursuing horsepower or quietness;
**"What kind of sounds can you hear by running?"** This is a new experience value.

Car audio never stops evolving.
The acoustic design is corrected by AI, and the seat becomes a resonating plate, changing the sound field according to the driver's heartbeat and mood.
What we will end up with is a realm of sonic equality that transcends countries and brands.
The act of listening while running sharpens human sensibilities once again.

What cars tell us is not the road, but the journey of sound.
And that journey has only just begun.
