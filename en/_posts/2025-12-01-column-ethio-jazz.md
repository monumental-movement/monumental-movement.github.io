# # 1. The foundation of Ethiopian music: the pentatonic scale (kinet) and unique modal culture

Ethiopia has had a multi-layered musical culture since ancient times, including Ethiopian Orthodox chants (Zara), the Azmari culture of local bards, and the urban music of the capital Addis Ababa.

Particularly famous is Ethiopia's unique modal system called ""qenet.''
There are four typical Kinets:

* **Tizita**: A melancholy mode, the central mode of Ethio-Jazz.
* **Bati**
* **Ambassel**
* **Anchihoye**

These have a unique scale movement that is different from Western major/minor,
It later became an important foundation for Mulatu's fusion with jazz.

# # 2. 1950–60s: Mulatu Astatuke's overseas study and musical formation

Mulatu Astatuke (1943–) was born in Jimma, Ethiopia.
At a young age, he chose to study abroad, first traveling to England where he was exposed to the jazz and Latin music of the time.
He then moved to the United States and became one of the first African students to study jazz and arranging at Berklee College of Music.

### ▼ Elements of musical formation

* Ethiopian traditional mode
* Jazz theory (especially modal jazz)
