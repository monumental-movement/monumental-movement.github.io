title: Motiv One – Cosmik Loop Progression
---


"Cosmik" has a light rhythm with a nice key break and a slightly jazzy, futuristic sound. It's not too heavy, and there's no amen break used here, but it's a solid track overall. It was also included on Bukem's first Progression Sessions CD.

"Loop Progression" is another great track, starting with a tough, driving beat before gradually emerging as softer keys combine with the chords. A break follows, followed by a huge, truly huge Amen kick and a cosmic style sound, with the bass kicking in for good measure as well. The great part goes through some bridges and chords, followed by an outro beat followed by a heavy amen beat.
