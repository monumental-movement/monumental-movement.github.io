## "Intermediate format" of 10 inches


Text: mmr｜Theme: Neither 7 inches nor 12 inches. The aesthetics of sound and memories of the times told by the 10-inch medium format


10インチレコード。  
There is a certain ambiguity in that word. It has a unique yet half-finished presence that is different from the immediate effect of a 7-inch single or the satisfying feeling of a 12-inch LP. If we look at the history of records, we can see how this "intermediate format" marked a turning point in the times.

10 inches is not just a matter of size. It was also another philosophy that redefined ""length of time" and ""density of sound." The restriction of around 10 minutes per side forced artists and engineers to choose ""condensation,'' and the result was a surprisingly well-defined sound and a listening experience that required concentration.

"Just long enough to take a drink by the time you finish listening."
The aesthetics of 10 inches resides in this sense of time.

### 技術史としての10インチ：回転数・溝幅・音質のバランス

The appeal of the 10-inch cannot be explained simply by being "in between the sizes."
それは物理的にも、音響的にも絶妙なバランスの上に成り立っている。

1950年代初頭、33⅓回転LPと78回転SPの狭間に生まれた10インチ盤は、片面約10〜12分という収録時間を持っていた。この長さは、当時のジャズやクラシックのセッションにおいて、最も自然な“演奏単位”と一致していた。フルセットの演奏を無理なく収められる時間。これが、12インチへの移行前に多くのレーベルが10インチを採用した理由のひとつである。

さらに、盤面が小さいことで内周歪みが軽減され、音の立ち上がりが鮮明になる。 Among cutting engineers, it is often said that the 10-inch sound has a core. This characteristic was especially effective for music that emphasizes the freshness of the midrange rather than the extension of the low range.

### 1950s 10-inch Golden Age: Experimental Ground for Jazz and Classical Music

The 10-inch was at its peak during the dawn of jazz in the early 1950s.
Labels like Blue Note, Prestige, and Clef confined artists' experimentation to the 10-inch format.

マイルス・デイヴィス["Young Man with a Horn"](https://amzn.to/4qkdGGC)（1952）、セロニアス・モンク["Thelonious Monk Trio"](https://amzn.to/4ol2uI1)（1954）、チャーリー・パーカー["Now"s the Time"](https://amzn.to/4qkfrUe)（1953）。 All of these works were like ""short films'' that sought the best composition within the constraints of 10 inches.

12インチLPの登場以前、10インチは“LP”という新しい概念の試験場だった。長尺作品のフォーマットが定まらないなかで、10インチはアーティストに「まとまり」を与え、同時に「切り取られた瞬間」の濃密さを残した。

そして見逃せないのが、ジャケットデザインの進化である。 Blue Note, which preceded the appearance of Reid Miles, was known for its simple compositions that made use of typography and photo margins, but the golden ratio was most beautifully expressed in the 10-inch era.

### The return of the forgotten size: in the context of punk, alternative and indie

Eventually, 12-inch LPs dominated the market, and 10-inches were relegated to the margins of history.
だが1980年代、パンクとインディの流れが再びこのフォーマットを呼び戻す。

The reason was simple.
"More than a 7-inch and lighter than an LP."
Production costs are kept low and distribution is easy.さらに、奇妙なサイズ感が"DIY感"や"限定感"を演出した。 Sonic Youthの["Death Valley "69"](https://amzn.to/3KIwEX6)や、Pavementの["Watery, Domestic"](https://amzn.to/48q3eqp)。どれも10インチという形で登場し、アートワークを含めた"モノとしての美学"を提示した。

When Radiohead released [Com Lag (2plus2isfive)](https://amzn.to/4nEgRXM) on a 10-inch, they had a clear intention.フルアルバムでもなく、シングルでもない。 The 10-inch has regained meaning as the perfect medium for bands to share their experimental side with listeners.

### 10-inch culture in Japan: minimalism and craftsmanship

In Japan, 10-inch discs are often treated as "rare discs."
However, because of its scarcity, it creates a special attachment to it.

東洋化成をはじめとする国内プレス工場の精密な技術は、10インチのような微妙なフォーマットにこそ真価を発揮する。 The silence of the board, the smoothness of the hands, and the color of the print. Each one is the result of a craftsman's sensitivity.

In recent years, an increasing number of artists have chosen 10-inch discs, such as Haruomi Hosono"s [10-inch reissue] (https://amzn.to/4nMnl7a), Tabito Nanao [""Little Melody"] (https://amzn.to/46SV7QE), and Shintaro Sakamoto [""God of Disco"] (https://amzn.to/4oaCpen). It"s not just nostalgia, but an act of redesigning "listening time."

"It's short, but intense."
The Japanese aesthetic of "ma" naturally blends into the 10-inch format.

### 物理メディアの再定義：10インチが示す未来のフォーマット哲学

ストリーミング全盛の今、フォーマットの差異は本来、音に関係ないはずだ。  
However, the existence of a 10-inch camera shakes that assumption.

Short playback time encourages concentration.
Small size creates intimacy.
Physical constraints, on the other hand, highlight the contours of the act of "listening."

When we pick up a 10-inch camera, we are also picking up "time."
It is a music experience that is conscious of the end, unlike a playlist that flows endlessly due to an algorithm. Drop the needle and turn the board over. This series of actions is the ""aesthetics of inefficiency'' that the 10-inch speaks to today.

### Final Chapter: Time in the palm of your hand, 10-inch speaks about the "density of sound"

10 inches is incomplete yet complete.
It's not a long story or a short story, but a "short story" format.
Music in the palm of your hand. However, its density is not inferior to 12 inches.

A format is not just a container, it is an idea.
10インチの再評価は、音楽の“聴かれ方”そのものを問い直す行為だ。

There is always a ""middle'' between technologies.
その曖昧さの中にこそ、表現の自由と実験精神が宿る。  
The 10-inch size quietly tells us this.
