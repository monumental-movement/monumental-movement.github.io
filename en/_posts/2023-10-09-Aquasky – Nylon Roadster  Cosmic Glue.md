title: Aquasky – Nylon Roadster Cosmic Glue
---


While many Moving Shadow releases from 1996 to 1997 leaned too heavily into jazzy tunes, this release from Aquasky proved that gentle drum & bass doesn't have to be boring.

Nylon Roadster is a smooth track, with a subdued breakbeat that doesn't interfere too much. The heart of this track is the gentle and very emotional piano section in the middle.

I can imagine it being used perfectly as a lullaby. It's a really great song.
