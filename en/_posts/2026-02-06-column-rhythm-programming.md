## Prologue: Rhythm is designed, not played.

Text: mmr｜Theme: View rhythm programming as a design concept rather than a performance technique, and decipher the overall picture of modern beat aesthetics from the design of 16 steps, loops, and tone arrangement.


Rhythm programming is not a matter of lining up the dots accurately. It is an act of design: how to divide time, where to emphasize, and where to leave blank space. If performance is a series of instantaneous decisions, programming is similar to thinking from a bird's-eye view of time as a whole.

With the advent of drum machines and sequencers, rhythm became separated from the body and became an object to be treated visually and numerically. This shift created a need to redefine the vague concept of groove at the expense of precision.

> Rhythm programming is the act of designing the very way we perceive time.

## Chapter 1: Mechanical time and 4/4/16 step design

The basic unit of electronic rhythm design is 16 steps, which are divided into 16 4/4 time signatures. This equal division functions not as an aid to performance, but as a coordinate system for design.

### 4/4・16 steps basic layout example

The most basic structure is to place the kick on the 1st and 3rd beats and the snare on the 2nd and 4th beats. This arrangement creates a sense of stability, but nothing more and nothing less.

Accent design does not require all notes to be played at the same intensity. By simply making the first beat of the kick the strongest and the third beat a little weaker, you can create a sense of front and back in the flow of time.

### Case: Fixed strong beat and shifted strong beat

* Strong beat fixed: 1st and 3rd beats are always at maximum intensity
*Strong beat shift: 1st beat maximum, 3rd beat suppressed

In the latter, the second half feels lighter and the loop gives the impression of rolling forward.

> The 16 equal divisions are not a final design, but a draft for the design.

---

## Chapter 2: Grid and Human Feel Design

An arrangement that perfectly follows the grid fixes time, but does not move it. This is where intentional deviations are introduced.

### Case: Backbeat Snare Delay

By delaying the snare on the fourth beat by a few milliseconds, the rhythm feels pulled back. This is a structured version of the movements that human drummers perform unconsciously.

### Case: Hi-hat front groove design

If you move the back of the 8-minute or 16-minute hi-hat slightly forward, the whole thing will feel progressive. The important thing is not to move all the tones by the same amount.

> Humanity is a design that chooses places that break evenness.

---

## Chapter 3: Density control with accents and thinning

In rhythm design, more sounds are not always better. Density is the amount of information and also the auditory load.

### Case: 16 minutes full placement and thinning

If you place a hi-hat on all 16 steps, time will be chopped up, but space will be lost. Just by omitting one sound every four steps creates breathing.

### Case: Pseudo-polyrhythm by accent

By shifting the accents at regular intervals, multiple periods are perceived even though they are actually a single period.

> The framework of the rhythm emerges from the sounds that are not played.

---

## Chapter 4: Hierarchical design of iteration and change

A loop is established through repetition, but complete repetition suspends the sense of time.

### Case: Change within one measure

The end of the loop is signaled by removing the hi-hat or adding a ghost note in the final 16 minutes.

### Case: 4-bar fill design

Adding a snare roll only in the fourth measure creates a structural break.

> A good change is one that moves time forward without being conscious of it.

---

## Chapter 5: Tone selection and rhythm perception

Even if the arrangement is the same, if the timbre changes, the perception of rhythm will change.

### Case: Mix of short and long sounds

By combining a short kick and a long sub-bass, the beat and lingering sound are separated and depth is created.

### Case: Division of roles by frequency band

The low range fixes the beat, and the high range shows the flow. When this division of labor breaks down, the rhythm feels unstable.

> Tone is not an ornament, but the structure of time itself.

---

## Chapter 6: Polyrhythm and phase design

The overlapping of multiple cycles makes the rhythm three-dimensional.

### Case: 3 vs 4 step arrangement

Placing a pattern with a 12-step cycle 16 steps above creates a structure that constantly shifts.

### Case: Phase-shifting loop

By layering the same pattern one step later, a new rhythm is perceived due to interference.

> Rhythmic depth is created by the simultaneous existence of multiple times.

---

## Chapter 7: Tempo is a relative value

Tempo is a numerical value, but the experience is designed.

### Case: BPM constant/perception change

Even with the same 120 BPM, if you emphasize the backbeat, it will feel faster, and if you widen the interval, it will feel slower.

> Tempo is not a numerical value, but a perceptual design result.

---

## Chapter 8: Sample-based and step-based design theory

Sample-based design includes temporal information in the sound itself. Step-based design, on the other hand, defines time first.

### Case: Breakbeat extraction

By rearranging existing loops, you can redesign the structure while preserving the original groove.

### Case: Complete step reconstruction

By arranging it from scratch, the time structure purely reflects the design philosophy.

> The idea of ​​rhythm design changes depending on whether it is material-driven or structure-driven.

---

## Chapter 9: Loop perception and psychological time

Even short loops change in length perceptually.

### Case: Termination obfuscation

By weakening the last note of the loop, you can no longer feel the break.

### Case: Extraperiodic accent

By placing strong sounds outside the period, the sense of time is stretched.

> Psychological time is designed separately from physical time.

---

## Chapter 10: Cross-genre rhythm design comparison

### Techno

Immersive design with repeatability and minute changes. While maintaining the homogeneity of the 16 steps, time is varied with tones and accents.

### Hip Hop

Emphasis on backbeats and fluctuations derived from samples. The texture of the loop takes priority over the grid.

### IDM

Structural complexity and asymmetric design. Discrepancies in the period and irregular time signatures disturb the sense of time.

> Genre is a collection of rhythm design ideas.

## Chapter 11: DAW Interface and Thinking Style

The design philosophy of rhythm programming is greatly influenced by the interface used. MPC, TR-type step sequencers, and piano rolls each assume a different view of time.

### MPC Thinking: Reconnecting Pads and Body

The MPC is designed to bring a physical sense of performance to programming through 16 pads. The strength and timing of keystrokes are input as physical sensations rather than numerical values.

In this way of thinking, the grid is subject to post-processing, and the rhythm is played first and then organized.

### TR thinking: Visualizing steps and structures

TR sequencers explicitly divide time into equal steps. Since you can see at a glance where there is sound and where there is blank space, placement and omission are the main criteria for judgment.

Here, structure takes precedence over playability, and rhythms are constructed logically.

### Piano Roll Thinking: Abstracted Time Manipulation

Piano Roll handles pitch and time on the same plane. Rhythms are visualized as lines, and their length and overlap can be directly manipulated.

In this way of thinking, time is completely abstracted and the designer's intentions are immediately reflected.

### Mini section: 16 steps thinking difference for the same task

Assuming the same conditions, assume a basic beat of 4/4 16 step kick and snare only.

With MPC thinking, you first strike naturally with the pad, and then adjust the deviation and strength later. The finished product will be a physical moment with slight fluctuations.

In TR thinking, first place the kick on the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th steps, and the snare on the 5th and 13th steps, and consider omissions and accents as necessary. The finished product will have a clear structure and time arrangement.

In piano roll thinking, you visually align the starting points and lengths of the notes, but intentionally move some of them forward or backward. The completed form will be a time structure that visualizes the design intent as it is.

Even with the same 16 steps, if your starting point is different, the texture of the completed rhythm will vary greatly.

> The interface is a type of thinking, not a method of rhythmic input.

## Chapter 12: Rhythm thinking by designer type

Differences in rhythm programming arise from the designer's thinking type rather than technical differences.

### Performance pattern designer

He is the type who constructs rhythms based on his physical sensations, and the deviations and dynamics arise spontaneously. It goes well with MPC thinking.

### Structural Designer

View time as a block and construct a rhythm through placement and omission. Highly compatible with TR-type step thinking.

### Abstract Designer

Treat time completely as a design object and determine the structure through visual manipulation. Based on piano roll thinking.

One type is not better than the other. The important thing is to be aware of your own thinking style and switch depending on your goals.

> Rhythm design is not a technical choice but a thinking choice.

## Final chapter: Thoughts on rhythm design

Rhythm programming is not a matter of arranging sounds. This is the act of designing an experience based on how the auditory sense of time is perceived.

Even as technology evolves, this essence remains the same. Rhythm is not the sound that is being played, but rather the structure itself, including the time when it is not playing.

> Rhythm programming is the idea of ​​designing time when you can't hear.
