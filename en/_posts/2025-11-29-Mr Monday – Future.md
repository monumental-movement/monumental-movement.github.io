---


""Future"' was released in 1990 on Judge Jules and Roy The Roache"s fledgling label Elevation Inc Recordings.

Although this song attracted attention as a mega-rave anthem, only a small number of copies were sold in stores due to troubles associated with starting the label and the bankruptcy of the distribution company. As a result, it became a rare record among DJs, and DJs like Tony Humphries continued to play it at the end of their sets for many years, cementing its status as a classic.
