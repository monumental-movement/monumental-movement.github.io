“Toco – Guarapiranga” is a song/EP work by Toco (Tomaz di Cunto), a singer-songwriter based in Florence, Italy.

The ``Dub'' version of the EP (Gerardo Frisina Dub) is a club/dancefloor mix with an emphasis on rhythm and spatial effects, with a tempo of around 120 bpm.

"Remix" is an arrangement that maintains a more Brazilian rhythm while still retaining a jazz structure, and is a reinterpretation of the characteristics of the original.The original mix has a relatively restrained composition, and a sound composition that brings Brazilian musical elements such as singing and guitar/percussion instruments to the fore.
