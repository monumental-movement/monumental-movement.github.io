## Prologue: A world of sounds that fills the forest

Text: mmr｜Theme: Music culture is not a fixed heritage, but has been inherited while changing forms in response to changes in the environment and society.

The Amazon River Basin is one of the most culturally diverse regions in the world. Hundreds of indigenous groups have lived together, each with their own distinct languages, myths, and social structures. In this context, music has developed not as an independent form of entertainment or art, but as an act that is inseparable from life itself.

Songs are sung to pray for success in hunting and farming, and dances mark seasonal cycles and milestones in growth. Music is not something you listen to, but something you do, and it is also an act that confirms your membership in a community. Silence is almost nonexistent in the Amazon forest. Birds, insects, wind, and water all make sounds, and human music is also placed on this continuum.

> Amazonian indigenous music has existed as an act that dissolves the boundaries between nature and humans.

## Social structure and the role of music



In many Amazonian indigenous societies, music has a distinct social role. Who sings which songs and when is strictly regulated, and the musical acts permitted vary depending on age, gender, and social status.

Certain ceremonial songs are known only to elders, and their melodies are passed down orally from generation to generation. On the other hand, the songs that accompany group dances are shared by the entire community and become engraved on the body through repetition. Musical knowledge is not something that can be taught; it is something that can be acquired naturally in everyday life.

Music also plays a role in maintaining order within a community. The progress of the ritual is controlled by music, and when the song ends, the next act begins. Time itself is divided by sound.

> Music is a device that visualizes the structure of society and fixes the order of the community in the form of sound.

## Melody and rhythm as imitation of nature


In Amazonian indigenous music, many of the melodies and rhythms are directly influenced by the natural environment. The sounds of birds, the footsteps of animals, and the rhythm of rain are directly incorporated into musical materials.

Melodies are often composed of short repetitions of phrases, and are not intended to develop or resolve as in Western music. The structure, which does not have a clear end, reflects the sense of a continuous space in the forest. The rhythm is also not metrical, but cyclical and contains fluctuations.

These musics do not "describe" nature. This is an act to reaffirm that humans exist as a part of nature.

> Imitating the sounds of the forest means standing on the same level of existence as nature.

## Symbolism of instrumentation and materials


The instruments used are made from materials obtained from the surrounding environment. The main materials are wood, bamboo, bone, seeds, shells, and clay, each with specific symbolism.

The flute is one of the most important musical instruments, and is often said to reproduce the voices of mythical beings or ancestors. Taiko drums serve as the basis for dances and marches, and serve to unify the movement of the community. Shakers are associated with rain and fertility and are an essential part of rituals.

For some instruments, it may not even be possible to see them; only the sound is allowed. Music has meaning in a realm that goes beyond visual information.

>The sound of musical instruments itself has been regarded as a manifestation of spiritual beings.

## Ritual music and consciousness transformation


Rites of passage and healing use long, repetitive songs and rhythms. These changes the participants' state of consciousness and shift them from the everyday world to ritual time.

Shamans communicate with spirits through song and seek out the causes of illness and illness. Lyrics are often symbolic and have no direct meaning. What is important is not the content of the words, but the vibration and repetition of the sound itself.

Music is a therapy, a medium, and a technique for crossing boundaries.

> Ritual music is a means of traversing the layers of the world through sound.

---

## Integration of mythology, language, and music


In Amazonian indigenous societies, myths are often told in songs. Specific melodies are associated with specific stories, and when sung, past events are recreated in the present.

In a society without written materials, music functions as a memory device. Forgetting the melody is synonymous with losing the story. The language itself is melodic, and the boundaries between spoken words and songs are blurred.

Music, language, and mythology are not separate elements, but exist as a single system.

> Songs are myths told, and music becomes history itself.

## Chronology: Changes in music culture


* BC: Each region developed its own ritual music system.
* 16th century: Contact with religious musical ideas due to the arrival of outside forces
* 19th century: Missionary activities restrict some musical practices
* Late 20th century: Systematic recording through ethnomusicology progresses

## Contact with external cultures and selective transformation


Contact with outside cultures resulted in reorganization rather than rupture. New instruments and melodies were incorporated into the existing system, while elements that did not align with the community's values ​​were eliminated.

Music has always prioritized meaning within the community. Change is not passive, but the result of active choice.

>Transformation has functioned as a strategy for continuity rather than loss.

## Inheritance and practice in modern times


Currently, many indigenous peoples use audio recordings and videos to record their musical culture and use it for education and cultural inheritance. Music has also become a symbol of asserting cultural independence and land rights.

At the same time, there is a strong sense of caution against commercial use that has lost its context. Music continues to be an act of living within a community.

> Music is not a legacy of the past, but an ongoing cultural practice.

---

## Conclusion: The time the forest continues to play


Amazonian indigenous music is an integrative system that connects the natural, social, and spiritual worlds. It is not a fixed form and has continued to change with the environment.

As long as forests exist and people live there, the music will continue to play.

> Amazon's music is a culture that echoes time itself.
