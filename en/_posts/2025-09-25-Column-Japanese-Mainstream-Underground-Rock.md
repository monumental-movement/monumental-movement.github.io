## Double structure of Japanese rock history: front stage and underground water vein

Text: mmr｜Theme: Mainstream and underground Japanese rock

Japanese rock began to spread with [Group Sounds (GS)] (https://amzn.to/4gP5wli), which blossomed in the 1960s. However, at the same time, a trend of ""underground rock"' with an experimental spirit and destructive energy was born, separate from the public stage. Naked Larry"s, Keiji Haino, Boredoms, Acid Mother"s Temple, and others helped make Japan"s noise rock and psychedelic scene known internationally.
