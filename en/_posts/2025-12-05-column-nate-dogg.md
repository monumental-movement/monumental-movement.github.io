## Introduction: The "voice" at the center of G-Funk

Text: mmr｜Theme: The voice, groove, and legacy at the heart of West Coast hip-hop

There are a number of elements that characterize American West Coast hip-hop in the 1990s.
Dr. Dre production, P-Funk-inspired synth swells, thick bass lines, and smooth mellowness.
But the voice of **Nate Dogg (real name Nathaniel Dwayne Hale, 1969-2011)** has special meaning.

His singing voice is neither rap nor R&B, but something in between, yet different from both.
The dry texture and depth of the bass, the thickness and smoothness derived from gospel music. He has revolutionized the role that "songs" can play in hip-hop, and continues to influence many artists to this day.

Above all, he became recognized as an artist who was stronger than anyone else when he could sing the hook, and was sought after by almost everyone in the West Coast scene at the time.

## 1. Early life and roots: Gospel and Long Beach

Nate Dogg was born on August 19, 1969 in Clarksdale, Mississippi.
Clarksdale is known as the historic center of the blues, and some of his musical roots can be traced here.

As a child, he moved with his family to **Long Beach, California**.
It was here that he met the friends who would later support him throughout his career: Snoop Dogg and Warren G**.
All three had experience singing in church, and Nate Dogg in particular had extensive experience in **gospel choir**.

This foundation of gospel singing had a decisive influence on his later style.
Although her voice was linear with little vibrato, it had a deep resonance and a sense of rhythm that was naturally ingrained in her body.

### Joining the Marines

After graduating high school, Nate Dogg **enlisted in the US Marine Corps** and was discharged after serving for about three years.
This experience changed his life circumstances, but it was also a period that essentially forced him to return to Long Beach and music.

His participation at this time was almost like a debut, but he already had an established presence.
