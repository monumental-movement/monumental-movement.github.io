DHS (Dimensional Holofonic Sound) is a project by producer Benjamin Stokes, known for its unique sound and innovative approach to electronic music.

Since 1988, DHS has been creating music, visuals, and live shows.

This EP is a collection of selected DHS tracks, and is a wonderful EP that includes special versions of DHS's pioneering style, musical diversity, and evolution.

The full-size LP was never pressed, so this is the only way these songs are available on vinyl.

A fusion of electro and breakbeat, with a very distinctive funky synchronicity that can be seen throughout the album and in other works by Ben Stokes.

Due to demand and rising prices, this record is expensive, but compared to a record with just one good song, it's well worth it.

This EP, or mini-album, is top-notch from start to finish, with no wasted songs and absolutely full of killer tunes.
