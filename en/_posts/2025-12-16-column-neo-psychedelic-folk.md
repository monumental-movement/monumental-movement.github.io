## Prologue: Recursive psychedelia and folk updates

Text: mmr｜Theme: Not a genre that preserves the psychedelia of the past, but an editorial practice that renews perceptual experiences.

Neo-Psychedelic Folk is a musical trend that has been reconstructed using recording technology, visual sensibilities, and rhythmic concepts since the 2000s, while referring to the aesthetics of psychedelic folk and acid folk from the 1960s and 1970s. It is characterized by its active use of studio processing, editing, and electronic effects, while building on folk-derived acoustic textures, ethnic melodies, and repetitive chord progressions.

This trend was not limited to a specific geography or a single scene, but was formed intermittently across North America, Oceania, and Europe. The prevalence of DIY culture, indie labels, and digital recording environments has influenced all stages of production, distribution, and reception, making it a crucial difference from traditional folk renewal movements.

## Chapter 1: Historical Assumptions - Continuity from Psychedelic Folk

### 1-1. Base layer in the 1960s and 1970s

In the late 1960s, folk connected with rock, acquiring altered consciousness, mythological themes, and expanded song structures. The focus was on acoustic guitar, drone, handclaps, and chorus, and the performance was not necessarily aimed at technique.

Due to the limitations of recording technology, the psychedelic folk of this period relied on spatial expression and repetition through the performance itself. As a result, the acoustics are simple, but the group and ritual are emphasized.

### 1-2. Re-evaluation since the 1990s

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, acid folk and psychedelic folk were reevaluated as reissues and archives were dug up. This allows younger generations of musicians to begin absorbing these as historical reference points.

What is important is that it is not just a restoration, but a reinterpretation in an environment with increased freedom in recording and editing.

> "Historical sources are cited, but acoustic reproduction is not the goal."

## Chapter 2: Defining Characteristics of Neo-Psychedelic Folk

### 2-1. Musical structure

Neo-Psychedelic Folk's songs have structural tendencies such as repeating short motifs, diluting the clear A-melody/B-melody structure, blurring the melody with collective choruses, and fluctuations in tonality. These are not the simplification of traditional folk, but are created through multilayering through editing.

### 2-2. Acoustic processing

Spatial expansion using reverb and delay, pitch fluctuations that mimic tape-like fluctuations, and a mixture of lo-fi and hi-fi are used. Recordings were made at home or in a makeshift studio, and the unevenness of the sound quality was treated as an aesthetic in itself.

> "Fragmentation of experience is valued over homogeneity"

---

## Chapter 3: Animal Collective - Reorganization of collectiveness and perception

### 3-1. Organization and production attitude

Animal Collective was characterized by the fluidity of the members' roles rather than a fixed band composition. Percussion instruments, samplers, acoustic instruments, and voices are placed equally, and there is no central lead instrument.

### 3-2. Acoustic characteristics

Treating the voice as the main instrument, layering multi-layered choruses and circulating rhythms obscure the sense of time. Folk melodies are deconstructed and reconstructed as acoustic collages.

### 3-3. Connection with visual sense

Visual expressions avoid clear narratives and are structured around color, repetition, and abstract forms. This is the same structure as the song structure, and the visual sense also functions as an extension of the sound.

> "Visibility is not an explanation of a song, but a parallel sensory layer."

---

## Chapter 4: Tame Impala's early works - introspective psychedelia

### 4-1. Folk attitude as an individual production

Tame Impala's early works were almost entirely personal productions. Overdub recording, self-production, and limited equipment resulted in an introspective feel.

### 4-2. Fork element conversion

It is characterized by a simple chord progression, a melody-driven structure, and an arrangement that avoids over-emphasizing rhythm. While retaining the simplicity of folk music, acoustic processing gives it a psychedelic depth.

### 4-3. Characteristics of initial sound image

These include the rounded sound image of the drums, the phasing of the guitar, and the buried vocals.

> "Sound image design that presents one's inner self as a distant view"

---

## Chapter 5: Visual commentary - Visual language of Neo-Psychedelic Folk

Abstraction and natural motifs, loops, slow motion, and asynchronous cuts are often used. The video editing synchronizes with the repetitive structure of the song and serves to expand the sense of time.

---

## Chapter 6: Acoustic Explanation - Thoughts on Recording and Mixing

Emphasis is placed on a sense of envelopment rather than clarity of localization, and the sound image is not concentrated in the center but spreads out like a mist. Ambient sounds, distortion, and bleed are not removed and remain as part of the song.

> "A recording is an event, not a record."

## Chapter 9: Redefining rhythm and physicality

Rhythm in Neo-Psychedelic Folk acts on the body in a way different from the physical drive of dance music. Emphasis on clear beats is avoided, and periodic yet amorphous repetitions are used. As a result, the listener's body is not "moved" but placed in a state of "drifting."

> "Rhythm is not a motor command, but a framework for maintaining fluctuations in perception."

In Animal Collective"s early works, percussion and handclaps provide a steady sense of beat, but the jumble of voices obscures the center of gravity. In Tame Impala"s early works, the drums are placed in the background, maintaining periodicity but reducing physical tension.

---

## Chapter 10: Treatment of voices and folk collectiveness

Voice is one of the most important elements in Neo-Psychedelic Folk. The division of roles between lead vocalist and accompaniment is weakened, and multiple voices are placed in the same line. Vocal quality, overlap, and reverberation are prioritized over the clarity of lyrics.

This is the result of transferring the group singing nature of folk music to the studio space.

> "Songs are not a device to tell a story, but a material that fills a space."

---

## Chapter 11: Chord progression and tonality manipulation

Neo-Psychedelic Folk uses a lot of the simple chord progressions found in traditional folk, but they don't aim for linear solutions. By staying on the same chord for a long time, or by making ambiguous key changes, the tonality is not fixed.

In Tame Impala's early works, the boundaries between major and minor are blurred, and emotions do not converge into a specific emotion.

> "Emotions are presented, but interpretations are not fixed."

---

## Chapter 12: Production environment and technology

A change in the production environment was essential for the establishment of Neo-Psychedelic Folk. The proliferation of inexpensive recording equipment, DAWs, and plug-ins has made it possible for individuals and small groups to experiment over long periods of time.

In this environment, the boundaries between production and editing become blurred. The songs are presented with a history of editing, rather than a finished product. ["Completion is just the moment you stop editing"]

---

## Chapter 13: Perspective as a methodology

Neo-Psychedelic Folk is positioned as a methodology rather than a genre. What is important is not a specific sound image, but an attitude that reorganizes the relationships between sound and image, the body and perception.

From this perspective, Animal Collective and Tame Impala's early works are reference points, not objects of imitation.

> "References are made for updating, not fixation"

---

## Chapter 14: Interpenetration of video and sound

The images do not serve as a supplement to the music, but as an equivalent layer. In Neo-Psychedelic Folk-style videos, the editing points often do not match the beat of the music, and the synchronization between vision and hearing is intentionally shifted.

This discrepancy does not hinder immersion, but has the effect of sustaining perception.

---

## Chapter 15: Genre crossing and influence relationships

Neo-Psychedelic Folk has interacted with dream pop, experimental pop, ambient, and post-rock. However, the difference between them lies in folk-like simplicity and adherence to groupness.

---

## Final chapter

Neo-Psychedelic Folk is not a genre that preserves the psychedelia of the past, but an editorial practice that renews perceptual experiences. The collective sound of Animal Collective and the introspectiveness of Tame Impala's early works are the result of a folk simplicity combined with a contemporary production environment.

This trend is not understood as a completed style, but as a body in motion that is constantly being reconfigured.

> "This music ends its role the moment it is fixed."
