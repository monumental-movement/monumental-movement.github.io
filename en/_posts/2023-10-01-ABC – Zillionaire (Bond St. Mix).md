ABC is a pop band formed in Sheffield, England in 1980, best known for their 1980s songs such as "The Look of Love" and "When Smokey Sings." Since 1997, ABC has been a solo project by singer and founder Martin Fry, collaborating with various musicians.

Frye hired Trevor Horn as producer to move in a pop-oriented direction and renamed the group ABC.

ABC released their first single, "Tears Are Not Enough", in November 1981, reaching number 19 on the UK charts.
