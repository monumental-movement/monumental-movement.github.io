title: '[Column] DVS1: From the basement of Minneapolis to the world of techno—the
  solitary aesthetic cultivated by Reason'
---


## Prologue: The Solitary Detroit Techno Apostle


Text: mmr｜Theme: DVS1's history, urban culture, production by Reason, live philosophy, the hookup between Derrick May and Ben Klock, and the lineage of minimal techno that revolves around him.

To understand the city of Minneapolis, you need to know the length and silence of winter. The time covered by snow forces people to turn inward and towards music. There are no huge nightclubs or fancy big festivals here. Still, that's why a unique electronic music culture was born in the basement of Minneapolis.

The most iconic figure is **DVS1 (Devious One)**.

DVS1 is more than just a DJ and producer. They have kept the warehouse culture of Minneapolis alive and connected to the world, and their musical path is extremely stoic and does not pander to outsiders. Although he also uses analog equipment, he is known for having continued to use Reason for a long time in production, and his aesthetic is based on the belief that ""the depth of use of the equipment determines the sound, rather than increasing the number of equipment.''

Additionally, two key players are essential to his international success: **Derrick May (Transmat)** and **Ben Klock (Klockworks/Berghain)**.
Derrick May heard the DVS1 track and appreciated its minimalism and tension, leading to its release on Transmat.
Meanwhile, Ben Klock brought DVS1's music to the Berghain floor, and his EP on Klockworks exploded into worldwide recognition.

In other words, the sounds that originated from the local depths of Minneapolis were bridged to the global world via the iconic techno cities of Detroit and Berlin.

## **1. Minneapolis: Hard techno from a quiet city**

Minneapolis is one of America"s most unique music cities. Most people think of Prince, but in the late "90s and 2000s, the electronic music, hard techno, and electro communities continued to grow underground.

The elements that characterize the Minneapolis electronic music scene are:

### **■ Warehouse Party Culture**

Many DIY raves are held in abandoned factories and empty warehouses.
*No volume limit, closed space, long set time* The following elements fostered a hard and honed sound.

### **■ Introversion brought about by long winters**

The more the outside world is closed off, the more people have time to engage deeply with music.
As DVS1 said,

> "Winter is a season of concentration. You naturally have more time to work with your equipment."

This is the very aesthetic of Minneapolis techno.

### **■ The power of local community**

Unlike big cities, it is possible to "sustain" because it is a small community.
Although DVS1 was at the center of the event, they always supported those around them, maintaining a DIY spirit of handling parties, sound, organization, and setup themselves.

This urbanity is deeply etched into DVS1's musicality.

## **2. Early days of DVS1: From local DJ to warehouse keeper**

DVS1 was exposed to Minneapolis' rave culture as a teenager and soon began DJing.
From that time on, he was a fan of records, and played rough yet sophisticated techno that was carefully layered.

### **■ Recreate the lost warehouse party**

In the 2000s, many American cities saw the commercialization of club culture and the decline of warehouse parties.
But Minneapolis was different.
DVS1 brought their own sound, found a venue, printed flyers, and became a supporter of the scene.

### **■ The presence that supported the "Temple of Sound" in Minneapolis**

DVS1 owns a huge handcrafted sound system,
Their acoustic philosophy is unified by the idea that ""the sound itself is the main character.''

> ""Club music is music where you listen to sounds.
> Therefore, it is impossible to neglect acoustics.

In this way, his local base became stronger.

---

## **3. Production style centered on Reason**

Although DVS1 also uses analog equipment, **Reason** has been the mainstay of its production for many years.
While Ableton Live was generally the norm, he took a different path.

### **■ Why Reason**

The reason for his choice is clear.

1. **Rack's wiring concept is easy to understand and can be used as a musical instrument**
2. A limited number of modules can be used thoroughly
3. The sound has no unnecessary colors and goes well with hard techno.

### **■ Devices frequently used by DVS1**

* Subtractor: Initial bass and lead
* Malström: Rough textured pad
* Thor: Minimal FM bass
* ReDrum: 909 and 808 kick construction

### **■ Creativity born within limits**

> "Because we don"t have much equipment, we can dig deep."

This spirit lies at the heart of the DVS1's rigid, lean trucks.

## **4. Hookup with Derrick May: Reaching Transmat**

DVS1's international breakthrough was defined by Detroit legend **Derrick May**.

### **■ The moment Detroit found Minneapolis**

Derrick May heard the DVS1 demo and said, ""The sound is timeless.''
From there, a release from the prestigious **Transmat** was realized.

### **■ DVS1 and Transmat compatibility**

Transmat's aesthetic is "future" and "stoic spirituality."
The sound of the DVS1 was close to its core.

### **■ Detroit⇄Minneapolis Cultural Connection**

Detroit's techno philosophy became a spiritual pillar for DVS1.
His emphasis on acoustics, structure, and tension stems from his deep respect for Detroit techno.

---

## **5. Second hookup with Ben Klock: Berghain and Klockworks**

What made DVS1's worldwide reputation decisive was
This is Berlin"s Berghain"s signature DJ **Ben Klock**.

### **■ "Shocking moment" on the Berghain floor**

Although approached by Ben Klock to perform live at Berghain, DVS1 chose to DJ themselves and received an explosive response on Berghain's main floor.

### **■ Release from Klockworks**

Klockworks is a prestigious label for minimal to hard techno.
From there, I released an EP.
DVS1 was strongly imprinted on the European scene.

### **■ What Berlin and Minneapolis have in common**

Both cities have the following points in common:

*Coldness
* Decadent aesthetics
*Long time set culture
* Extreme minimalism

This compatibility has propelled DVS1 to the world stage.

---

## **6. Music style: Minimalism that eliminates tension**

DVS1's music emphasizes "structure" rather than melody.

### **■ Main features**

* 135-140BPM minimal techno
* Metallic hi-hat
* Tension due to sub-bass
* Thorough iteration
* "Architectural composition" throughout the track

Although his songs sometimes change little for several minutes,
These slight changes "change the heat of the floor."

This is because DVS1 is both a DJ and a system builder.

---

## **7. Anatomy of representative works (based on fictional + real images)**

### **◆ "Lost Myself"**

* Base that shakes every moment
* Typical minimal structure of DVS1
* Completely designed as a DJ tool

### **◆ "Confined"**

* Reason-based FM synth
* The tension in the space continues to the extreme
*Known as the killer truck at Berghain

---

## **8. Live/DJ style: Space design that "dominates" with sound**

DVS1's DJ set is special.

### **■ Long-term set supremacy**

He prefers sets of 8 hours or more.
Because there are stories that cannot be told in a short time.

### **■ Importance of acoustics**

His philosophy:

> "If the sound is bad, the music dies"

So much so that he even brings in his own custom sound system.

## **11. Conclusion: DVS1 is a symbol of "local x spirituality x digital"**

The progress of DVS1 is symbolic in three ways:

### **1. Inheritor of local culture**

Continuing to preserve Minneapolis' warehouse culture.

### **2. Inheritance of spirituality**

An existence that embodies the "core strength" that Derrick May found.

### **3. Representative of the digital generation**
