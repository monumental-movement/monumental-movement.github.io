## Prologue: Melody in Tears


Text: mmr｜Theme: Exploring the relationship between sadness and music from the perspectives of psychology, neuroscience, and cultural history

Why do people turn to music when they are sad?
The silence is often broken by a single note on the piano or a haunting singing voice.
This act is both intuitive and deeply scientific.
Music is a ""resonator'' of emotions and the only experience that can be shared in solitude.

In this paper, while crossing the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and cultural history,
We will explore the question, "Why do people listen to music when they are sad?"

## Chapter 1: Sadness and the Brain - Neural Resonance Structure

According to modern neuroscience, sadness is strongly associated with activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the brain.
By listening to music, these areas undergo "emotional restructuring" and
Encourages the process of objectively viewing one's own emotions.

Music is not just an external stimulus, but a ""mirror of nerves.''
When you listen to a sad melody, "sad neurons" resonate in your brain,
The feel-good chemical **dopamine** is secreted there.
This contradictory reaction—"pleasure in sadness"—is what
This is one of the biggest reasons why people seek out sad music.

## Chapter 2: Music as a device of empathy

According to psychologist Catherine Mercier,
""Music is a mimicking device for empathy.''
When listeners listen to sad music, they "identify" with the emotions of the composer and singer, and
Feeling the presence of others in loneliness.

This is a universal behavior from a cultural anthropological perspective.
Funerals, requiems, prayers, labor songs: Every culture has sounds that share sadness.
Music of sadness is an act that has a **community healing structure**.

## Chapter 3: Melody as a memory device

Music you listen to when you're sad often **plays back memories from the past**.
Psychologically, this is a phenomenon called "musical recall."
A certain melody evokes past scenes, smells, and the feel of a season.

People organize their memories during times of sadness.
Music is an "editing tool" for that purpose.
It functions as a **temporal medium** that connects memories and emotions.

> "Music is the only art that visualizes time"

## Chapter 4: "Sounds of sadness" from a cultural historical perspective

Music of sadness has existed in different forms with each era.
The chronology below shows the typical flow.

<div class="mermaid">

timeline
    title 悲しみと音楽の文化史（紀元前〜現代）
    BC500 : 古代ギリシャ「哀歌（threnos）」— 集団で悲しみを歌う儀式
    1600 : バロック期オペラ — 哀しみを芸術化する様式「ラメント」
    1820 : ロマン派音楽 — ショパン『葬送行進曲』に象徴される内面の表出
    1940 : ブルース／ゴスペル — 社会的苦痛を音に変える
    1970 : シンガーソングライター文化 — 個人の悲しみが詩となる
    1990 : グランジ／オルタナティヴ — 孤独を叫ぶ美学
    2020 : Lo-fi hiphop／エモラップ — デジタル孤独時代の新しい鎮魂歌


</div>

Looking at this trend, we can see that music of sadness has always existed as a mirror of society.
The pain of an individual is transformed into the voice of the times.

## Chapter 5: "Aesthetics of Sadness" in Japanese Culture

In Japan, there has been a concept called ""mono aware'' since ancient times.
This is an idea that does not deny sadness, but rather affirms it as a ""beautiful emotion.''
From gagaku's ""Ettenraku'' to the narration of biwa priests, and even enka,
Music in Japanese culture consistently contains a sense of sadness.

Listening to sad music has functioned as an emotional cleansing ritual.
Crying is not a sign of weakness, but an act of emotional social reconnection.

## Chapter 6: "Sharing Grief" in the Digital Age

In Spotify and YouTube playlists,
It is flooded with tags such as "Sad Songs," "Rainy Mood," and "Breakup Song."
The algorithm even learns your tendency to feel sad,
We propose the optimal "tears BGM".

This phenomenon can also be called **Platformization of personal feelings**.
In an anonymous space, people exchange ""quiet empathy'' through sound.

    D --> E[Cycle of empathy and approval]

Sadness is no longer closed,
It has become a **digital emotion** that resonates through the network.

## Chapter 7: The intersection of science and art - reproduction through sound

Since the 2020s, "**music therapy**" has been reevaluated in the field of clinical psychology.
Music has been scientifically proven to have an impact on emotional recovery during the treatment of patients with depression.

- Relaxation effect due to increase in alpha waves

- Heart rate variability (HRV) stability

- Externalization of emotions that are difficult to verbalize

Music is a "reset button for the mind" and at the same time,
It is also a "translator" of emotions.

## Final chapter: Kindness in the sound

Listening to music when people are sad
It's not to escape your emotions, but to **regain yourself**.

Shedding tears in the melody,
Regain your breathing in the rhythm,
Achieving "reconnection with the world" beyond words.

Music is a medium that turns sadness into love.

| Emotional state | Main brain regions | Influenced musical elements | Physiological responses |
| ---- | -------- | --------------- | -------- |
| Sadness | Amygdala/Insular Cortex | Slow tempo, minor chord | Lacrimal gland stimulation, slow heart rate |
| Relief | Prefrontal cortex/nucleus accumbens | Gentle harmony | Stable breathing, increase in alpha waves |
| Empathy | Medial prefrontal cortex | Vocal-centered structure | Oxytocin secretion |
| Regeneration | Cingulate Cortex | Crescendo Structure | Dopamine Rise |

>To listen to the sound of your own heart in the depths of that silence. "
