Stock, Hausen & Walkman (Stock, Hausen & Walkman) is a UK sampling collage music unit representing the 90s.

The band's name, Stock, Hausen & Walkman (1991-2001), is a play on electronic music pioneer Karlheinz Stockhausen, '80s mass-produced pop artist Stock Aitken Waterman, and Sony's Walkman.

When they first formed in the late 1980s, they were an experimental improvisational duo consisting of Matt Wand (the band's godfather and founder) and guitarist Rex Caswell.

During their activities, cellist Dan Weaver and drummers Richard Harrison and Andrew Sharpley participated in live performances and in the studio. 

In 1990, he also appeared on ``Company Week'' at the request of Derek Bailey.

Even after Caswell moved to Denmark and Weaver took a break from recording due to dance and theater work, Wand continued to work and produced perhaps their most successful albums, Organ Transplants vol. 1 & 2. Sharpley also contributed musically. 

Wand founded and operated Hot Air Records to promote S,H&W records, and released a wide range of their own work as well as that of other artists on the label.

Currently, he continues to operate the label and plans, designs, and produces albums. 

Although the project ended in 2001, Wand continues to release "interesting" S, H&W archival material on Hot Air.
