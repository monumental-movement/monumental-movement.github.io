## 1. Origin and background

In the mid-1990s, jazz-funk and drum and bass were rapidly developing in the UK club scene. In this context, music with freer and irregular rhythms emerged as an offshoot of traditional four-on-the-floor house and jazz-funk. This formed the basis of the genre that would later be called Broken Beat.

- **Jazz-funk swing feel**: Complex chord progressions and odd time signature rhythms
- **Drum and bass and jungle rhythm complexity**: high-speed breakbeats and irregular snare placements
- **Fusion with hip-hop sampling culture**: Simultaneous use of live music and sampling

> "At that time, it wasn't just dancing or listening to music, it was more fun to feel the swing and groove that was born behind the rhythm."
> — Testimony of a London club DJ at the time

The fusion of this multi-layered sense of rhythm and jazz-like harmonies formed the core sound of Broken Beat.

## 2. Early major artists and labels

Broken Beat's early days feature core artists and labels.

- **Dego (4hero)**: While active as a member of 4hero, he also pursues elements of Broken Beat in his solo works. In particular, "Live in Tokyo" is characterized by the method of directly applying the feeling of live performance to club tracks.
- **IG Culture**: A pioneer of the Broken Beat style, which combines jazz-funk and soul. We expanded the genre with complex phrases on keyboards and synths.
- **Kaidi Tatham**: With her versatile keyboard performances and odd time signature rhythms, she played a role in expanding the range of genres.
- **2000Black**: Label and artist collective, home to the Broken Beat community. In addition to releases, there was also lively interaction at regular events.

## 3. Musical characteristics and song analysis

Broken Beat is more than just dance music, it is characterized by its combination of rhythmic complexity and soulful harmonies.

### 3.1 Rhythm

- Based on a 4/4 house beat, slightly shifting the position of the snare and hi-hat
- Irregular swings and odd time signatures are often used, and although it is suitable for dance, it also emphasizes the enjoyment of listening.

**Example: IG Culture "Give Me Time"**
- ""Floating feeling'' created by the hi-hat not always being an eighth note, but slightly off-center.
- The kick drum is asymmetrically placed, creating a complex groove in response to the snare.

### 3.2 Melody and Harmony

- Synths and keyboards that incorporate jazz chord progressions
- Fusion with soulful vocal phrases and sampling
- In Dego's "Live in Tokyo," piano and synth pads overlap to create a floating harmony.

### 3.3 Sampling and live performance techniques

- Use live recordings of drums and percussion as material
- Sample soul and funk phrases
- Programming techniques that reflect rhythm changes in real time
