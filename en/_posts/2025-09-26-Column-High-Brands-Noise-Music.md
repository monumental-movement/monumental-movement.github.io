## At first glance, the two seem unrelated.

Text: mmr｜Theme: The affinity between recent fashion shows and noise music

Noise music is all about underground live houses, sweat and feedback sounds, and extreme performances. High-end brands, on the other hand, are the runways of Paris, Milan, and Tokyo, shiny textiles, and the height of sophistication.
It is easy to think that the two cannot intersect.
However, if you look at fashion shows in recent years, you will find that the two have built a surprisingly close relationship.

### Intimacy between fashion show and noise

Since the 1990s, high-end brand shows have actively introduced not only rock and classical music, but also noise/industrial music.

[Balenciaga](https://amzn.to/3KItfr1) made industrial noise roar in a ruin-like space, presenting clothing and space as ""aggressive beauty.''

Rei Kawakubo of [COMME des GARÇONS](https://amzn.to/42fzNDE) has been drawn to experimental music since the 1980s, and has layered repetition and dissonance into fashion.

[Yohji Yamamoto](https://amzn.to/42cl0JT) alternated between tranquil classical music and roaring noise in his show, acoustically visualizing the "white space" and "excess" of clothing.

Noise becomes a device that emphasizes the dismantling of fashion's existing beauty through the ""denial of harmony.''

---

### Paradoxical affinity — anti-commercial becomes brand value

Noise originally developed as an antithesis to capitalism and commercial music. What Merzbow and Hijikadan embody is ""outside the framework of the music industry.''
But ironically, it's this "anti-commercial" attitude that makes it an attractive poison for brands.

Just as [Vivienne Westwood](https://amzn.to/46DRqyf) incorporated punk into capitalism, noise is also used as a ""foreign substance for brands to differentiate themselves.'' In other words, rebellion is transformed into a nourishing source of luxury.

---

### Anecdotes and specific episodes

The footage from [**Hijokaidan**](https://amzn.to/3IlDq4h) was used as a visual production material for a European fashion brand, emphasizing the ""coexistence of chaos and sophistication.''

[GUCCI](https://amzn.to/4gIXl9X) mixed industrial noise into the campaign video, intentionally creating a conflict with classical music.

[Rick Owens](https://amzn.to/3KGkWMm) introduced drone-like noises to his shows in the 2010s, lulling the audience into an "uncomfortable immersion."

[Yoji Yamamoto](https://amzn.to/4gN0be7) said in an interview, ""Clothing requires silence, but sometimes a roar that destroys that silence is useful.''

---

### Contemporary significance — noise to create instability

Fashion in the 21st century faces the risks of ""mass consumption" and ""high-speed circulation."
Therefore, noise emphasizes ""instability" and ""uniqueness" as a counter to homogenization.
Roars and noises make the audience uncomfortable and arouse, proving that the brand is a ""provocateur.''

### "Sound of fashion" from a noise artist"s perspective

From the noise/experimental music side, contact with high-end brands was also important.

[Merzbow](https://amzn.to/4mG80nl) (Japanese noise master)...While the themes are environmental issues and anti-consumption, it is paradoxically incorporated into luxury.

[Keiji Haino](https://amzn.to/4ntvDR6)...Like clothing, improvisation that "deconstructs form" resonates with designers.

[Throbbing Gristle](https://amzn.to/46nkrzq)...As the father of industrial, it is directly connected to the aesthetics of Balenciaga and Rick Owens.

[Ryoji Ikeda](https://amzn.to/4nqNCYt)…Data music and minimalism resonate with Prada's modernity.

[Fennesz](https://amzn.to/4mvo7DT), [Tim Hecker](https://amzn.to/46EZO0j)...Sounds between beauty and decay are chosen by Dior and Gucci.

[Sunn O)))](https://amzn.to/4mE03yK)…The ritualistic nature of drones fits into Rick Owens' worldview.

### summary

"High brand" and "noise music" seem to be unrelated at first glance.
However, both share an aesthetic that deconstructs and reconstructs beauty.
Noise tears apart the pretensions of luxury and paradoxically strengthens its brand value.
The roar that echoes on the runways of the 21st century is proof that brands are not ""existences to be consumed" but ""existences that provoke."
