## Prologue: The era of burgers that can be enjoyed with the ears


Text: mmr｜Theme: On the evolution of fast food music as a "culture that can be enjoyed with the ears"

The music of the hamburger shop is not just a commercial song, but a ""sound portrait of the times.''
What values ​​society sought and what tempo it lived in - all of these are condensed into a 15-second jingle and sound logo.

McDonald"s upbeat family pop, Burger King"s rebellious guitar riffs, and Mos Burger's handcrafted warmth from the ukulele.
Rather than corporate advertisements, these are the very ""aural memories of the times.''
