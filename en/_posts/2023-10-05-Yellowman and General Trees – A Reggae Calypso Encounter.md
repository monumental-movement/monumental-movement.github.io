Yellowman is a very popular dancehall reggae artist in the Jamaican music scene, and General Trees is a similarly well-known dancehall artist. Their collaboration ""A Reggae Calypso Encounter'' offers a unique sound that combines elements of Jamaican reggae and Trinidad and Tobago calypso.

The song alternates between Yellowman and General Trees, combining the rhythms of calypso with the energetic style of reggae. The lyrics of the song describe the atmosphere of a dance hall party scene or a calypso festival, with a fun atmosphere and dance rhythm.
