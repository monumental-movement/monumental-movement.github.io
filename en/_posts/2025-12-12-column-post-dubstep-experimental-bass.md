## Introduction: The context of "post-dubstep" born in London in the late 2000s

Text: mmr｜Theme: About the new bass culture born from urban reverberations

Post-Dubstep is a movement that expanded bass expression after dubstep, and was formed mainly in London in the late 2000s. Starting from the deep bass, dub-derived spatial processing, and garage rhythm structure of traditional dubstep, it is distinctive in that it has expanded into R&B, soul, experimental electronic music, ambient, and art-oriented beat music.

In South London (Croydon, Brixton, etc.), which was the center of early dubstep, there existed a ""dark sub-bass sound'' that was established through the DMZ party culture, but from around 2006 to 2009, young producers began to introduce more diverse elements. Representatives of this generation include **Burial**, **Mount Kimbie**, and **James Blake**, who later gained worldwide acclaim.

By incorporating not only club culture but also ""urban reverberations'' such as city noise, late-night traffic, cell phone recordings, and field recordings as sample materials, they created a new emotionality that was not present in conventional bass music.

## Chapter 1: Basic characteristics and acoustic approaches

### 1-1 Bass structure: Sub-Bass reverberation and reconstruction
Post-dubstep bass processing tends to have a "subdued attack" and "spatial breadth" compared to early dubstep.
Typical characteristics include:

- Focus on deep sub-bass between 40 and 60Hz
- Frequently used sine wave based
- Emphasizes subtle fluctuations in the volume envelope rather than LFO modulation
- Don't make the sub stereo, fix it in the center and spread the surroundings with field sound

### 1-2 Rhythm structure: 2-step transformation and polyrhythm
The beat is based on garage-derived **2-step**, but it also includes certain fluctuations and broken beats.

- Bass drum ranges from **110 to 130 BPM** instead of around 140
- Snare has a weak attack tone without emphasizing the backbeat
- Hats are often made from processed field recordings rather than metal.
- In addition to drum machines, you can use short samples such as the sound of small objects hitting, the sound of paper scraping, etc.

### 1-3 Acoustic space: reverberation, particleization, field recording
Post-dubstep can be described as a ""genre that creates space.'' In particular, the following elements are distinctive.

- Use London street noises (rain, car sounds, ticket gates touching, etc.) as samples
- Reproducing reflected sound in real space using Convolution Reverb
- Texturing of reverberation with Granular Synthesis
- Pauses of silence and noise affect the structure of the song

## Chapter 2: Analysis of major artists

## 2-1 Burial (Hyperdub)

Since his debut in 2006, Burial has been hailed as a central symbol of post-dubstep.
His most important characteristic is his ability to extract the feeling of loneliness in the city.

### Sound characteristics
- The vocal sample is extremely pitch-processed and contains multiple formants, giving it a "gender-indeterminate" feel.
- Bringing Vinyl Crackle (record noise) to the foreground
- The kick is a low attack like distant thunder in the middle of the night
- The snare has a dry sound quality, not metallic, but like "broken pieces of wood"
- Overall, a "foggy midrange" dominates, and the melody remains a short motif.
- Frequent use of short release pads that disappear quickly

### Sampling method
Burial's sampling is particularly distinctive, incorporating various noises as musical elements.

- Process train announcement sound and use it as a pad
- Convert nighttime rain recordings into particles to create rhythm material
- Composite game audio segments to form human nuances
- Cut the vocal fragment extremely short and give it a ghostly presence with reverse reverb processing

Through these methods, Burial's songs reconstructed "memories of the city outside of club music."

## 2-2 James Blake: Combining songwriting and experimental bass

James Blake is unique in taking post-dubstep out of the context of club culture and combining it with singer-songwriter expression.

### Acoustic characteristics
- Extreme minimalism centered around piano and vocals
- The bass is minimal and smoothly arranged around 50-70Hz.
- The chord progression has a classical harmonic feel.
- Suppress formant manipulation and blur the boundary between natural sounds and electronic sounds
- Depending on the depth of compression, "breathing" functions as the rhythm of the song

### Sampling example
- Cut your own voice short, pitch shift it, and convert it into a harmonic-rich pad
- Foreground piano pedal noise with compression
- Mix short pulse noise (click) in the low range and use it as a kick replacement

James Blake's approach has been treated as an important turning point, connecting ""experimental bass music" and ""introspective songwriting."

## Chapter 3: Sound Design Techniques Details

### 3-1 Processing field recordings
- Record London's environmental sounds (stations, buses, rain sounds)
- Emphasize 300-800Hz with EQ to create a "mid-range urban feel"
- Shorten the reverb and blur the contours of the space
- Set Grain Size from 10 to 70ms to form a misty texture

### 3-2 Vocal processing
- Extreme movement of Pitch-shift ±12 or more
- Independent adjustment of Formant-shift to make gender and age ambiguous
- By adding a short Reverse Reverb, it creates a texture like a "phantom image that approaches and disappears"
- There are many examples of using harmonizers to form dissonant harmonies.

### 3-3 Base generation
- Mainly sine waves
- Short envelope with Attack 5~20ms, Release 100~200ms
- Other layers are organized with HPF to keep low end clear below 60Hz
- The stereo spread is left to field recording, and the bass itself is monaural.

## Chapter 5: Expanding from Post-Dubstep to Experimental Bass

Since the 2010s, post-dubstep has expanded beyond just a genre derived from dubstep to include the broader concept of "Experimental Bass."

### Features
- The bass line is no longer the main character of the song, but an element of spatial structure.
- Introduction of ASMR-like microsounds
- Down tempo that loosely incorporates the structure of half tempo
- Hybrid sound image: fusion of R&B, contemporary music, and ambient music

### Changes in representative elements
- Early: London urban feel, fog texture
- Middle period: Vocal-based introspective expression
- Modern: Intersection with ASMR, environmental sounds, and minimal sound

## Chapter 6: Acoustic analysis examples (structure, frequency, materials)

### 6-1 Typical frequency band distribution
- 20~60Hz: Sine wave base
- 200~800Hz: Field recording/noise/vocal fragments
- 1~3kHz: Chirp sound, processed percussion
- 8~12kHz: Air feel, atomization noise

### 6-2 Song composition
- Avoid clear drops
- Structure that "disappears/appears" rather than repetition
- The boundary between rhythm and melody is vague

## Conclusion: Post-dubstep as the future of bass

Post-dubstep is more than just an evolution of dubstep, it is a movement that uses urban reverberations, field recordings, introspective vocals, and experimental electronic music to ""renew emotional expression using bass.''

Post-dubstep/Experimental Bass will continue to be a fertile ground for new sonic experiments, just as Burial translated the solitude of the city into sound and James Blake integrated the personal voice and electronic sounds.
