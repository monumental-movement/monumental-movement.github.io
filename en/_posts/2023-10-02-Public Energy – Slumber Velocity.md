title: Public Energy – Slumber Velocity
---


"Slumber" features a strong groove and a near-disappearing bass bass, giving way to a minimalistic trance melody before returning to a more intense sound. Additional acid drops are also laced throughout the track.

"Velocity", on the other hand, has a more European style and features drum rolls.
