## Prologue: A procession of sounds filling the road

Text: mmr｜Theme: The history and present of street culture where religion, politics, and community intersect, deciphered through Haitian festival music rara

The season has arrived on the dry land of Haiti, where sharp metal sounds and low, undulating drums overlap. Rara does not have a specific venue. Music moves along the roads, penetrates the villages, and transforms people's living spaces into stages. The group continues walking until dawn, accompanied by costumes, dances, and religious symbols. This music is not entertainment, but prayer, political statement, and history storyteller.

Lala is more than just carnival music. It is a culture where the timeline of Lent before Easter, the cosmology of the Voodoo faith, and the memories of colonial rule and revolution overlap, crystallizing in the sounds of the streets. This article traces the rara's origins, instrumentation, social functions, and modern transformations as an accumulation of facts.

> Lala is a collective memory device in the form of music, and a culture that continues to update history through walking.

## Chapter 1 Historical origins of Lala

The origin of lala is closely tied to the deep layers of Haitian society that was formed between the 18th and 19th centuries. In Saint-Domingue during the French colonial period, people brought from various parts of Africa maintained their own religious rituals and musical culture. Although these traditions were suppressed under plantation control, they were inherited in fragments through nightly gatherings and festivals.

After independence in 1804, Catholicism and African faiths mixed in Haiti and became systematized as Voodoo. Rara became established in this religious mix as an outdoor processional ritual, especially during Lent. It has been pointed out that the form of marching reflects the memory of forced displacement during the colonial period and the experience of armed uprisings during the revolutionary period.

The Rara procession was not simply a celebration, but had the clear purpose of offering to the spirits, calling out to the spirits of the ancestors, and affirming the unity of the community. Music developed as an integral part of walking, and was characterized by continuous rhythm without stopping.

> Lala was founded at the intersection of suppressed religious practices and post-revolutionary social restructuring.

## Chapter 2 Lala as a religious ritual

Lara is deeply connected to Voodoo beliefs. Many of the processions are dedicated to a specific loa (spirit), and each piece of music and rhythm is given a symbolic meaning. Participants not only play music, but also purify the path for spirits and receive blessings.

Ceremonial preparations are often made before the start of a march. After offerings, prayers, and calls from leaders, the group takes to the streets. Music is a means of communicating with spirits, and its volume and repetition function as elements that promote a trance state.

Religious aspects differ from region to region, and even within the same rara, the objects of dedication and the methods of dedication vary. This flexibility is one of the reasons why Lara has survived in such a wide area.

> Rara's religiosity is not a fixed doctrine, but a collection of practices that are updated with each march.

## Chapter 3 Instrumentation and Acoustic Structure

Lara's defining feature is the metal wind instrument vaksen. Long pipes made of bamboo or metal are blown, and multiple players play single notes to form a polyrhythm. Added to this are drums, maracas, and metal percussion instruments.

The vaxin is not so much a melodic instrument as a device for building layers of sound. Each player plays a different pitch and rhythm, creating an overall undulating sound. Music is not written into musical scores, but is inherited through physical memory.

> Rara's sound is created not as an individual performance, but as a collective breath.

---

## Chapter 4 Social and political functions

Lara has historically carried social commentary and political messages. Lyrics can include satire about current events or those in power, and the march itself can be a form of protest.

Under the dictatorship, Rara marches were sometimes subject to surveillance, but the music and celebration served as a way to express opinions while avoiding direct repression. The nature of street movement was important in avoiding censorship and control.

> Lala is a speaking device in public space, wearing a celebratory mask.

---

## Chapter 5 Regional differences and diversity

Even within Haiti, the style of rara varies greatly depending on the region. In urban areas, there is a tendency for the formations to become larger and louder. On the other hand, in rural areas, there is a strong religious ritual, and the relationships among the participants are close.

Rara is also inherited in immigrant communities, and marches held abroad function as a place for identity confirmation. The form changes depending on the environment and legal system, but the core of the combination of walking and music remains the same.

> Rara is not a single style, but a group of cultures that change form depending on the situation.

---

## Chapter 6 Lara in modern times

Modern-day Lala oscillates between traditional rituals, tourism, and the music industry. While recordings and stage productions have gained new audiences, it has also been pointed out that there is a danger that the essence of street marches will be lost.

Still, every year during Lent, Lara reappears on the streets. Even in situations where electricity and resources are limited, music can be created as long as the body and breath are present. This fact supports Lala's sustainability.

> Lala continues to be walking music, even as it adapts to modern times.

## Chapter 7 Spatial structure and physical sensation of marching

The essence of Lala is "movement". The performers and participants do not remain on a fixed stage, but pass through roads, intersections, village boundaries, and the vicinity of cemeteries. These spaces have a functional meaning in everyday life, but during the Rara period they take on a ceremonial meaning. The places through which the music passes are temporarily sanctified and become etched in the community's memory.

What is important in marching is acoustic continuity rather than visual order. Even if the ranks are disorganized, the march will continue as long as the sound does not break up. Participants rely on sound to determine their location and synchronize their bodies. For this reason, in Lara, hearing is more central to spatial recognition than line of sight.

## Chapter 8 Elements of body, fatigue, and duration

Lara lasts a long time. Marches have been recorded lasting from a few hours to overnight, and sometimes over multiple days. Although the performers take breaks, they basically keep walking, blowing, and tapping. Fatigue is inevitable, and sharing that limit becomes part of the ritual itself.

The physical demands are supported by the simplicity and repetitive nature of the music. This is why sustainable patterns are valued over complex melodies and advanced techniques. Music is not designed to overwork the body, but is optimized to be a form that the body can sustain.

> Lala's musical structure is designed on the premise that the body can continue walking.

---

## Chapter 9 Lyrics and Oral Tradition

Lara's lyrics are rarely written down and are passed down orally. The content is not fixed, and current events and local events are improvised. This makes Rara a living record that reflects the situation in that place that year.

The lyrics often use metaphors and allusions, and often avoid direct expression. This has functioned not only as a religious consideration but also as a response to political oppression. Meaning is deciphered through the shared knowledge of the participants.

> Lala's lyrics are a language that can only be fully understood within a community.

---

## Chapter 10 View and representation from the outside

Lala has attracted the attention of researchers and tourists from overseas, but its representation tends to be biased. In many cases, only musical exoticism and celebratory aspects are emphasized, and religious and political contexts are omitted.

This external gaze has also influenced Lara's self-understanding. While some groups have become more theatrical and have strengthened visual elements, there are also movements that continue to emphasize internal ritual aspects.

> Lara has always changed amidst the tension between the inner and outer gaze.

---

## Chapter 11 Reinterpretation as a music genre

Since the late 20th century, rara has been reinterpreted as a musical genre that is recorded and performed on stage. During this process, the instrumentation and song structure were sorted out, and the format of the music for listening was prepared.

However, the recorded Lala is only part of the original experience. Music, separated from walking, ambient sounds, and accidental events, cannot escape being a fragment of ritual.

> Lala is music that, even though it has been categorized as a genre, has not completely established itself.

---

## Chapter 12 Lala from a comparative perspective

There is a large amount of processional festival music in the Caribbean and African diaspora. While Lala has similarities with these, it remains unique in its particular seasonality and religious role.

Comparative studies emphasize marching, repetitive, and participatory structures, but Lala's case is characterized by a particularly high degree of political message connotation.

> Lala is a cultural form that can be compared but cannot be easily substituted.

---

## Final Chapter Music that continues to walk

Rara is a culture that has survived through practice rather than records. There are no music scores or fixed forms, and the sounds are updated through the body. When the march ends, the music disappears, only to reappear on the streets the following year.

This cycle is the core of Lala. A moment when history, religion, politics, and life come together and become visible as sound. Today, Lara continues to walk the streets of Haiti.

> Rather than repeating the past, Lara inscribes history in the present tense every time she walks.
