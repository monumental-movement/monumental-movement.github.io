## What happened in the Bay Area?

Text: mmr｜Theme: The intersection of machines, collage, and improvisation -- the history and recommended discography of noise/experimental music nurtured in the Bay Area



The Bay Area, centered around San Francisco and Oakland, is a subcultural testing ground and has provided a unique ""place for actual production'' for noise/experimental music. The stages and methods are diverse, such as performance art that foregrounded the DIY spirit of the 1970s and 1980s and the violence of machines and sound (e.g. Survival Research Laboratories), and groups that pushed tape collage/sampling culture to a popular level (e.g. Negativland). These activities led to live houses, art spaces, cassette/indie labels, and later festival culture.

### Key players and field ecology

#### Survival Research Laboratories (SRL)

SRL, known for its destructive mechanical performance, was founded in 1978 by Marc Poulin. The show, which used huge equipment and the sounds of fire, dust, and metal, clearly presented the "visibility" and "danger" of noise, and established the Bay Area as a "testing ground for sound and machinery." SRL's activities are praised not only for expressing acoustic noise, but also for their perspective on industrial technology.

#### Negativland

A group active in the San Francisco area and known for their media critical works that use sampling/collage. Works such as Escape From Noise from the late 1980s were important works that showed the intersection of noise and pop culture, attracting controversy and attention through DIY radio and fake advertising techniques.

#### Matmos and local derivation

Matmos was formed in San Francisco in the 1990s and gained international acclaim for their conceptual work that uses sampling. Since the 2000s, it has continued to lead the "conceptual side" of experimental music, strengthening its connections with art institutions and contemporary music festivals.

### Community and the field (Noise Pop, Bay Improviser, etc.)

The Bay Area is home to indie festivals like Noise Pop and improvisational/experimental music communities like Bay Improviser, which are responsible for passing down expressions and venues for younger generations. These scenes circulate through the venue of "live" and provide a platform where old and new intersect.

### Summary (now/future)

Noise/experimental music in the Bay Area is constantly being updated as an act of not only ""destruction" but also ""re-editing and critiquing." SRL"s mechanical theater, Negativland"s media criticism, Matmos' sound research—all have presented practices that go beyond music. Currently, a hybrid of digital distribution and local DIY is progressing, and Bandcamp and local festivals are supporting young artists. Listening and participating in the scene is the best way to understand this scene.
