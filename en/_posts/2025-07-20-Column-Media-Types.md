## Changes and comparisons of music media: Sales of records, cassettes, CDs, and MDs, frequency characteristics, future trends, and the emergence of Dolby Atmos

### Historical sales comparison of music media
Over the past few decades, music media has undergone rapid technological innovation and diversification. Here we will provide an overview of global sales estimates for the major physical media: records (analog LPs), cassette tapes, CDs, and MDs.

*Sales figures are estimates based on multiple sources, and there are regional and age differences.

### Differences in frequency characteristics and hearing

<hr>

#### Record (Analog LP)

Frequency characteristics: Approximately 20Hz to 20kHz (theoretical value)

Features: Feel the overtones, warmth, and natural distortion that are unique to analog. It is easily influenced by the condition of the needle and press quality, and there is a lot of noise.

Spectrogram trend:

High frequencies (15kHz~) are gradually attenuated

The low range is rich, but fluctuations may occur due to uneven rotation and stylus pressure.

Noise (crackling, siren) randomly distributed

Hearing style: Soft, smooth, and warm, with a tendency to accept noise and distortion as "taste."

<hr>

#### Cassette tape

Frequency characteristics: Approximately 30Hz to 12kHz for normal tape, approximately 30Hz to 18kHz for metal tape

Characteristics: Depends on the magnetic properties of the tape and the quality of the head. Sound quality is likely to deteriorate due to hiss and tape wear.

Spectrogram trend:

High range suddenly rolls off (especially normal tape)

Mid-low range is relatively stable

Hiss noise of about -50dB always spreads to high frequencies

Using Dolby NR reduces some high-frequency noise, but the roundness of the sound remains.

Hearing: Slightly muffled, with modest high frequencies. It's soft and warm, but the noise is noticeable.

<hr>

#### CD (compact disc)

Frequency characteristics: 20Hz to 20kHz (44.1kHz sampling)

Features: Digital sound source with low noise, flat and clear sound quality.

Spectrogram trend:

Frequency response is nearly flat up to 20kHz

Very low noise floor, almost no unnecessary sound components

Even sudden sounds are reproduced without distortion.

Hearing: Clear and high resolution, but analog warmth is often lacking.

<hr>

#### MD (Mini Disc)

Frequency response: 20Hz to 20kHz (with ATRAC compression)

Features: Sound quality is close to that of a CD, but due to the compression method some detailed information may be lost.

Spectrogram trend:

Low to mid range reproducibility close to CD

High frequency attenuates early around 17-18kHz (effect of data compression)

Transient components often appear "blurred"

Hearing: Almost clear, but compared to a CD it may feel a little compressed.

<hr>

### Current status and future trends of each media

<hr>

#### Records

Current situation: Globally, sales of analog records are steadily recovering, centered on vintage demand and sound quality-oriented demographics. Analogue regression is particularly noticeable among young people.

Future: A small but sustainable market is expected with the support of analog sound source enthusiasts. Hybrid products (analog + digital) are also available.

<hr>

#### Cassette tape

Current status: The once mainstream media has declined. Limited support among enthusiasts and indie scenes.

Future: Niche popularity as retro culture. It survives as part of DIY music and collections.

<hr>

#### CD

Current situation: Sales have decreased significantly due to the spread of streaming. There is still demand among certain groups (collectors and those who prefer high-quality sound).

Future: Although it is shrinking as a packaged media, the key is to differentiate it through physical ownership and added value (deluxe editions, etc.).

<hr>

#### MD

Current status: Almost disappeared from the market. A certain level of support in Japan is also a thing of the past.

In the future: It will only remain for a limited time for preservation or as a hobby.

### What is Dolby Atmos?

<hr>

#### Overview of Dolby Atmos

Dolby Atmos is an object-based 3D sound technology that goes beyond traditional channel-based surround sound and allows "sound objects" to be freely placed throughout a space.

Sound image placement in the height direction is possible

Dramatically improves the live feel and sense of presence of movies, games, and music

Can be played in home theaters, headphones, and smartphones

<hr>

#### Dolby Atmos in music production

In recent years, streaming services (Apple Music, Tidal, etc.) have started distributing music compatible with Dolby Atmos, and the music industry is gaining attention.

Provides a three-dimensional sound experience different from traditional stereo

Freely design the localization of vocals and instruments

Combined with high-resolution sound sources for a more immersive listening experience

<hr>

### Future music media trends and the potential of Dolby Atmos

<hr>

#### Changes in media

The transition from physical media to streaming is almost complete

The focus of the next generation is support for high quality sound distribution (high resolution, MQA) and spatial audio (Dolby Atmos, Sony 360 Reality Audio)

<hr>

#### Evolution of the experience

Users are moving from simply playing music to experiencing spatial sound

A complex market where analog regression and digital advancement coexist.

Dolby Atmos is highly anticipated as a new means of expression for live performances and festival experiences.

Spatial audio technologies such as Dolby Atmos are rapidly becoming popular as the "next revolution in music experience." The future of listening will continue to evolve from simply "listening" to "feeling as if you are actually there."
