Soundtrack of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie ``Tank Girl'' directed by Rachel Talalay, which was released in theaters in 1995. Tank Girl is a live-action adaptation of a comic that has a cult following in the UK. The soundtrack was assembled by Courtney Love, and SPK's Graeme Revell provided original music. Devo recorded a new version of "Girl U Want" for the movie because she was a big fan of the comic.
