## Historical prototype of the act of remixing

Text: mmr | Theme: Remix culture has rapidly expanded from the 20th to the 21st century, crossing over music, video, art, and internet expression. On the other hand, although the copyright system was developed to protect the rights of creators, it has always caused friction with cultural practices that are predicated on reuse, quotation, and modification. This paper takes the historical development of remix culture as a starting point, organizes the institutional characteristics of Japanese law, US law, and EU law, and examines the relationship between rights and creation from multiple angles, expanding the scope beyond music to include videos, memes, and derivative works.

Even before the word remix became popular, human culture has always been premised on reuse and modification. Works such as parodies of folk songs, variations on oral literature, and melodic adaptations of religious music were not fixed, finished products, but transformed during the process of transmission.

Even after the modern era, when the concept of musical notation and composers was established, variations, arrangements, and quotations have been regarded as legitimate creative acts. The themes and variations in classical music and the interpretation of standards in jazz show that the reconstruction of existing materials is at the heart of expression.

> Remixing is a cultural self-renewal device that predates modern copyright.

## Visualization of recording technology and reuse

With the spread of recording technology in the early 20th century, the object of reuse changed from "songs" to "sound sources." Through radio broadcasting, record duplication, and magnetic tape editing, materials began to circulate in a form separate from the act of performance.

Tape editing in particular formed the technical premise that was directly linked to later sampling and remixing. Editing through physical cutting and joining made the creator aware that the sound source was a material that could be disassembled.

> Technology has transformed reuse from an invisible practice to a visible operation.

## Jamaican Dub and Version Culture

Established in Jamaica in the late 1960s, dub established remixing as an independent production act. The method of creating new music by manipulating multi-tracks of existing reggae sound sources, deleting vocals, processing effects, and manipulating space dismantled the idea of ​​focusing on original songs.

The background to this was a production environment that made the most of limited resources and immediate competition in sound system culture. Rights processing relied more on practice than on institutions, and reuse was a routine assumption.

> Dub was the first systematic practice that put re-editing at the core of its creation.

## Expanding Hip Hop and Sampling

Born in New York in the late 1970s, hip-hop brought remix culture to the center of urban culture through sampling. The repetition of breakbeats and the fragmentary quotation of existing sound sources separated music production from professional education and transformed it into a practice based on equipment and sensation.

In the early days of hip-hop, there was little awareness of rights handling. Once the scale of distribution expands and connections are made with major industries, legal issues become apparent.

> Sampling exposed points where cultural references collide with economics.

## Basic structure of the copyright system

The copyright system aims to promote creative activities by granting exclusive rights to creators. The rights to reproduction, adaptation, and public transmission are central, and remixing involves multiple rights at the same time.

At the same time, there are exceptions such as quotation, personal use, and educational use, so not all reuse is prohibited. The problem is that boundaries always require interpretation.

> Copyright is not a fixed prohibition rule, but a framework for adjustment.

## Remix and Fair Use under U.S. Law

A distinctive feature of US copyright law is the fair use provision. It has the flexibility to allow use without permission after comprehensively determining factors such as the purpose of use, nature of the work, amount of use, and impact on the market.

In music sampling lawsuits, there has been an increase in the number of cases in which even short fragments are judged to be infringing, but modified uses for parody and criticism have been protected to a certain extent. This concept of transformability has become an important criterion in video remix and meme culture.

> US law has a structure in which freedom of expression and protection of rights are adjusted after the fact.

---

## Harmonization and exceptions in EU law

In the EU, the focus is on directives aimed at harmonizing systems among member countries. While copyright protection is relatively strong, there are clear exceptions regarding parody and quotation.

The Digital Single Market Directive clarified platform responsibilities and had a major impact on how remixes and user-generated content are handled. It has also been pointed out that the automatic detection and deletion mechanism may lead to atrophy of expression.

> EU law systematically seeks a balance between market integration and cultural protection.

## Translation and citation under Japanese law

Japanese copyright law places a strong emphasis on the right to adapt, and use that involves modification generally requires permission. Quotations must meet strict requirements and do not necessarily go well with remixes.

On the other hand, in recent years, efforts have been made to respond to the digital age, such as by introducing flexible rights restriction regulations and making it a non-prosecution offense. Derivative creation culture has developed uniquely between systems and practices.

>Japanese law, while emphasizing clarity, has relied on complementation by custom.

## Video remix and mashup

In the video field, re-editing movies, reconstructing trailers, and fan-made videos have expanded remix culture. Because visual references are more obvious than music, rights issues are easier to visualize.

Still, critical reediting and pedagogical use have gained some legitimacy.

> Video remix emphasizes criticality through the power of visual quotation.

---

## Internet Memes and Instant Reuse

Memes are cultural forms that add short text or modifications to existing images or videos and spread instantly. The unknown author, rapid distribution speed, and chain of transformation do not presuppose conventional rights management.

In many cases, shared social context is central to value, and economic exploitation is secondary.

> Memes are repeatedly produced and consumed at a speed that exceeds the time sense of the copyright system.

---

## Derivative creations and fan culture

Derivative works such as doujinshi, fan art, and cover videos are practices that simultaneously respect and critique the original work. In Japan in particular, culture has been supported by the tacit approval and guidelines of rights holders.

This can be said to be a choice that prioritizes cultural sustainability over strict legal application.

> Derivative creations are a cultural ecosystem that has been established through agreements outside the system.

## Re-editing problem in the AI ​​era

Generation and conversion by AI further expands the concept of remixing. Data use, output similarity, and style imitation during the learning stage raise issues that cannot be resolved using traditional copyright concepts.

> AI will redefine who is responsible for remixing.

## Conclusion

The issue of remix culture and rights is a history of adjustment rather than mere conflict. Through music, images, memes, and derivative works, culture has always used the past as material to create the future. The legal system cannot completely control the flow, but it can direct it.

> How we treat remixes is a test of how society views creativity.
