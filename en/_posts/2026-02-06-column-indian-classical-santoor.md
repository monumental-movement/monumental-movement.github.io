## Prologue: The sense of time in Indian music told by countless strings

Text: mmr｜Theme: The history of the Indian classical musical instrument santoor and the overall picture of modern interpretations that continue to update the tradition

Although the santoor is a relatively new mainstream instrument in Indian classical music, it is associated with an extremely ancient musical perspective. The structure, in which countless metal strings strung over a wooden resonance box are struck with thin mallets, does not separate melody and rhythm, but treats the particles of sound themselves as a flow of time.

In Indian classical music, what is important is not ""where the melody goes" but ""how the notes rise and fall". The santour can be said to be the instrument that most directly visualizes this idea.

> Santour is not an instrument that arranges sounds, but rather presents time as vibration.

## Origin and geographical background of Santoor

The original form of the santur is thought to date back to percussion instruments distributed in ancient Persia and Central Asia. Similar instruments called santoor, santoor, and santoor have existed widely in Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Kashmir.

In the Indian subcontinent, Kashmir Santoor, which developed in the northern Kashmir region, is particularly important. In this region, the santur was used in secular music associated with Sufism and court culture, and functioned as an accompaniment instrument for singing.

> The santour was not an isolated instrument, but was formed through trade routes and cultural exchanges.

## A heretical presence in Indian classical music

The sitar, sarod, and bansuri, which are the main instruments of Hindustani music, all emphasize sustained and smooth sounds. On the other hand, since the santur is a percussion instrument, the duration of the sound is short, making it difficult to directly express meand (smooth sounds).

For this reason, the santour has long been considered ""incomplete as a classical instrument.'' However, this restriction became the basis for later unique interpretations.

> Restrictions were not a drawback, but a condition for creating new musical idioms.

## Innovation by Pandit Shivkumar Sharma

Pandit Shivkumar Sharma was the man who promoted the santoor as an official solo instrument in Indian classical music in the late 20th century. He improved the string structure of the santoor and realized the scale system necessary for raga performance.

In addition, by making use of the granularity of the sound produced by striking the strings and establishing a playing method that simulates gamaka and meando, the santur gained its status as a melodic instrument.

> Sharma's accomplishment was not in changing the instrument, but in changing the way the instrument was heard.

## Santoor in Raga and Tara

Even in the performance of the santoor, the time period, emotional character, and scale structure of the raga are strictly observed. The clear attack from the strings adds a new sense of tension to the static development of Aarap.

Once in the tala, the santoor begins to take on a percussive driving force, blurring the line between melody and rhythm. This duality creates a charm that is not found in other melodic instruments.

> The santour is an instrument that exists between melody and rhythm.

---

## Recording technology and Santour expansion

Since the late 20th century, advances in recording technology have had a significant impact on the reputation of santour. The details of the santour, which has a short decaying sound, were emphasized by the microphone, giving it a three-dimensional sound.

This has led to its application not only to solo performances but also to ensembles and film music.

> Technology has expanded Santour's presence, not volume.

---

## Connection to contemporary music/fusion

Since the 1970s, Santoor has been associated with jazz, ambient, and minimal music. The regular string striking pattern goes well with the repetitive structure, and it has also been integrated with drones and electronic sounds.

Even in performances outside of the Indian classical framework, raga thinking continues to influence the selection of sounds.

> Even in places far removed from tradition, Santoor's way of thinking has not been lost.

---

## Performance aesthetics in modern interpretation

Modern santour players go back and forth between pure classical performance and experimental expression. With an emphasis on complete improvisation, sonic texture, and the treatment of silence, the santour is being redefined as a musical object.

Performances often begin with a soft note. The moment the mallet touches the string, before there is a clear sound of impact, you can feel the metal string pushing through the air. The overtones that appear immediately after that vaguely dissolve the individual pitches, forming a cloud of sustained resonance.

> The santour is changing from an instrument to be played to one that shapes the listening space.

---

## Symbiotic relationship between Kashmiri folk songs and santoor

In Kashmir, santoor was deeply associated with folk culture even before classical music. It was often played to the tune of a song at wedding ceremonies, seasonal festivals, religious gatherings, and other occasions.

When playing the santour as an accompaniment to folk songs, the intonation of the melody and the speaking style are given priority over strict musical scales. The mallet is not swung down with a constant force, but rather changes its speed and angle subtly to match the singer's breathing.

> In Kashmiri folk songs, the santoor did not dominate the melody, but had the role of enveloping the narrative.

---

## Comparison with Santur in other regions: Focusing on Iran

Iranian santurs have fewer strings than Indian ones, and have a more organized range. The melodies are more clearly delineated, and improvisations are developed through changes in ornamentation.

While Indian santoor emphasizes the continuous flow of sound, Iranian santoor has a strong note-by-note structure. When playing, the mallet is struck at a nearly perpendicular angle to the strings, bringing the attack sound clearly into the foreground.

> Although they have the same name, their musical philosophy differs greatly depending on the region.

---

## Details of string structure and tuning philosophy

The Indian classical santoor has around 100 strings, which are divided into courses of multiple strings. Each course is tuned to the same pitch to ensure stability in volume and overtones.

The tuning changes for each raga, and the arrangement is such that the tonic and subordinate notes are particularly emphasized. This creates a natural resonance drone while avoiding unnecessary sounds during performance.

> Tuning is not a preparatory work, but an idea that functions as a part of the performance.

---

## Structural affinity with ambient/minimal music

In modern interpretation, santour shows a high affinity with ambient and minimal music. Repeated short phrases expand the sense of time and lead the listener into a non-linear state.

In performance, the same note pattern is repeated with slight changes in intensity. What initially sounds like a simple hitting sound gradually becomes perceived as a continuous wave, and the boundaries between sounds begin to dissolve.

> Santoor does not make us hear the structure, but rather shows us the process by which the structure is perceived.

> The history of the santour can be understood not as a change in musical style, but as a change in the way it is listened to.

## Final Chapter: Cultural Memory as Vibration

The santur is not just a folk instrument. This is one answer to the question of how sound remembers time. When countless strings strike at the same time, the individual notes disappear and only the overall resonance remains.

This characteristic is the reason why santour continues to be updated even in modern times.

> The santour is not an instrument that preserves the past, but a device that transforms the past into the present.
