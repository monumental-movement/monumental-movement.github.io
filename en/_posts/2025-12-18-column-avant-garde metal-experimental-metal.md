## Prologue

Text: mmr | Theme: Redesigning the structure, time, and gravity of avant-garde metal/experimental metal


Avant-Garde Metal is not a genre, but rather a structural reexamination of the metal musical system.

The trend known as Avant-Garde Metal or Experimental Metal is not defined by the extremeness of the sound or the sophistication of technique. Its essence lies in an attitude of questioning the structure, time, repetition, and center of gravity that metal has always assumed, and redesigning them.

In this article, I will reconsider avant-garde metal not as a deviant expression, but as a structural ideology. At its center are Gorguts and Maudlin of the Well. Both artists dismantled and rebuilt the internal structure of metal music from different directions.

## Structural assumptions in metal

To understand avant-garde metal, it is first necessary to clarify what is the premise behind regular metal.

Traditional metal has been formed as a collection of structural assumptions such as the following.

* Beat is stable and perceptible
* Riffs are repeated and create gravity
* Double beats serve as time reference points
* Songs have a circular structure
* The climax is designed as a reaching point.

Avant-Garde Metal does not deny these assumptions in part, but invalidates them as a system.

---

## Redefining avant-garde

Avant-garde is not about eccentricity or radicalness, but rather the ability to dismantle existing grammar from within.

The reason Avant-Garde Metal is perceived as difficult is not because of its excessive emotional expression, but because the structures that listeners have unconsciously relied on no longer function. The beat is present but unreliable, the riff is presented but doesn"t stick, and even though it develops, predictions don"t come true.

---

## Evolution and divergence of extreme music

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal rapidly became more extreme in terms of speed, sonic pressure, and density. However, quantitative expansion eventually reached a saturation point, and some artists began to question the structure itself.

At this turning point, avant-garde metal was born. Rather than further increasing speed and weight, the choice was to dismantle the structural conditions under which they were established.

---

## Establishment of structural avant-garde metal

When structure becomes problematic, metal moves to a new stage. Riffs become fragments rather than repeating units, time signatures become disturbances rather than standards, and songs progress as irreversible changes rather than cycles.

---

## Gorguts: Structural design as destruction

Gorguts dismantled death metal itself from the inside out, using its vocabulary to its fullest.

In their music, riffs are present but without driving force, time signatures are notated but unstable, and development is perceived as ruptures rather than continuity. This is not an introduction of elements outside the genre, but an avant-garde effect created by distorting the internal grammar.

---

## Gorguts riff design principle

Gorguts' riffs deliberately reject the gravity of repetition. Phrase lengths are unequal, pitch relationships have no resolution, and start and end points are treated equally.

The riff is not a device that propels the song forward, but rather serves as a momentary cross-section to present a structural state.

## Rhythm structure of Gorguts

Gorguts does not erase the meter, but it creates a state in which the meter cannot be trusted. The phrases do not converge to the beat, and instead of emphasizing the double beats, the drums play the role of cutting off the sense of beat.

This rhythm is not a polyrhythm, but should be called a beat-deconstructed rhythm.

---

## Album analysis: Gorguts "Obscura"

In Obscura, Gorguts' structural ideas are realized in an extreme form. The songs are not a collection of riffs, but rather a chain of fragmented pitch arrangements and unstable rhythms.

* There is no hierarchical relationship between riffs
* Time signature change does not indicate a structural change
* Dissonance becomes the norm and the concepts of tension and release disappear.

As a result, the entire album comes across as one giant structural experiment.

---

## Album analysis: Gorguts "From Wisdom to Hate"

In this work, the structural deconstruction established in Obscura is partially controlled. The riffs are still non-functional, but they give some order to their placement and slightly restore the readability of the structure.

This balance is an important transition point between complete dissolution and complete regression.

---

## Maudlin of the Well: Internalized avant-garde

Maudlin of the Well's avant-garde is based not on destruction but on internalization. They destabilize the structure by running multiple musical periods simultaneously.

---

## Multilayer time structure

Maudlin of the Well's songs have multiple layers of metal time, chamber music time, and ambient time.

These time layers are not integrated, but always coexist with a gap between them.

## Breathing rhythm

Their rhythm is not a beat, but more similar to breathing or the length of a story. The tempo is not fixed, and the drums play a role in regulating spatial density rather than being a time keeper.

---

## Album Analysis: Maudlin of the Well "Bath"

In "Bath," the intense metal section and the quiet chamber music part are clearly separated, yet coexist within the same song. The structure is not linear, but progresses as a movement in psychological space.

---

## Album Analysis: Maudlin of the Well "Leaving Your Body Map"

In this work, the separation of structures goes even further. The songs are structured as transitions of states rather than developments, and the concept of climax virtually disappears.

---

## Comparison of both structural ideas

| Perspective | Gorguts | Maudlin of the Well |
| --- | ------- | ------------------- |
| Method | Demolition | Layering |
| Time | Rupture | Parallel |
| Rhythm | Destruction of pulse sensation | Breathing control |
| Dissonance | Structural armament | Spatial production |

---

## Influence and inheritance of avant-garde metal

Avant-garde metal didn't create a genre, it left behind a way of thinking. In subsequent extreme music, structure became an element as important as, or even more than, expression.

---

## Chronology: Transition of structure-oriented metal

| Age | Structural trends |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Late 1980s | Expansion of extreme music |
| Early 1990s | Dissonance/odd time signature |
| Late 1990s | Structural demolition type avant-garde metal |
| 2000s | Introspective/spatial structure |
| Since the 2010s | Structural thinking has become the norm |

---

## Conclusion

Gorguts and Maudlin of the Well are not polar opposites of avant-garde metal. They are different coordinates that exist on the same structural axis.

Avant-garde metal is not a movement that radicalizes music, but an act that continues to question the very conditions under which music exists. The question remains unfinished and is being updated.
