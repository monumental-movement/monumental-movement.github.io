The Rapture is a US dance punk rock band from New York formed in 1998. They disbanded in 2014, but resumed their activities in 2019.

They mix various genres of music such as dance punk, post-punk, acid house, disco, and electronica, and are known as the pioneers of the post-punk revival in the early 2000s, especially for their unique style that mixes early post-punk sounds with electronic and dance.

Released in 2011 by DFA Records, "In The Grace Of Your Love" is The Rapture's third and final studio album.
