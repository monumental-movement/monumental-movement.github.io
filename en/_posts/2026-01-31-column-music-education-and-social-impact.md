## Music education as a social device

Text: mmr｜Theme: How has music education changed society? -Cultural impact interpreted from the system, field, and history


Music education is not just technical training. Like reading, writing, and arithmetic, it has been designed as a system for specifying what nations, religions, and communities should share.
In schools, churches, the military, and local communities, music has always been linked to group formation, discipline, and the transmission of values.

In the West, systematic music education was established in medieval monasteries. The unified transmission of Gregorian chant was the earliest example of the inseparability of musical notation and the educational system.
Here, music was both a religious practice and an educational content that cultivated a class of knowledge.

With the establishment of the modern nation, music education was incorporated into the public education system. Singing of the national anthem, singing education, and training of military bands were introduced as part of national unification through music.
Before music education was ""sensitivity education,'' it functioned as a device to stabilize the social structure.

> Music education has always been designed within social institutions, supporting both culture and governance.

## Formation of the public education system and music curriculum


After the 19th century, when compulsory education systems were established in each country, music became an official subject.
In Prussia and France, music education was combined with moral education and played a role in instilling collective behavior and discipline.

In the United States, the concept of ""music appreciation'' was introduced in the late 19th century, and emphasis was placed on developing not only performance techniques but also appreciation skills.
This was also a means of forming a common culture in an immigrant society.

Singing education was introduced in Japan during the Meiji period, and a unique educational system was built that was based on Western music theory but combined Japanese lyrics and national ideals.
Music was a symbol of modernization and at the same time functioned as part of national education.

In the latter half of the 20th century, music education shifted its focus from skill training to expressive activities.
Educational methods that emphasize children's independence, such as the Orff, Kodály, and Suzuki methods, have become popular internationally.

> Changes in music curriculum reflect changes in the roles that society expects from children.

## Relationship between local community and music education


Apart from school education, music education rooted in local communities has long existed.
Folk songs, festival music, and religious music have been preserved through intergenerational transmission and supported community memory.

European brass band culture is a typical example of musical education in the working class during the Industrial Revolution.
Factories and local organizations provided instruments, and through ensemble performances, discipline and solidarity were fostered.

In Latin America and Africa, music education is often conducted outside of school, and a culture that emphasizes physical expression and improvisation has been maintained.
This shows the existence of a knowledge system different from Western musical score education.

Community music education has played a role in preserving cultural diversity as well as social inclusion.
Music has become central to identity education, especially in immigrant and minority communities.

> Community-based music education has supported social diversity from outside the system.

## Music education and social class


Access to music education has long been strongly tied to social class.
The cost of purchasing musical instruments, the cost of lessons, and the availability of time were more advantageous than those of the middle class.

Classical music education has been particularly associated with elite education and has functioned as a symbol of cultural capital.
On the other hand, music education for the working class centered on group forms such as chorus and wind bands.

From the latter half of the 20th century onwards, the disparity in opportunities for music education was corrected to a certain extent through public subsidies and the expansion of school education.
However, economic factors continue to influence musical instrument education and professional education.

The rise of hip-hop and electronic music has relativized traditional music education models.
A production environment that does not require expensive instruments or long-term training has created new learning paths.

> The form of music education is also a mirror of social class structure.

## Social Change and Music Education Program


After the end of the 20th century, music education began to be reevaluated as part of social policy.
Music programs were introduced in the context of improving public safety, correcting educational disparities, and supporting youth.

A typical example is the large-scale youth orchestra education in South America.
This is a social education model that emphasizes group participation and continuity more than the acquisition of musical techniques.

In Western countries, music education has also been incorporated into special needs education and rehabilitation programs.
Rhythm training and ensemble activities are associated with improved communication skills.

These efforts demonstrate that music education is an area that intersects not only with cultural policy but also with social welfare and educational policy.

> Music education has gone beyond arts policy and is beginning to function as a part of social policy.

## Music education in the digital age


In the 21st century, music education has rapidly become digital.
DAWs, online teaching materials, and video sharing platforms have revolutionized the learning environment.

Knowledge that was previously limited to specialized institutions can now be shared widely through the Internet.
This has brought about the democratization of music education and the diversification of evaluation standards.

On the other hand, the division between systematic education and self-study has also been pointed out.
While there are concerns about a decline in basic theory and music reading ability, learning outcomes that emphasize creativity have also been confirmed.

The digital environment has moved music education from a single-track career to a multi-track learning model.

> Digitalization is expanding the scope of music education, and at the same time changing the way we view education itself.

## What music education has left behind


Although music education is a field whose results are difficult to quantify, it has had a long-term impact on society.
Aspects such as cultural inheritance, social participation, and the formation of a sense of community are difficult to replace in other educational fields.

Although music education as a system has always changed, the experience of interacting with others through sound itself is universal.
It is one of the areas of education that most clearly shows what kind of human being society is looking for.

> Music education has quietly but surely shaped society's values.
