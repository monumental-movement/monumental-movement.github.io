## Prologue: What the name S.O.A meant

Text: mmr｜Theme: About music presented as the structure of time itself

S.O.A is a hardcore punk band formed in New York in 1980. Their active period is extremely short, and their official discography is limited. However, its existence cannot be dismissed as mere prehistory or a preparatory stage. S.O.A appeared on the border between 70"s punk and 80"s hardcore, capturing the tension, violence, and suffocation of young people in the city of New York in a way that couldn't be erased any further.

The band's name, ""State of Alert,'' is a word that means constant vigilance. Rather than being a political slogan, this was a literal expression of the state of mind of young people living in New York at the time. Economic instability, deteriorating public order, urban ruin, and a rift within the punk scene. S.O.A presented them with sonic speed and shortness without explaining them.

> S.O.A (State Of Alert) was a short-lived but definitive band that existed just before New York hardcore took on its own definition.

## Turning point from New York punk to hardcore

New York punk in the late 1970s had formed its own cultural sphere around CBGB. The style presented by bands like the Ramones, Television, and Patti Smith already had international influence. On the other hand, musical vocabulary and expressions were rapidly becoming standardized, and were already becoming ""done'' for the younger generation.

Around the same time, a new expression of punk was emerging in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.: faster, shorter, and more aggressive. This movement, which was later called hardcore, steadily spread to New York. The entity that most clearly embodied that initial impulse was S.O.A.


> Around 1980, when S.O.A appeared in New York, punk was established as a style, and at the same time, its limits were beginning to be exposed.

## Member composition and history of formation

The central figure of S.O.A is Henry Rollins. Rollins, later known as the frontman of Black Flag, was at this point a young man from Washington, D.C., and joined S.O.A while in New York. Although his style as a vocalist was immature compared to his later expressions, it already possessed an extreme sense of urgency and directness.

The guitar, bass, and drum members were also closely connected to the New York underground punk scene, and later moved on to other important bands. This structure of being ""dismantled in a short period of time and rebuilt in a different form'' was itself a characteristic of the hardcore scene of the early 1980s.

> S.O.A functions as a mother body that gives birth to multiple subsequent bands, and its network influence is out of proportion to its short period of activity.

## Sound features: speed and reduction

S.O.A's music is not oriented toward performance technique or complexity. Most of the songs last around one minute, and there are almost no introductions or development elements. The drums serve to push the beat forward rather than drive it, and the guitar is more on the border between noise and rhythm than a riff.

This musicality is different from the "heaviness" and "groove" of later New York hardcore, and is rather closer to the early impulses of D.C. hardcore. However, S.O.A's sound has a dry tension typical of urban New York, and the immediate outpouring of emotion is more at the forefront than politics.

> S.O.A's songs exist as a result of excision rather than construction.

---

## Lyrics and expression stance

S.O.A's lyrics are short and direct, with little use of metaphor or narrative. What is depicted here is a fragmented sense of oppression, anger, and self-defense. It does not explicitly prescribe any particular political ideology or social movement, but rather focuses on reflexive reactions to the circumstances in which individuals find themselves.

This attitude differs from later straight edge and political hardcore. S.O.A existed at a stage before it had developed its ideology, and was emitting unexpressed anxiety and violence as sound.

> S.O.A's lyrics do not explain the message, leaving only the emotional pressure.

## No Policy E.P.: The only official sound source

The only official sound source left by S.O.A is **No Policy E.P.**, which was released as a 7-inch disc. This work condenses S.O.A's musical characteristics. All the songs are extremely short, the recordings are rough, and there are no decorations.

No Policy E.P. is not a work that is evaluated for its completeness or sound quality. Its value lies in the fact that it preserves the early state of hardcore in New York at the time in an unprocessed form. 7inch has become an important reference point when considering how structured and institutionalized hardcore became in later years.

> No Policy E.P. is the only definitive record of the existence of S.O.A.

## Live activities and dissolution

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-13jO7QKlU?si=R9wljIejBr65O4Lt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

S.O.A's live activities were short-lived and the venues were limited. They primarily performed in small clubs and DIY spaces, and were only known within the New York punk scene at the time. At live performances, the emphasis was on the energy of collision rather than musical perfection, and the distance from the audience was extremely close.

The band disbanded around 1981. The reason for the group's disbandment is more like a natural disappearance due to the movement of members and changes in their interests, rather than a specific incident. However, this dissolution does not end S.O.A. Instead, it spreads in a different way.

> S.O.A was a live band and was more present in the field than on record.

## Flow derived from S.O.A


Henry Rollins joins Black Flag after S.O.A disbands. There, he acquired a more sustained and structured expression. On the other hand, members of the New York side and surrounding figures became involved in the formation of the scene that led to Agostic Front and Cro-Mags.

S.O.A itself is rarely talked about as a representative of New York hardcore. However, as a record of that ""nobody phase,'' it provides important clues for understanding what subsequent bands inherited and what they discarded.

> S.O.A functioned as a turning point rather than an end point.

## Position in New York Hardcore History


New York hardcore has had a distinct style and aesthetic since the mid-1980s. However, S.O.A existed at a previous stage, embodying music that had not even been given a name yet.

Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate S.O.A independently. However, S.O.A is indispensable for understanding what was going on before hardcore had a norm of ""this is how things should be''.

> S.O.A captures the genre at its most volatile moment, before it was defined.

> Although S.O.A's activities are short, they closely overlap with the changes of the times.

## Conclusion: Sounds left on alert

> S.O.A was not a completed work, but an alarm sound itself.

S.O.A does not aim for success or sustainability. However, its fleeting existence most directly shows the sense of urgency from which hardcore music was born. The few minutes of sound that make up No Policy E.P. retain the raw, raw impulse that predated the genre's institutionalization.
