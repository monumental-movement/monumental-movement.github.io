## Prologue: What is <Cloud Rap>?

Text: mmr｜Theme: About the genealogy of cloud rap that intersects with Lo-Fi Hip Hop

Cloud Rap arose around 2010, centered around the Bay Area and U.S. Internet Underground, and developed while connecting with post-vaporwave subculture aesthetics, Chopped & Screwed, Lo-Fi Hip-Hop, and modern emo rap. In particular, the activities of **Lil B**, **Clams Casino**, and **Main Attrakionz** symbolized the early days, forming the basis of a lineage that would later lead to **Lil Peep**, **XXXTENTACION**, **Bones**, and **Yung Lean**.

Cloud Rap was far more ambient-oriented than traditional Hip Hop, featuring a more ambient-oriented sound, vocal processing with strong reverb, and dreamy textures with spatial FX, and later evolved into Vaportrap, absorbing electronic music and Vaporwave-like meme culture.

## I. Preparatory steps before Cloud Rap (2000–2008)

### ● Hip-hop and mixtape culture from the internet

In the late 2000s, MySpace and DatPiff expanded the mixtape culture of Internet distribution, allowing collaboration without geographical constraints. This became the soil that gave rise to Cloud Rap's ""liberation from geography.''

### ● Influence of Chopped & Screwed

**Screw processing (slowing speed, changing pitch, emphasizing reverberation)**, derived from DJ Screw's method, greatly contributed to the ""ethereal tempo'' of later Cloud Rap.

---

## II. Formation of Cloud Rap (2009–2012)

### ● Cultural area of ​​Lil B and Based World

---

Around 2009, Lil B developed a rap style that was highly compatible with Internet culture, and the producers who supported his music formed the prototype of Cloud Rap.

---

### ● Introducing Clams Casino

---

Clams Casino"s instrumental collection released around 2011 and the music they provided to A$AP Rocky determined Cloud Rap"s sonic image, with its ""misty pads," ""ambient melodies," and ""deep spatial processing.''

---

### ● Main Attrakionz and Scene Expansion

---

Main Attrakionz established the word "cloud" as their own style, expanding the non-commercial, DIY cultural sphere of artists of the Bandcamp generation.

---

## III. Emergence of Vaportrap (2013–2016)

Vaportrap is a style that combines the methodology of vaporwave (sampling, reconstruction of 80s-90s consumer culture, ambient textures) with the beat structure of trap.

### ● Aesthetic features

* Textures of 90s consumer culture (CMs, late-night shows, virtual spaces, etc.)
* Spatial processing using extreme reverb and delay
* BPM is almost the same as Trap (120–150), but the texture is similar to Vaporwave

### ● Deepening producer culture

Centered on SoundCloud, high-speed production and high-speed consumption occurred at the level of personal home recording, and the flow from Cloud Rap to Vaportrap was formed.

---

## IV. Connection between Lo-Fi HipHop and "Cloud Rap"

### ● Lo-Fi HipHop methodology

* Sampler culture such as MPC
* Noise, analog texture, cassette tape distortion
* Expansion of streaming culture as Chillhop / Study Beats

Cloud Rap's vocal processing easily mixes with Lo-Fi Hip Hop, and the works of Lil Peep and XXXTENTACION combine **guitar sound x Lo-Fi processing x Cloud Rap-like floating feeling**.

---

## V. The Rise of Emo Rap/Sad Rap (2016–2018)

### ● Lil Peep influence

---

Lil Peep developed a style that mixed elements of emo, punk, and cloud rap, forming the core of the post-SoundCloud Rap aesthetic. In particular, the combination of **guitar sample x reverb x sad melody** had a strong influence on subsequent songs.

---

### ● Diversity of XXXTENTACION

---

XXXTENTACION has practiced a wide range of styles, from cloud rap to hardcore, R&B, and alternative. The minimal sound structure, emphasis on low frequencies, and ambient elements were all in line with Vaportrap's direction.

---

## VI. Modern Vaportrap / Cloud Rap (2019–2025)

### ● Internationalization and eliminating regional differences

With the rise of YouTube, SoundCloud, and TikTok, Cloud Rap techniques are spreading to all parts of the world. Similar production methods have become common in Asia and Europe.

### ● Changes in beat culture due to generative AI (fact-based)

In the late 2020s, cloud-like pads and ambient texture generation using diffusion and generative models have become commonplace, making production faster in the home environment.

---

## Sound structure analysis

### ● Typical beat elements of Vaportrap / Cloud Rap

## Conclusion: Where is "cloud rap" headed?

Cloud Rap is not just a genre, it has become a symbol of post-internet hip-hop production methods, aesthetics, and distribution culture. The fusion with Vaportrap continues to indicate a direction in which music revolves around the online aesthetic sphere rather than the physical context.

In the future, by linking with generation AI, it is expected that the Cloud Rap-like texture will become even more abstract, expanding into a more ambient and "inhuman" sound image.
