Dewdrops in the Garden is the third and final studio album by American dance music band Deee-Lite, released in August 1994 by Elektra Records.

The album moved away from the political lyrical content of its predecessor, moving towards themes of dance and intimacy, with an emphasis on leaning towards psychedelic music.
