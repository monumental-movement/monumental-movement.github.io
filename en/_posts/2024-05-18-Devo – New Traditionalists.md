---


"New Traditionalists" is the fourth album by US new wave band Devo, released in 1981, and the band's first completely self-produced album.

Following the success of their previous album Freedom Of Choice (Desire Psychology), which included "Whip It," this album has a minimalist atmosphere with an emphasis on synthesizer riffs, rhythm, and electronic percussion, with the concept of "deevolution."
