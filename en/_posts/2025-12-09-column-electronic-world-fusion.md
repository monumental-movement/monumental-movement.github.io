## Introduction: How electronic music opened to the world

Text: mmr｜Theme: From the origins of Electronic World Fusion to its technical aspects, representative works, regional characteristics, and contemporary significance

In the second half of the 20th century, electronic music developed around synthesizers and samplers, but at the same time traditional music from around the world began to enter Western pop culture. Electronic World Fusion is an area where the two are fully connected, and is a rare genre where the history, culture, and ideology of technology and folk music intersect.

Representative artists include **Nitin Sawhney**, who incorporates Indian classical music and social themes, and **Thievery Corporation**, which fuses downtempo with diverse musical elements from Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia.

## 1. Origin: The encounter between electronic music and folk music

### 1-1 Progress of electronic music and import of world music

Since the 1970s, as electronic musical instruments have become widespread, music from around the world has been introduced across national borders through recording technology and the record industry. The environment was created for electronic sounds and folk music to meet, and experimental fusion works began to emerge.

### 1-2 Ethnic music sampling and criticism

In the 1980s and 1990s, with the spread of samplers, folk music sources were incorporated and reconstructed in new contexts. However, issues of ethics and rights when using sound sources from different cultural backgrounds were also discussed.

## 3. World music by region × Characteristics of electronic acoustics

### 3-1 South Asian

* Raga system, tala (metered structure)
* Complex divided rhythms of tabla
* Highly compatible with electronic acoustics, developed in both ambient and danceable genres

### 3-2 Middle East/North Africa

* The spatial processing of reggae/dub goes well with electronica.

### 3-4 Africa

* Polyrhythm and call and response
* Often fused with minimal techno, emphasizing repetitive structures

---

## 4. Technical elements: sampler synth field recording

### 4-1 Reconstruction of ethnic sound sources using a sampler

* Pitch and tempo synchronization
* Loop structuring
* It is important to maintain the texture of existing instruments while integrating them into electronic rhythms.

### 4-2 Role of synthesizer

* Amplify the modality of folk music with drones (sustained sounds)
* Create a sense of space with pad sounds and embrace traditional sounds

### 4-3 Utilization of field recording (environmental sounds)

* Live recordings of religious ceremonies, street sounds, and folk instruments
* Functions as an ethnographic extension

Folk instrument drones, multi-layered sustained sounds, and recordings of natural environments are widely incorporated into ambient works.

### 7-3 Handling regional music in the AI ​​era

In modern times, sound source analysis and generation using AI technology is progressing, but issues of cultural background and rights are constantly debated.

---

## 8. Production theory of Electronic World Fusion

### 8-1 Handling rhythm

* Should we use ethnic rhythms as they are?
* Should it be synchronized to electronic 4/4 beats?
* The impression changes greatly depending on how much processing is done.

### 8-2 Treatment of scales and modes

* The scale system of ragas and makams is different from Western scales.
* Requires pitch bend and micro-tuning to reproduce on a synth

### 8-3 Importance of collaboration

* Live recording with traditional instrument players
*Must be produced with an understanding of the cultural background of local music.

## 9. The core of Electronic World Fusion: **"Translation of cross-cultural sounds"**

Electronic World Fusion doesn't just replace folk music with electronic sounds;
**"The process by which sound translates culture and connects different values"**
can be understood as

The genre embodies sonic dialogue, as Nitin Sawhney depicts multicultural societies through his work, and Thievery Corporation connects music from around the world to urban electronic music contexts.

---

## 10. Conclusion: Electronic World Fusion as a global musical dialogue

Electronic music and world music have evolved as media that connect technology and culture, and people and society. Electronic World Fusion will continue to develop as a place where diverse values ​​intersect through sound, while connecting with new technology, music, and local culture.
