## What is Electronic Body Music?

Text: mmr｜Theme: What is electronic body music?

<hr>

### Origin: Industrial reverberations and mechanical rhythms
EBM is a genre of electronic music that originated in Europe (mainly Belgium and Germany) in the early 1980s. The name comes from the fact that the music is composed of a physical dance groove and electronics. This can be described as a fusion of industrial music and electronic dance music.

In particular, the following two groups are known as pioneers:

- [**Front 242**](https://amzn.to/4oiO6zQ) (Belgium)

- [**DAF**](https://amzn.to/4ogYOH1) (Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, Germany)

By making full use of cold, sharp electronics, violent minimal beats, and militaristic vocals, they created a new kind of "physical electronic music" that differs from conventional pop and rock.

<hr>

### Sound characteristics
To put it simply, EBM's sound is "inorganic and physical." It features the following elements:

#### Hard and minimal beat

- Mainly 4/4 time signature, BPM around 120-140

- Mechanical rhythm like industrial machinery

- Heavy use of drum machines (Roland TR-808, TR-909, etc.)

<hr>

#### Synthesizers and Sequencers

- Monochrome, dark, heavy synth sound

- Loop configuration driven by analog/digital sequencer

- Balancing the trance state and physicality created by repetition

<hr>

#### Vocal

- Low, inorganic voices, mostly male voices

- Speaks in a commanding tone, slogan-like rather than singing.

- Often mixed with German, English, and French

- Many voices are distorted

<hr>

#### Theme and aesthetics

- War, surveillance, mechanization, human alienation, political irony

- European anxiety and social structure criticism during the Cold War

- Factories, cities, military uniforms, fetishism, leather culture

### Scene spread and influence
EBM rapidly spread in the club scene and underground from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. It had a strong influence on the electronic music scene in various parts of Europe, especially in Germany, Sweden, Austria, and France.

EBM has also had a huge influence on the following genres:

- Industrial rock/metal (e.g. [Ministry](https://amzn.to/47pfJBC), [Nine Inch Nails](https://amzn.to/4nPTgDL), [Rammstein](https://amzn.to/46ReLxY))

- Techno, acid techno

- Electrocrush, Dark Electro, Aggrotech

- Goth/Industrial Club Culture (Cybergoth)

<hr>

### Connection with club culture: EBM as body music
EBM is not just music to be listened to at home, but has a very strong aspect as ""music for dancing.'' Since the late 1980s, EBM has become an established culture, centered around specific nightclubs and festivals (e.g. Wave-Gotik-Treffen, Amphi Festival), accompanied by dark clothing, leather, and cyber costumes.

In the 1990s, while being looked back on as **"Old School EBM"**, the scene branched out into the following:

- Futurepop ([VNV Nation](https://amzn.to/4942pDT), [Covenant](https://amzn.to/4n5mRYq), etc.)

- Dark Electro / Harsh EBM ([Suicide Commando](https://amzn.to/3W1sPPd), [Hocico](https://amzn.to/4oiOwWW), etc.)

- Techno Body Music (TBM): EBM revival by techno DJs ([Helena Hauff](https://amzn.to/46RgP9c), [Ancient Methods](https://amzn.to/47ucub9))

<hr>

### Recent revival and current EBM
Since the 2010s, along with the techno-industrial revival, EBM has been reevaluated.

<hr>

#### Contemporary Artist

- [Phase Fatale](https://amzn.to/4qaNDkT)

- [Kris Baha](https://amzn.to/474K3Qx)

- [Boy Harsher](https://amzn.to/4n9b5MT)

- [Linea Aspera](https://amzn.to/4nMw7lj)

- [Years of Denial](https://amzn.to/46OccN4)

These artists are influenced by EBM, but combine it with elements such as coldwave, synthwave, and post-punk to create new forms of EBM.

<hr>

#### Distinctive trends

- Refocusing on analog equipment and hardware live performances

- Independent cassette/vinyl releases

- Cyberpunk/DIY revival in terms of fashion

- Return to "physical" DJ sets at clubs/raves

<hr>

### Aesthetics that fuses physical body and electronics
As the name suggests, EBM is "electronic body music." It was more than just dance music, it was a total form of expression: political, mechanical, physical, and rebellious.

Currently, the influence of EBM is spreading across many fields, from club culture and festivals to the DIY scene, art, and fashion.

And above all——
The "heat" that resides in that inorganic rhythm moves the body.
That is the essential appeal of EBM.
