Text: mmr｜Theme: Changes in the Eurorack modular synthesizer and its influence on the music scene

The Eurorack modular synthesizer was invented by German engineer Dieter Doepfer in the early 1990s. Starting from his A-100 system, by standardizing module sizes and power supply standards, a system was born that allowed modules from different manufacturers to be freely combined.

Smaller and more affordable than the traditional Moog and Bucla, Eurorack has gained the support of many musicians and enthusiasts, and has now developed into a large ecosystem with over 300 manufacturers participating around the world.

### Features of Surgeon's Live Setup

Surgeon's live setup is characterized by the pursuit of maximum expression with minimal equipment. He performs improvisationally using a limited number of modules rather than a complex combination of equipment. This creates a sense of unity with the audience and unpredictability, bringing a new dimension to live techno performances.
