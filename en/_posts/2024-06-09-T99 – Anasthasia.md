---


T99 was a Belgian duo active in the late 80"s and early 90"s.
T99 was originally Patrick De Meyer's solo project, but T99 became a Patrick De Meyer and Olivier Abbeloos recording after Patrick heard Olivier Abbeloos' song ""Anasthasia'' and suggested that Abbeloos release it as T99.

"Anasthasia" is a techno breakbeat hardcore track released in 1991 by XL Recordings, a UK independent label that releases rave and dance music.

Side AA is a remix by Nick Halkes and Richard Russell.
