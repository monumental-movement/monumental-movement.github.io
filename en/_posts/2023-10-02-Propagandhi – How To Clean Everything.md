"How to Clean Everything" is the debut album by punk rock band Propagandhi, released in 1993 on Fat Wreck Chords.

Mike Daronco of Allmusic said the album was "a fun, lively yet mass-oriented take on 'Anarchy 101,'" and Ron Knox of Vice Media said in 2016 that the album was designed to pose a challenge to listeners.
