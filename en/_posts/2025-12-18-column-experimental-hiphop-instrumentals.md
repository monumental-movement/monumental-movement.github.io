## Introduction: Structural changes caused by the absence of rap

Text: mmr｜Theme: The history of the establishment of experimental hip-hop instrumental music, the production process, sampling techniques, sonic structure, and the production practices of Knxwledge and Madlib.

Hip-hop is essentially a culture in which the MC's verbal expression and the repetitive structure of the beat complement each other. However, since the 1990s, as instrumental works without rap began to circulate independently, beats came to the foreground as a theme rather than an accompaniment. Especially in experimental instruments, there is no need for a homogeneous beat structure or development design for rapping, and time, texture, and fragmentation become the main design targets.

> "The absence of wrap is not an omission, but an expansion of design freedom."

## Terminology: Experimental Hip Hop Instrumentals

In this article, Experimental Hip Hop Instrumentals refers to a group of instrumentals that share the following production characteristics.

* Although the beat structure is based on 4/4, the repetition period is undefined.
* Samples are not used for the purpose of identifying the original song, but are treated as materials.
* The production process is presented as the value of the work rather than the finished product.

> "Genre names are not styles, but sets of attitudes."

## Technological prehistory: samplers and limitations

Digital samplers, which have become popular since the late 1980s, were introduced as devices for recording and playing back short audio fragments. Early equipment had severe limitations on memory capacity, sampling rate, and polyphony. These limitations not only reduced efficiency, but also inevitably caused sound quality deterioration and distortion.

> "Restrictions become established as musical individuality"

---

## From loop culture to fragment culture

In traditional hip-hop production, loops of two to eight bars were the basic unit of a song. In experimental instruments, this unit is extremely shortened, repeating and interrupting fragments of less than a beat, sometimes tens of milliseconds. As a result, listeners are required to follow the density of changes in the acoustics rather than counting beats.

> "Repetition is not stable, but functions as a series of discomforts"

## Madlib production practices

Madlib's production is characterized by an improvisational method centered around hardware samplers. When producing using the SP series, physical manipulation takes precedence over visual editing, leaving sample shifts and fluctuations intact in the music.

* Samples are selected with the premise of preserving the original sound.
* No strict quantization
* Generate a large amount of beats without assuming the final form

> "The accumulation of daily production rather than project units"

## Knxwledge production practices

Knxwledge is based on a DAW and features extremely short loops and isolated editing. The placement operation on the visual timeline serves to separate the sense of beat from the numbers.

* Loop unit of several seconds or less
*Groove formation by manual placement
* Output without sound pressure optimization

> "A feeling of incompleteness is not a lack, but a completed form."

## Decomposition of sampling techniques

Sampling in experimental instruments is for the purpose of transformation rather than citation or reference. The following processes are commonly observed:

* Extraction of single sounds, environmental sounds, and noise
* Stripping of timbre information due to pitch change
* Reverse playback and instantaneous fade processing

> "Samples are acoustic substances, not symbols."

---

## Mix and sound design

In the mixing process, density and distance are more important than clarity. The low end is not too tidy and retains distortion and saturation. This allows the rhythm to be perceived as a mass rather than a dot.

---

## Album editing theory

The structure, in which many short pieces are arranged in succession, has the character of an archive rather than a collection of songs. Silence and noise between songs act as editorial glue.

> "An album is not a finished product, but a bundle of production traces."

## Chronology: Experimental Hip Hop Instrumentals

* 1990s: Independent distribution of instrumental works
* 2000s: Increased number of sampler-based beat collections
* 2010s: Shortening of digital distribution premise
* 2020s: Visualization of the production process

---

## Intersection with other genres

The experimental instrumental is identified as hip-hop by the presence of a beat, while connecting with ambient, noise, and jazz improvisation.

---

## Listening environment

A structure adapted to intermittent playback rather than concentrated listening is consistent with modern production environments. The large amount of production assumes coexistence rather than consumption.

---

## Conclusion: Unfinished as a form

Experimental Hip Hop Instrumentals is a musical form that values ​​the act of production rather than perfection. Knxwledge and Madlib's production practices continue to present beats as units of thought rather than songs.
