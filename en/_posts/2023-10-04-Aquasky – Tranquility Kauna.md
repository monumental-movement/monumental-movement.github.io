title: Aquasky – Tranquility Kauna
---


This is an EP by Aquasky released in 1996 on the UK label "Moving Shadow".

Aquasky have worked with 4/4 aliases Black Noise, such as Southern Fried and Wearhouse Music, but this time they return to their roots with a track that takes them back to their Acid House days.

A must-hear EP from this era, from this trio whose career spanned acid, jungle, drum and bass, breakbeat, and now encompasses all forms of bass music.
