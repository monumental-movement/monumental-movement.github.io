# What is Modular Techno?

Text: mmr｜Theme: About the Modular Techno scene

**Modular Techno** is an electronic music genre that combines sound design centered on modular synthesizers with the rhythm structure of techno. Particularly in live performances, it is characterized by the artist's ability to improvise sounds and rhythms by patching synth modules and operating CV/Gate in real time.

Although its origins as a genre date back to the early 2000s, its foundational elements are deeply rooted in the emergence of analog modular synths in the 1970s and the formation of Detroit techno in the 1980s. Due to the high degree of freedom of modular synths, it is often possible to develop unique sounds that emphasize the texture and spatial expanse of the sound, rather than simply playing techno tracks.

In his live set, he manipulates rhythm, bass line, percussion, and noise effects in each module to create an improvised musical space that changes. As a result, listeners can experience an experience that is more like ""experiencing a performance" than ""listening to a track."

# Historical background and origin

## Early techno and analog synth

In the 1970s, modular synthesizers developed by Robert Moog, ARP, and others offered new possibilities for music production. These synths were groundbreaking in that they allowed individual connection of sound source modules, filters, LFOs, envelope generators, etc., and the ability to freely construct sonic structures.

In the early 1980s, Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson and others established the electronic music called "techno" in Detroit. Early Detroit Techno was mainly based on sequencers and rhythm machines, but the warm tones and complex sequencing techniques unique to analog synths became a bridge to later Modular Techno.

## Evolution of modular synths

In the 1990s, analog/digital hybrid modules from Roland, Korg, Doepfer, and others appeared, lowering the barrier to using modular synths and allowing many artists to create experimental sounds in their home studios or small clubs.

Especially since 1995, the Eurorack standard proposed by Doepfer has made modules compatible and compact, making it easier for individuals to build modular sets. This directly leads to the expansion of the Modular Techno scene from the 2000s onwards.

## Connection point to scene

In the early 2000s, artists who made full use of modular synths began to attract attention in the club scene mainly in Berlin. Surgeon, Ø [Phase], SNTS, and others created unique textures with their live sets that combined analog modules, providing an experience different from traditional techno clubs. Performances at Berlin clubs such as Berghain and Sisyphos are recognized as emblematic events for Modular Techno.

In addition, the publication of performance videos on online communities, forums, and YouTube greatly contributed to the worldwide spread. This led to an active exchange of information on modular synth technology and setups, accelerating the maturation of the scene as a whole.

# Representative artists and works

When talking about the Modular Techno genre, what is especially important is who uses modular synths, how they are used, and what kind of works and performances they have used to shape the scene. Here, we will focus on representative artists who are internationally recognized, and organize their styles and live approaches based on facts.

## Surgeon (Anthony Child)

British-born Surgeon is known as one of the first artists to introduce modular synths in the techno-industrial trend. Since the 2010s, his live sets have been built around Eurorack modules, establishing a style characterized by "completely improvised sound generation" rather than track playback. His live compositions progress through a combination of tonal changes through patching changes and rhythm generation using a sequencer, allowing the audience to experience physical changes in rhythm and noise in real time.

## Ø [Phase]

Ø [Phase], whose work focuses on a minimal and stoic sonic aesthetic within techno, actively utilizes modular synths in both studio and live production. It is particularly characterized by its complex phase modulation approach and the introduction of drone-like elements that utilize feedback loops, and has been praised for giving organic movement to minimal techno.

## Richie Hawtin

Richie Hawtin, who has been deeply involved in both Detroit techno and minimal techno, has also incorporated modular synths into his performances since the 2010s. His set is a composite of mixers, effects, computers, and Eurorack modules, and by finely manipulating the sonic dynamics, he creates a more fluid structure than traditional minimal techno.

## SNTS

SNTS, known as a highly anonymous artist, has a strong presence in the areas of dark techno and industrial techno. In his live set, he makes full use of analog saturation, distortion modules, noise sources, etc. to create a three-dimensional and violent acoustic space. That sound gained many followers and had a strong influence on the texture of bass lines and kicks.

# Technical aspects (junction between modular synth and techno)

The technical background of Modular Techno is a mechanism that controls each module using CV (Control Voltage), the flexibility of the patch structure, and an attitude that actively incorporates the "instability" unique to modular into sound. In this chapter, we will summarize how the unique elements of modular influence the production and performance of techno.

## Basic structure of modular synth

Modular synths generate sound by combining modules with functions such as sound sources, filters, envelopes, LFOs, VCFs, and VCAs, and connecting them with cables. The acoustic structure is completely up to the user's design and there are no fixed presets. This point goes well with the approach of techno, which emphasizes improvisation.

A major feature of the Eurorack standard is that modules from various manufacturers can be freely combined by standardizing the 3U size, module width HP, and power supply specifications. This has been a factor in the expansion of modular synth culture on a global scale since the 2000s.

## Role of sequencer and CV/Gate

Rhythm and groove play a central role in techno. A modular sequencer controls changes in pitch and filtering by changing the CV value for each step, and also plays the role of a rhythm machine. Furthermore, by synchronizing multiple modules using CV/Gate, it is possible to generate beats that include complex polyrhythms and randomness.

In particular, Modular Techno makes heavy use of the sequencer's randomization function and stochastic sequence generation. This creates an organic rhythm that is constantly undergoing subtle changes, rather than a fixed loop.

## Utilize filters, effects, and noise modules

Modular synths have a wide variety of filters and envelopes, which greatly contribute to the tonal design of techno. Effect modules such as a VCF with sour resonance, a wavefolder that creates a complex overtone structure, distortion and a bit crusher support the unique texture of Modular Techno.

Noise sources and random generators are also used in techno to strengthen the attack component and create ambient sound textures, creating accidental fluctuations in the rhythm.

## Construction and operation in a live set

Modular Techno's live sets are very different from regular DJ sets or computer-based live shows. Preparation and improvisation go hand in hand, as it requires continuous physical manipulation of the modules.

A typical configuration example for a live set would look like this:

- Percussion sound source (sine wave, noise, analog kick module)
- Baseline sequencer + VCO
- Effect chain (delay, reverb, distortion)
- Mixer module (real-time adjustment of multiple sound source balances)
- Clock module (overall tempo control)

This real-time nature is at the heart of Modular Techno's appeal.

# Scene and Culture

The development of the Modular Techno scene is not only influenced by musical factors, but also by club culture, the DIY spirit, and the development of the equipment community. Particularly since the 2000s, in electronic music cities such as Berlin, London, and Barcelona, ​​performance events and workshops centering on modular synths have been held frequently, allowing artists and audiences to share techniques and aesthetics with the same enthusiasm.

## Connection with club culture centered around Berlin

Berlin has served not only as an international hub for techno, but also as a testing ground for modular synth culture. Clubs such as Berghain, Tresor and Griessmuehle introduced a new performance format into the context of club culture, featuring modular artists in the framework of ""electroacoustic live'', which differed from DJ sets.

Additionally, Superbooth (a synthesizer exhibition held annually in Berlin) plays a decisive role in the development of modular culture. By bringing together numerous manufacturers, artists, and creators and directly sharing technical information and sound creation know-how, Modular Techno's sonic sophistication progressed rapidly.

</div>

## Spread of DIY/maker culture

The spread of the Eurorack standard has created an environment in which the number of manufacturers has increased and a variety of sound source and effect modules have been developed. A number of cutting-edge manufacturers have emerged, including Mutable Instruments, Make Noise, Intellijel, and ALM Busy Circuits, allowing artists to build systems that suit their musical needs.

This "build-your-own culture" matches the DIY spirit of techno, and is a factor in the formation of completely different sonic aesthetics for each artist.

# Musical characteristics and analysis

Modular Techno exhibits several common acoustic and structural characteristics. Below, we will classify the typical elements and explain what functions they play within the techno framework.

## 1. Rhythm "fluctuations" and stochastic changes

Traditional techno is centered around a steady 4/4 beat. On the other hand, modular synths often use stochastic sequencers that change values ​​at each step.
- A slightly different hi-hat every time
- Randomized base attack
- Modulation that deviates from the rhythm grid
This adds an element of ""shaking.''

This instability is a big part of Modular Techno's appeal, giving its mechanical rhythmic loops a freshness while still having a human feel.

## 2. Active use of noise and texture

The use of noise sources, random voltages, saturation, and FM modulation to create sonic surfaces (textures) is especially important in Modular Techno.

- gritty noise
- metallic resonance
- Irregular overtones due to inter-module feedback

By mixing these with the kick and bass line, a strong sense of density and substance is created.

## 3. "Fluidity" of structure

Modular Techno often takes an approach closer to "sound sculpture," in which the state of the sound continues to change slowly, rather than the traditional 16-bar development.

The layers of rhythm → texture → noise → bass transition smoothly over time. This structure also enhances connectivity with Ambient Techno, Drone, and Industrial.

# Criticism/Media Reception

In the early days, Modular Techno was considered too experimental and not suitable for clubs, but in the late 2010s, mainstream media and critics began to pay attention to its sonic sophistication.

- In reviews, modular's unique complex and three-dimensional sound image received high praise.
- In the live report, the improvisational and physical performance was highlighted.
- From a producer's perspective, it attracted a lot of interest as a new production method, and the number of teaching materials and courses increased.

The shift from ""track reproduction" to ""sound generation" has also influenced the performance theory of electronic music.

# Future outlook

Modular Techno is expected to continue to evolve, and several directions are expected.

## 1. Sophistication of digital module
Advances in DSP technology have led to an increase in digital modules equipped with physical modeling, particle synthesis, and complex FM algorithms. This makes it possible to handle acoustic expressions that were previously impossible in real time.

## 2. Generalization of hybrid live
The configuration of modular + PC (Ableton, Bitwig) + drum machine will become even more common, and the boundaries between traditional club sets and live performances will become blurred.

## 3. Deepening community culture
The community is maturing both online and offline, with module sharing, live patch releases, and an increase in educational content.
