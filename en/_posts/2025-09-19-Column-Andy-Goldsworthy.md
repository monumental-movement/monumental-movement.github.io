Andy Goldsworthy (1956-) is a British artist known for his installations and land art using natural materials. His work focuses on elements such as the passage of time, changes in materials, and the cycles of nature. His approach has much in common with music, especially ambient, field recording, and minimal music.

### Commonalities between Goldsworthy's work and music

| Themes | Goldsworthy's works | Similarities with music |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Time** | Works based on the premise of changes such as ice, leaves, branches, etc. melting or withering | Musical sense of time using phase shifts and loops (e.g. Steve Reich) |
| **Location** | Works are inseparable from the natural environment where they are created | Music that captures the "sounds of the place" through field recordings |
| **Transience** | Works that collapse due to wind, rain, and sunlight | Disappearing reverberations and fade-outs of sustained sounds |
| **Cycle** | Emphasizes the cycles of seasons and natural phenomena | Cyclical sense of time through drones and repetitive structures |
| **Silence** | The importance of space and interval | The presence of "silence" in John Cage and ambient works |

### Conclusion

Andy Goldsworthy's works have a ""once-in-time" quality that changes and disappears with time and nature. His aesthetic resonates strongly with the ""ambience," ""repetition," and ""silence" of ambient, field recording, and minimal music. By experiencing the two in combination, a ""dialogue with nature'' that crosses the visual and auditory senses is born.
