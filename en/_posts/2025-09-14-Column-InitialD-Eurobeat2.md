## Explore the cultural trajectory of "Initial D" as it accelerated Eurobeat and spread to the internet and street culture


Text: mmr｜Theme: "After" Eurobeat spreads from Initial D

<hr>


### Eurobeat's "exit" and "return"
""Initial D" was a definitive work that strongly imprinted Eurobeat on Japanese youth, and at the same time was an ""outlet" for that music to be recirculated to the Internet generation.
In the late 2000s, as Napster and YouTube became popular, anime clippings and fan-edited ""Eurobeat Drift Compilations" exploded in popularity. For young people in Europe and America, ""Initial D" became the ""entrance'' to Eurobeat, and conversely, music imported from Japan returned to the world, creating a double cycle.

### From the mountain pass to simulation —— Riders in the digital space
The mountain pass depicted in "Initial D" is a real mountain pass in Gunma, but since the 2000s, Eurobeat has been connected to a gaming culture that can be called a "digital mountain pass."
Eurobeat naturally flowed into arcade games such as ""Initial D Arcade Stage" and ""Wangan Midnight," as well as the home game ""Gran Turismo'' and online racing communities. The high-speed beat is not just background music that moves the car, but a catalyst that enhances the "virtual sense of acceleration" in the digital world.

### Acceleration of internet culture and memes
From the late 2000s to the 2010s, Eurobeat was absorbed into Internet meme culture with songs like "Deja Vu" and "Running in the 90s."
Amidst the trend of short-form videos, from YouTube Poop to MAD videos to TikTok, Eurobeat has transformed into a strange entity that is both a gag and a serious one.
This sense of speed and humor coexist functions as a ""rhythm of laughter that can be understood intuitively'' even for a generation that no longer knows Touge or anime.

### Inheritance of street culture and "running"
On the other hand, Eurobeat continues to be "street music". Eurobeat, which is played on the Shuto Expressway late at night, at drift events, and at tuning car meetings, has seeped into the real racing culture through Initial D.
Here, it functions not just as background music, but as a symbol to share the ""spirituality of driving." In other words, music survives not only as a recreation of the mountain pass, but also as a ""community password."

### To the generation that inherits the "memory of acceleration"
Today, many of the young people who click on the "Eurobeat – Initial D" playlist on Spotify or Apple Music have not necessarily run on mountain passes.
But they're accelerating in their headphones, drifting in virtual space, laughing on the internet and surrendering their bodies to the same sounds.
Eurobeat has become a medium that transcends physical speed and updates the ""memory of acceleration'' with each generation.

### Conclusion —— Music that keeps running
Even now, nearly 20 years after "Initial D" ended, Eurobeat continues unabated.
It is music that travels through mountain passes, music that travels through the internet, and music that accelerates memory and the body.

After all, Eurobeat is not just a genre name.
**"A device for storing speed itself as music"**
I think it is functioning as a.

Every time you press the play button, that curve is waiting for you.
