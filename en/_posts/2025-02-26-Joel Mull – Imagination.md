Joel Mull's debut album Imagination (2000) remains special to many listeners as the Swedish techno artist left a lasting impression on the scene.

Released early in his career, this album deftly fuses elements of minimal techno and tech house, developing a soundscape with a unique emotional depth.

First of all, it can be said that the biggest appeal of ""Imagination'' is its immersive feeling. Throughout the album, Joel Mull transports the listener on an otherworldly journey with delicate layers of rhythm and texture.
