A techno track released on MB Elektronics in 2006 by Greek techno DJ Spiros Kaloumenos, who is part of the Marco Bailey family active in the Spanish minimal techno scene and runs Omega Audio Recordings with techno DJ Axel Karakasis.

Spiros Kaloumeno was born in Piraeus, Greece, and at the age of 13 he realized that music, especially electronic music, was his priority in life.

He started his career as a radio producer and his radio show has grown to be broadcast on one of the largest dance music stations in Athens.

Afterwards, he produced a television program introducing music and video clips from the techno scene, worked on a dance music magazine, and played as a techno DJ at clubs in Athens and dance festivals in Greece.

As a producer, he began releasing music on Hydrophonic Recordings in the UK, and his production skills were quickly recognized, and he became a member of the Marco Bailey family, releasing numerous works on other labels as well.

In 2005, he founded his own label, Omega Audio Recordings, with long-time partner Axel Karakasis.
