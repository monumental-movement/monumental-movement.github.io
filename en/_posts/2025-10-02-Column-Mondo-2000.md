## Birth of “New Edge”

Text: mmr｜Theme: Genealogy, main contributors and activities of the grotesque and fascinating cyberculture magazine “Mondo 2000” born in the 1980s and 1990s


Mondo 2000 is a representative magazine that expresses cyberculture in an anarchic and psychedelic way. Its origins date back to 1984 with ``High Frontiers,'' followed by ``Reality Hackers,'' and in 1989 it became fully developed under the name ``Mondo 2000.'' The magazine featured themes such as ``biotech,'' ``virtual reality,'' ``smart drugs,'' and ``neo-psychedelia,'' with experimental graphics and irony.

### Who wrote it and what did they say?

Key editors and publishers include R. U. Sirius (Ken Goffman), Queen Mu (Alison Bailey Kennedy), and hacker and editor Jude Milhon (St. Jude). Contributors of the cyberpunk and techno culture of the time, including William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Rudy Looker, and Douglas Rushkoff, contributed to the book, presenting pop intelligence that traversed music, literature, and technology. Mondo 2000 had a more tingly anti-establishment and subculture-oriented aesthetic than its later debut, Wired.

### Appearance and design: photo collage and “new edge” aesthetics

Mondo 2000's identity lies in its surreal photo collages, vivid colors, and graphics that anticipate Photoshop collages. The art direction was handled by Bart Nagel and others, and the magazine used a collage-like layout that took advantage of ``information overload'' to provoke readers. These visual strategies have influenced later web culture and editorial design.

### Spread of activity — Magazines have created communities

Beyond the magazine, Mondo 2000 also expanded its network through events, interviews, and collaborations. The editorial team connected with techno/club culture, psychedelic research, and transhumanism, forming much of the subcultural vocabulary of the 90s. The last print issue ran until 1998, and archived back issues are available online.
