title: Cursor Miner – Remote Control
---


Cursor Miner is a project by Rob Tubb (real name Rob Tubb).

Cursor Miner is a mix of pure dancefloor anthems, twisted breakbeats, insane experimentation, pop flair, and social commentary.

He's been described as Beck and David Bowie fused with Kraftwerk and Oetaker, what would happen in the middle of an illegal early 90s rave.
