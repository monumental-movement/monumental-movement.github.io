Kronos Quartet is a string quartet formed in Seattle in 1973 by violinist David Harrington, and has been based in San Francisco since 1978. 

The band has been active for 50 years with a rotating cast of musicians, with the longest-running combination of performers (1978-1999) being Harrington and John Schaba on violin, Hank Dutt on viola, and Joan Jeanrenot on cello.

The quartet covers a very wide range of musical genres, including contemporary classical music.
