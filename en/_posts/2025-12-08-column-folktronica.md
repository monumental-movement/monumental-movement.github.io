## A new form of song for the 21st century created by acoustic and electronic music

Text: mmr｜Theme: About the history, techniques, influences, equipment, and musical characteristics of Folk-Tronica/Indietronica, with a focus on Four Tet, Caribou, and Bonobo.

Folk-Tronica/Indietronica is a hybrid musical trend of the 21st century and beyond, where the simple sounds of acoustic instruments intersect with the textures of electronic sounds.
It was born from the marriage of folk melodies, guitar arpeggios, field recordings of natural sounds, and laptop electronica sampling culture.

Some of the artists who clearly presented this genre to the world include **Four Tet (Kieran Hebden)**, **Caribou (Daniel Snaith)**, and **Bonobo (Simon Green)**.
Although they all have a background in electronic music, they have expanded the context of electronica since the 2000s by sampling and reconstructing a variety of music such as jazz, folk, ethnic music, and post-rock.

**Music that integrates folk (acoustic melodies and songs) and electronica (beats/samples/digital editing)**.

Main features:
- Extensive use of live recordings of acoustic guitars, string instruments, and percussion instruments
- Digital editing (cut-up, granular processing)
- Field recording texture
- Simple but emotional melody
- Coexistence of "touch" and "artificial objects"

### ■ What is Indietronica?
The flow of introducing electronic music into the context of indie rock.
While Folk-Tronica was based on folk elements, Indietronica has a strong direction of **band sound + electronics**.

Examples: The Postal Service, Hot Chip, Múm, etc.

- Turning manual sounds into rhythmic materials
Example: Four Tet is known for their editing of everyday sounds.

### (2) Sampling and cut-up of live instruments
- Chop and loop guitar chords
- Edit piano sounds in very small units
- Granular processing of stringed instruments to create pads

### (3) Electronic beat and acoustic rhythm blend
- minimal beats on laptop
- Layer live percussion
- Add a sense of unity with compression and side chaining

### (4) Mix characteristics
- Focus on warmth in the midrange
