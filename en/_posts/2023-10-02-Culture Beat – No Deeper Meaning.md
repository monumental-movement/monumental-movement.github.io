"No Deeper Meaning" was recorded by Jay Supreme and Nosie Katzmann's German Eurodance band Culture Beat and released as the fourth and final single from their first studio album, Horizon (1991).

The female vocals were provided by Lana Earl and reached number 4 in the Netherlands and number 9 in Portugal. Outside Europe, it ranked 3rd on Canada's RPM Dance/Urban chart.

The song is about a woman who doesn't want to go to a nightclub and start a relationship, she just wants to dance. The chorus samples the 1983 song "Change" by the British rock group Tears for Fears.
