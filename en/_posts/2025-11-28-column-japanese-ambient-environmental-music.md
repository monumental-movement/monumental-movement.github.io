## **Introduction: Until silence covers the world**

Text: mmr｜Theme: The core of Japanese environmental music from the 1980s and its historical reappraisal


In the late 2010s, "Japanese Ambient" and "Japanese Environmental Music" began to attract a lot of attention among music listeners around the world. There are multiple reasons. These are reissues by Western labels, YouTube"s automatic recommendations, Spotify"s algorithm, and a reappraisal of electronic music/new age.
However, there are important points that cannot be explained by these factors alone.

This is the fact that Japan's ""environmental music'' in the 1980s was born from a different cultural soil than ambient music around the world.
While Western ambient music (beginning with Brian Eno) aimed at "sounds that melt into the background without stealing attention," Japanese environmental music was closely connected to ""urban planning, architecture, commercial spaces, product design, art, consumer electronics culture, and philosophy of life.''

The following composers were at the center of this.

- **Hiroshi Yoshimura**
- **Midori Takada**
- **Takashi Kokubo**
- **Inoyamaland**

# **Chapter 1: Formation of the concept of "environmental music" in Japan**

## ● 1-1. 1970s: Experimental ground for electronic music and contemporary music

The emergence of Japanese ambient music paralleled the development of electronic music studios in the 1970s. Many universities and research institutes were researching electronic acoustics, tape music, and musique concrète, and at the same time, ""sound installations'' increased in the field of contemporary art.

While studying spatial art at an art university, Hiroshi Yoshimura began creating works that linked the environment and sound from an early stage, and was also involved in acoustic planning for public spaces.

Japanese ambient music is characterized by being formed at the intersection of these **arts, sound engineering, and urban planning**.

## ● 1-2. "Environmental Music Series" by MUJI

In the early 1980s, MUJI aimed at ""music for consumers" and planned a series of ""environmental music" for store spaces.
Hiroshi Yoshimura, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and others participated in this series, which triggered a major change in the role of sound in commercial spaces.

The feature was that it not only functioned as store background music, but was also designed to be of high quality.

## ● 1-3. Urbanization and the aesthetics of "tranquility"

In the 1980s, Japan experienced rapid economic growth and urbanization, but in the fields of architecture and design, ""quietness," ""white space," and ""simplicity'' were talked about as virtues.

- white wall
- Minimal design using wood
- "Beauty of simplicity" symbolized by MUJI
- Zen space design

These environmental philosophies were linked to music and formed the basis for Japan's unique "environmental music."
