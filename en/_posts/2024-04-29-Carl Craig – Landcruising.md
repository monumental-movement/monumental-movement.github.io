Carl Craig is a member of the second generation of Detroit techno, discovered by Derrick May, who is known as one of the founders of Detroit techno along with Kevin Saunderson and Juan Atkins.

He creates a sound that incorporates various elements such as innovative ambient, techno, breakbeat, and future jazz.

"Landcruising", released in 2005 by WEA's subsidiary Blanco Y Negro, is Carl Craig's first album and is considered a masterpiece. In 2005, the album was remastered, remixed, and new songs added, and was released under the title ``The Album Formerly Known As...'' by the RushHour label, and was reevaluated.
