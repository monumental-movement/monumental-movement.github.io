  sounds that are heard'

## From "music to listen to" to "music to feel"

Text: mmr｜Theme: Ambient, environmental music, electronic music culture theory

Ambient is a genre of music that is not intended to be "actively listened to" by listeners, but rather to "exist in a space." He eliminates clear melodies and rhythms and instead uses sustained sounds (drones), environmental sounds (field recordings), and acoustic processing to construct auditory landscapes.

This genre is extremely philosophical music that stands on the border between music and art, sound and space, perception and consciousness.

### From the words of Brian Eno

It was British musician Brian Eno who defined the term ambient as a musical genre. In 1978, he wrote the following in his masterpiece [Ambient 1: Music for Airports] (https://amzn.to/48shEpU):

"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting."
""Ambient music must not force itself to be heard, but at the same time allow itself to be ignored.''

In other words, ambient music is not background music, but it functions like background music. **It is "spatial art" that flows in the background of consciousness**.

### Genealogy and origins of ambient

### Ambient is the intersection of "music" and "space"

Ambient is music that is not at the center of the music, but at the periphery. It is an art that deals not with melody or rhythm, but with the transformation of atmosphere, time, sensation, and consciousness.

It is a sound that transcends the framework of music and enters the silence amidst the noise of the city and the gaps between memories. Rather than hearing it with your ears, it's a sound that you can feel in a space.
