### Summary

The history of post-rock/ambient music has been a series of challenges: ""How to depict space and time with sound beyond the framework of rock.'' From tape experiments in the 1970s to AI music in the 2020s, the evolution is shifting from the "materiality of sound" to the "environmental nature of sound."
The future will be further updated with ""immersive sound architecture'' that connects generative AI and physical sensations.
