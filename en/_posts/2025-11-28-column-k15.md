# Introduction — Why "Eglo × K15" now?

Text: mmr｜Theme: Unraveling the history of EGLO's main artist K15, his views on music, and his signature song "Sunbeams"


In London's underground music scene, **K15 (real name: Kieron Ifill)** has been recognized as a band that gracefully straddles the gap between club music and spiritual jazz. Although his music crosses genres such as house, broken beat, jazz, soul, and electronica, it always has a pure "temperature".
The combination of experimentation and warmth is surprisingly similar to the aesthetics of the label **EGLO Records**.

In the club/dance music scene, there is often talk of ""trends" and ""the ups and downs of a genre." However, among these labels and works that remain over time, there is a ""thought" and ""community" that is more than just a trend.

Eglo Records, founded in London by Floating Points and Alexander Nut, is a representative independent label that emphasizes continuity and diversity.

In Eglo"s catalog, K15"s ""Sunbeams'' is a unique and iconic work that combines elements of house, broken beat, Latin, and jazz. Why this work was created and what meaning it has - digging into its background and context is important when considering the overall picture of Eglo and the crossroads of modern dance/jazz/soul.

In this article, we will thoroughly delve into K15's musical background, their connection with EGLO, the evolution of each work, and even the iconic track **"Sunbeams"** in a long column format based on facts.

## Positioning of K15 in London

K15 has worked extensively within London's underground music community as a club DJ, keyboard player and beat maker. Beyond the context of house and techno, it is recognized as an entity that bridges the gap between jazz and club music.

His distinctive feature is that while maintaining the intensity of a club, his melodies have a spiritual jazz flavor.
Even before London's new-generation jazz movement became visible, K15 was incorporating its seeds into his own work.

## EGLO Records and K15

### ■ What is EGLO?
Founded in 2009 by Floating Points and Alexander Nut, EGLO Records has become a hub for London"s diverse music culture. It"s a label that symbolizes a scene where jazz, soul, deep house, and broken beat naturally mix.

### ■ Connection between K15 and EGLO
In the mid-2010s, K15 began to develop their own music while resonating with EGLO"s artists. His warm chord progressions, elegant keyboards, and soft drum programming perfectly matched the label"s organic atmosphere.

## Early works and musical foundations

K15's early works often featured broken beats with lo-fi textures and jazzy beats centered on keyboards.
Already from this period,
- **Detailed hi-hat**
- **Rounded kick drum**
- **Impressive electric piano chords**
- **Spiritual Ascent**
The following characteristics were observed.

This aesthetic was later strengthened and refined in EGLO's works.

## K15 Musical Aesthetics: Integrating Jazz and Electronic Music

What cannot be overlooked when talking about K15's music is their ability to naturally integrate jazz idioms into club music.

- **Chord progression is jazz-like**
- **Rhythm is broken beat or deep house**
- **Textures are soulful and organic**

His style seems to place more emphasis on the ""temperature of the sound" and ""the presence of people" than on music theory, and even though it is a digital production, it retains the feel of a live performance.
