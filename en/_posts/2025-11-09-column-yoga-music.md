## Introduction: Yoga meets music


Text: mmr | Theme: A comprehensive exploration of the historical background, scientific basis, cultural influences, and modern practices of yoga and music

Yoga is more than just a physical exercise; it is an ancient wisdom that integrates the mind and body. Its origins date back to the Vedic period, around 1500 B.C., when the recitation of mantras and poetry was closely associated with meditation and religious rituals. The sound vibrations played a role in calming the mind and sharpening the physical senses.

For example, chanting ""Om'' (ॐ) causes the low-pitched vibrations to resonate throughout the body, which has the effect of regulating breathing and heartbeat. Ragas (combinations of scales) in Indian classical music were used as a means to adjust the state of mind and body depending on the season and time of day.

Even today, yoga and music are inseparable. In the studio, meditative background music, natural sounds, and ambient music are played in conjunction with breathing exercises and asanas, making it easier for even beginners to enter a state of concentration. The integration of breathing, movement, and musical rhythm naturally creates harmony between mind and body.

## Chapter 1: Ancient Rhythm and Spirituality {#chapter1}

In ancient India, yoga and music were closely linked and were central to spiritual practice. During the Vedic period, the recitation of sacred poems and mantras was central to meditation, and the sound itself was thought to have spiritual power. Sound vibrations facilitated the integration of physical sensations and mind, facilitating a state of concentration.

### Indian classical music and yoga

Indian classical music, which is composed of ragas (scale systems) and tala (rhythm systems), is effective in awakening the physical senses and inducing a state of concentration when combined with yoga meditation and breathing techniques. Ragas were played in the morning to promote vitality, while relaxing ragas were used for evening meditation.

### Harmony of Mantra and Breathing

In ancient yoga, the harmonization of breathing (pranayama) and the rhythm of sound was important. Mantras are chanted in time with the length and depth of the breath and are felt as vibrations within the body. This process aligns your heartbeat and brainwaves, increasing concentration and inner calm.

### Spirituality and the power of sound

The yoga scripture ""Yoga Sutra"' mentions sound and chanting as a method of controlling the mind to achieve concentration (samadhi). Sound vibrations isolate one"s consciousness from the noise of the outside world and provide a means of confronting one's inner self. Ancient practitioners harnessed the power of sound to integrate the body and mind.

## Chapter 2: Modern Yoga and Music Therapy {#chapter2}

From the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, Indian yoga was introduced to the West and attracted attention as a spiritual and health method. Music was incorporated as a complementary element to yoga practice and became the prototype for later music therapy and New Age music.

### Penetration into the West

Modern yoga, based on the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and others, spread in America and Europe. Western audiences were exposed to traditional Indian music and mantras, and developed an interest in meditation and peace of mind. Music went beyond simply introducing culture and was accepted as a means of having psychological and spiritual effects.

### Application as music therapy

In the early 20th century, music therapy began to attract attention in the fields of psychology and medicine in the West. A practice that combines yoga and music was rated as effective in reducing stress, improving concentration, and regulating body and mind balance. Music based on mantras and rhythms enhanced psychological stability by synchronizing breathing and movement.

### Birth of new age music

Since the 1970s, new age music for meditation and healing purposes has appeared. Songs using synthesizers and natural sounds were incorporated into yoga asanas and meditation, bringing spiritual depth. The combination of yoga and music has been established as an integrated approach that promotes health, spirituality, and personal growth.

## Chapter 3: Modern Yoga and Music {#chapter3}

In the 21st century, yoga has become widely popular around the world. It is being incorporated into daily life through urban studios and online services. Music supports the rhythm of breathing and movement and promotes concentration and relaxation.

### BGM usage in the studio

In modern yoga studios, the choice of background music influences the atmosphere of the class. Gentle ambient and natural sounds help beginners focus on their breathing and relieve psychological tension. For dynamic flows such as vinyasa yoga, rhythmic music with a tempo and songs with a strong bass are suitable.

### Fusion with EDM, Lo-Fi, Ambient

In recent years, attempts to combine EDM, Lo-Fi, and Ambient music with yoga have also increased. Lo-Fi hip-hop in particular combines calming beats with ambient sounds to create a space suitable for meditation or static poses.

### Trinity of breathing, movement, and music

By being aware of the trinity of breathing techniques (pranayama), poses (asana), and music, it is possible to synchronize the BPM to the poses in dynamic yoga, and to play music that matches the frequency and rhythm during meditation. It promotes concentration and inner calm, maximizing the benefits of yoga.
