## History and masterpieces of Experimental Music


Text: mmr｜Theme: Changes in experimental music from the avant-garde to the post-digital era


"Experimental music" was born as an attempt to deviate from traditional harmonies and forms and explore the possibilities of sound itself. It began with the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century, which transcended the framework of classical music, and continues to expand to include electronic acoustics, industrial, noise, and modern digital music. Here, we will organize the historical background, famous records, and changes in equipment by decade, and trace the trajectory of experimental music.

## The future of experimental music
Experimental music has always continued to expand the boundaries of music. Starting from prepared piano and tape experiments in the 1940s, to noise and industrial in the 70s, to digital glitch in the 90s, to AI-generated music in the 2020s, it's constantly changing.

The essence of experimental music is unpredictability and a spirit of exploration. Even outside of commercial music, its influence pervades rock, club music, contemporary music, and pop, making it a force to be reckoned with.

In the future, even the concept of "music" may change due to the fusion of AI, brain wave interfaces, and VR/AR.
**Experimental music is a mirror that predicts the future, and will continue to present "new horizons of sound" to both listeners and creators. **
