## Hybrid beat born in the city

Text: mmr｜Theme: Thoughts on Drum & Bass/Jungle/UK sound

Drum & Bass (D&B) is a music genre born in London's underground club scene in the early 1990s, and at the same time is the very rhythm of multicultural city life.Combining fast breakbeats, roaring bass lines, and reggae/dub/hip-hop/techno, they revolutionized UK music history.

Its evolution has been incredible, with many branches ranging from jungle, liquid funk, and techstep to neurofunk, jump-up, and drumstep.

### From Jungle to D&B

**● 1990-1993: Jungle movement**

D&B's roots lie in the jungle genre.This was a chaotic beat music that was a mix of acid house, rave, hip-hop, and reggae, and centered around a sampling of Amen Break.
