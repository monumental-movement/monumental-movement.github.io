## What is IDM?


Text: mmr｜Theme: From the birth of IDM to the present

A labyrinth of sounds that tickles intellectual curiosity - IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) is a genre that was born out of the experimental spirit of techno and ambient music in the early 1990s, going beyond the boundaries of club music and opening up a new realm of ""electronic music for listening.'' Emphasizing complex rhythms, precise acoustic processing, and original sound design over functionality on the dance floor, it embodies the fusion of technology and artistry. This trend continues from pioneers such as Aphex Twin and Autechre to the modern experimental electronic music scene.

## Early 1990s: Birth - The germ of "dance music for listening"
At the end of the 1980s, in the midst of the UK rave culture and techno craze, underground labels and artists began to explore electronic music for home listening, rather than just a club tool.
The ""Artificial Intelligence" series released by Warp Records in 1992 was a decisive turning point, and the name ""IDM" became widespread.

- **Representative masterpiece**
- Aphex Twin – *Selected Ambient Works 85-92* (1992)
- Autechre – *Incunabula* (1993)
- The Orb – *U.F.Orb* (1992)
- Black Dog Productions – *Bytes* (1993)

- **Equipment characteristics**
In addition to Roland TR-808, 909, and TB-303, samplers such as **Akai S1000** and sequencer environments such as **Atari ST + Cubase** were frequently used, making it possible to construct complex beats.

## The spirit of acoustic experimentation itself
IDM has gone beyond the framework of ""dance music for intellectual listening'' and has evolved into the very spirit of sonic experimentation.
Although it started outside clubs, it has now found its way back into club and pop music, and its aesthetic is sprinkled throughout contemporary electronic music.
