## Raja Ram × Simon Posford: Encounter and chemical reaction

Text: mmr｜Theme: Philosophy of the acoustic universe drawn by Raja Ram and Simon Posford

Shpongle is a monumental psychedelic electronica/psychedelic project centered around Simon Posford and Raja Ram. Formed in 1996, inspired by the total solar eclipse in India, they have presented an "audio-journey" that fuses ethnic sampling, acoustic instrumentation, and masterful studio production. Their sound image is distinct from club-oriented trance, and invites listeners to a story that transcends time and space.

## Prologue: Sound is the door to enlightenment

Shpongle is more than just an electronic music unit.
It is the spiritual pinnacle of modern electronic music, embodying **Sound Enlightenment**.

The members are psychedelic sage Raja Ram (formerly of Quintessence) and sound magician Simon Posford (Hallucinogen).
The band was born in 1996 from a chance session at Twisted Records studios outside London.
Their sound is a unique "mandala of sound" that combines consciousness, meditation, vision, philosophy, and technology.

> "Shpongle is the experience of enlightenment through hearing."
> — Simon Posford

## Chapter 1: Birth of Shpongle and historical background of Twisted Records

In the 1990s, British psychedelic culture was at a crossroads in its evolution.
A time when the Goa Trance craze swept Europe and LSD culture merged with technology.
At the center of this trend was Twisted Records (1996-).

Twisted releases spiritual and intellectual trance music centered on Posford, including Hallucinogen, Younger Brother, Prometheus, and Celtic Cross.
Shpongle was born with the theme of "journey into the inner universe" at its core.

Twisted served as the 'intellectual mecca' of UK psychedelic culture.
This is not a drug fantasy, but a scientific exploration of sound and consciousness.
Shpongle was its philosophical symbol.

#### Shpongletron: Mandala of sound and light

During the live performance, a huge video device called Shpongletron is used.
Android Jones' visuals are synchronized with the sound.
Raja Ram will be on stage as a ""ceremonial guru'' and Posford will be a ""sound alchemist.''
The live performance itself becomes an extension of the meditative experience.

## Chapter 5: History of Thought and Hindu Philosophy of Raja Ram

#### From hippie culture to sonic yoga

In the late 1960s, Raja Ram led Quintessence, introducing Hindu philosophy to rock music.
He musically put into practice the ideas that ""sound = enlightenment'' and ""sound = god (Nāda Brahma).''

| Hindu Philosophy | Musical Correspondence |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| **Brahman** | Creative energy of sound |
| **Maya (Phantom)** | Sound changes and multilayering |
| **Atman (I)** | Inner consciousness of the listener |
| **Lila (play)** | Humor and transformation in the song |
| **Nāda (sound)** | Vibration of the universe = sound itself |

For Raja Ram, sound is prayer and Shpongle is his mantra.

## Chapter 6: Simon Posford - The Sound Magician's Production Philosophy

Posford combines classic synths (Virus, Nord Lead, Roland SH-101) with modern DAWs (Logic Pro, Ableton).
Dozens of layers of sound are layered to intentionally design "resonance with brain waves."
His works have a consistent three-layered structure: low range = body, overtones = consciousness, and reverberation = spirituality.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Yl-hUHbeGA?si=7A0asG2o9izwVN6c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

---

#### Production workflow example

- Sampling of natural and ethnic sounds

- Microtonal processing (Detuning) on synths

- Phase inversion and reverse reverb

- Synced to brainwave rhythm (Theta/Alpha)

- Reconstruction in 3D space (Ambisonics)

> "Rather than creating sounds, I feel like guiding the sounds that appear."
> — Simon Posford

## Chapter 7: Comparative analysis with Young Brother / Hallucinogen

| Project | Direction | Spirituality | Sound Characteristics |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Hallucinogen** | External Hallucination | Chemical Trance | BPM Fast/Sharp |
| **Younger Brother** | Inner spiritual exploration | Emotions/Lyrics | Organic/Pop-oriented |
| **Shpongle** | Fusion of consciousness and space | Philosophy/Spirituality | Super-constructive/multilayered acoustics |

## Chapter 8: Nāda Brahma and Sound Meditation Practices

#### What is Nāda Brahma?

> "The universe is sound, and sound is God."

This ancient Indian philosophy is the basis of Shpongle.
Sound is born, changes, disappears, and regenerates again.
That is reincarnation itself.

#### Shpongle-style acoustic meditation method

- Breathe in the dark room

- Play Divine Moments of Truth

- Focus on the moment when the sound is "born"

- The layers of sound expand and boundaries disappear.

- Listen to your inner voice when you reach silence

Scientifically, alpha and theta waves become dominant, leading to a deep meditative state.
The sound of Shpongle is like a temple bell in the brain.

## Chapter 9: Resonance with psychedelic visuals

Shpongle is completed not only by sound but also by resonance with visual art.
He is especially famous for his collaborations with Android Jones (digital vision painter) and Alex Gray (spiritual painter).

---

| Artist | Works/Relationship | Features |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| **Android Jones** | Shpongletron Visual | Visual Mandala Generation |
| **Alex Grey** | Sharing the theme of "sound = light = consciousness" | Fusion expression of the human body and the universe |

## Chapter 10: Shpongle's Psychoacoustics - Interaction of the Brain and Consciousness

Posford constructs sound as a neurological ritual.
The undulating bass resonates with heart rate variability, and the overtones of the flute stimulate the pineal gland in the brain.
This structure causes a psychological phenomenon called an "acoustic trip."

---

| Acoustic elements | Physiological effects | Psychological experiences |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| Low frequency base | Synchronization of breathing and heartbeat | Grounding feeling |
| High-frequency overtones | Pineal gland activity | Visual hallucinations/time dilation |
| Reverb reverberation | Expansion of spatial localization | Dissolution of ego |
| Polyrhythm | Cognitive delay | Dreamy floating feeling |

Scientifically, Shpongle is a project to ""restructure the brain with sound.''

---

## Final Chapter: Enlightenment as Sound - Significance of Shpongle's existence

says Raja Ram.

> "I am a sound traveler. Instead of searching for God, I wake up in sound."

Shpongle is a 21st century scripture born at the intersection of technology and spirituality.
Electronic sounds become mantras, beats become meditation, and listening becomes prayer.

Sound is born, changes, returns to silence, and is revived again.
This endless cycle is the ""Saṃsāra of Sound,'' and it is the very world that Shpongle depicts.

> "Nothing Lasts... But Nothing Is Lost."
> - Everything disappears, but nothing is lost.

## Conclusion

Shpongle is the 21st century embodiment of "enlightenment through sound."
The sound transcends science, philosophy, religion, and technology.
He is reconstructing human consciousness itself as sound.

It's not just music.
It is the evolution of the act of "listening" itself,
It is the mandala of consciousness left to humanity by Raja Ram and Simon Posford.

> "Sound is born, disappears, and returns again. That's what Shpongle is."
