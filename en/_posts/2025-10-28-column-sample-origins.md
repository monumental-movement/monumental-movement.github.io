### Prologue: Tracing the DNA of sound


Text: mmr｜Theme: Based on data such as **WhoSampled**, we will highlight the ""20 most sampled sound sources'' and explore how each has been etched into music history.


Sampling is a technology that most directly embodies ""quotation" and ""reconstruction" in the history of music. From the early days of hip-hop in the late '70s to today's electronica, a single drum break, bassline, or scream has been transformed into hundreds or thousands of songs.

#### 1. The Winstons – "Amen, Brother" (1969)
Commonly known as "**Amen Break**". The six-second drum solo spawned countless genres, including hip-hop, jungle, drum and bass, and hardcore techno. Producers everywhere from N.W.A. and Public Enemy to Aphex Twin and The Prodigy carved out this break.
Former drummer Gregory Coleman passed away without a reward, but the ""spirit of the groove'' that dwells between the snare and the hi-hat continues to resonate.

#### 2. Lyn Collins – "Think (About It)" (1972)
Produced by James Brown. A woman"s powerful shout and "Woo! Yeah!" break symbolize the golden age of hip-hop. Quotes include Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock"s "It Takes Two," as well as Snoop Dogg and Beyoncé.
Combining the strength of feminism and the dynamism of funk, it caused a "chain reaction of voices" on the club floor.

#### 3. The Clash – "Straight to Hell" (1982)
The melancholy guitar and percussion resurface in M.I.A.'s "Paper Planes." Lyrics about immigration, labor, and loneliness echo 21st century political hip-hop.

Clyde Stubblefield's drum break is the holy grail of sampling. Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Prince, Beastie Boys -- every time that snare hit, the era was renewed.

The cowbell and bell sound of the drums was distinctive, and it was loved by Run-D.M.C., Beastie Boys, Eric B. & Rakim, and others.

#### 8. Incredible Bongo Band – "Apache" (1973)

### Conclusion: Rhythm is forever cyclical

Sampling is the act of borrowing someone else's time to talk about a new era.
Behind this is the breathing of nameless musicians, the noise of equipment, and the inheritance of culture.
""The same sound coming back again and again'' is proof of the evolution of pop music, and is the most humane technology that connects the past and the future.
