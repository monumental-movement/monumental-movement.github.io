# Relationship between science fiction movies and music

Music in science fiction movies is more than just a "background" that supports the story. It has become an essential element in expressing a sense of the future, a sense of another world, and the gap between technology and humanity. In this article, we will provide detailed explanations from four perspectives: historical background, musical methods, representative works and composers, and influence on modern times.

## Historical background

### Silent era ~ 1950s

* **1927 Metropolis**: A silent film directed by Fritz Lang depicting a futuristic city. Orchestral accompaniment and contemporary musical techniques were used to embody the inorganic nature of the futuristic city through sound.
* **1950s science fiction film boom**: ""War of the Worlds" and ""Forbidden Planet" introduced electronic musical instruments (such as the theremin) in earnest, giving audiences a sense of the unknown.

### 1970s-80s

* **1977 Star Wars**: John Williams' symphonic score gave the space opera an epic grandeur.
* **Blade Runner, 1982**: Vangelis's synthesizer music symbolized the urban neon lights and rain-soaked dystopia.

### 1990s-2000s

* **1995 Ghost in the Shell**: Kenji Kawai's fusion of folk music and electronic music embodies a ""post-human'' world.
* **2001 ""A.I." and ""Minority Report" **: John Williams once again brought classical structure to life, giving a humanistic lyricism to the city of the future.

### Since 2010s

* **2014 Interstellar**: Hans Zimmer combines pipe organ and synth to simultaneously depict the grandeur of the universe and the inner lives of humans.
* **2021 "DUNE/Dune"**: A desert planet is expressed with folk music elements + electronic sound, creating an alien-like foreignness.
