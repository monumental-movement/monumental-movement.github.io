## Prologue: Shaking beats, bouncing bass—what is UK garage?


Text: mmr｜Theme: UK garage nurtured in the underground of London in the 90s. Tracing its birth, transformation, and the intersection of club culture

In the mid-1990s, there was a sonic revolution quietly underway in London's underground clubs.
Its name is "UK Garage". Based on American Garage House, they have established a unique "shuffling rhythm" by combining jungle rhythms, R&B vocals, and Jamaican sound system culture.

This new sound was more than just a genre of club music, it served as an expression of urban multiculturalism and immigrant communities. UK garage eventually branched out into **2-Step, Speed ​​Garage, Grime, and Dubstep**, becoming the cornerstone of current UK bass culture.

## Chapter 1: Roots—American Garage and UK Reinterpretation

The origins of UK garage can be traced back to the **US Garage House** that flourished in the late 1980s, namely the New York deep house produced by **Larry Levan** and **Todd Terry**.
The sound made its way to the UK, where club DJs, particularly in London, transformed it into a faster, more swinging sound.

After ""Second Summer of Love" in 1988, rave culture spread, and in an environment that mixed house, jungle, and breakbeats, a demographic emerged that sought ""music that was soulful but not too hard." This later became the breeding ground for UK garage.

## Chapter 2: Birth of Speed ​​Garage and 2-Step

### Emergence of Speed ​​Garage (1996-1998)
Early UK garages were known as **Speed ​​Garage**. This is a style of American house with a **jungle bassline**, and some typical tracks include:

- **Double 99 – "RipGroove" (1997)**
- **Tuff Jam – "Need Good Love" (1997)**
- **Armand Van Helden – "Sugar is Sweeter (Remix)" (1996)**

There is. Speed ​​Garage rocked the club floor with its balance of sub-bass swells and vocal chops.

### Transition to 2-Step (1998-2000)
Gradually, the four-on-one kick was omitted, and the swinging beat became dominant.
This was the **2-Step Garage**, led by **Artful Dodger**, **MJ Cole**, **Craig David** and others.

- **Artful Dodger feat. Craig David – "Re-Rewind" (1999)**
- **MJ Cole – "Sincere" (2000)**

These songs, at the intersection of R&B melodies and UK rhythms, dominated the radio and charts.

## Chapter 3: Clubs and pirate radio—the infrastructure of UKG culture

UK garage wasn't just music, it was supported by a network of media and club culture.

### Main clubs
- **Twice As Nice (London)**: A symbolic club where blacks, whites, and Asians meet.
- **La Cosa Nostra (Soho)**: Played by many early 2-Step DJs.
- **Sidewinder (national tour format)**: Expanded with MC culture.

### Pirate Radio Station
- **Rinse FM**, **Deja Vu FM**, **Flex FM**
Although these were pirate stations without legal broadcasting rights, they played a decisive role in the spread of UKG. From here, **So Solid Crew** and **Heartless Crew** emerged.

---

## Chapter 4: Fusion of MC and vocal culture

One of the important characteristics of UK garage is the coexistence of MC and vocalist.
The tradition of ""toasting"' inherited from Jamaican sound system culture was translated into London"s MC style.

Representative MC/crew:
- **MC Neat & DJ Luck**
- **So Solid Crew**
- **Ms Dynamite**
- **Heartless Crew**

In live recordings from this period, MCs would improvise to stir up the crowd, mixing in rap and slang to create a sense of unity in the club.
This phenomenon of ""sound and voice becoming one'' became the foundation for the later birth of Grime.

---

## Chapter 5: Early 2000s—Mainstreaming and fragmentation

Around 2000, UK garage entered its golden age on the charts.
**Craig David**'s ""Born To Do It" (2000) reached number 1 in the UK, and 2-Step became popular in pop music. However, at the same time, a backlash against ""commercialization" arose.

From 2001 to 2003, a more aggressive and dark sound emerged in clubs. This became the starting point for later **Grime** and **Dubstep**.

| Branch | Features | Representative Artist |
|------|------|-------------------|
| **Grime** | Around BPM140, MC-based hard sound | Wiley, Dizzee Rascal |
| **Dubstep** | Emphasis on bass, dark space | Skream, Benga, Digital Mystikz |
| **Bassline** | 4/4 return, pop vocals | T2, DJ Q |

## Chapter 6: Social Background——Multi-layered culture of London, a city of immigrants

UK Garage is music developed mainly by young people of black, Caribbean, and Asian descent.
It is this diversity that creates the ""fluctuation'' of the rhythm.

- **Afro-Caribbean rhythm** (derived from jungle and reggae)
- **American R&B melody**
- **The DIY spirit of British cities**

This intersection formed the UK's unique sonic identity.
The UKG party was also a common space that transcended class and race, and served as a means of positive expression for young people in response to the social unrest at the time (riots, unemployment, policies under the Blair government).

## Chapter 7: Succession and Revival—20 Years Since UKG

From the late 2010s to the 2020s, UK garage will undergo a wave of reappraisal.
Disclosure, Burial, Jamie xx and others are reimagining it in a modern way, re-projecting the spirit of UKG into lo-fi and Future Garage.

- **Burial – "Archangel" (2007)**
- **Disclosure – "Latch" (2012)**
- **Joy Orbison – "Hyph Mngo" (2009)**

Furthermore, with the hit **Eliza Rose – "B.O.T.A." ​​(2022)**, 2-Step rhythms once again dominated the charts.
It has begun to reach young people not only in clubs but also through social networking sites such as TikTok.

---

## Chapter 8: A volatile future—What UKG has left behind

UK garage transcends genre boundaries and has taken root as the ""urban rhythmic language.''
Its characteristics of ""bouncing beats," ""human deviations," and ""fragments of voices'' still pulsate throughout UK bass culture.

From underground to mainstream and back to underground——
The history of UK garage is a cycle of urban music itself.
