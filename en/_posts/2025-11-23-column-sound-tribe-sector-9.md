## The avant-garde of 21st century live music where improvisation and electronic music intersect

Text: mmr｜Theme: History of STS9 from its formation to the present, musical characteristics, live philosophy, representative works, and cultural and social influence


Sound Tribe Sector 9 (*STS9*) is known as a representative of "livetronica", which has undergone a unique evolution in the American live scene from the late 1990s to the present.
Their music is a fusion of the improvisational nature of a jam band, the structure and texture of electronic music, and the groove of club culture, making them different from just a rock band or an electronic music unit.

Their stance has always been that ""music = an experience in a live space,'' and they have placed emphasis on autonomous community formation, from production to tour management, stage direction, and social activities.

# 1. History before formation (~1997): "Neither a band nor a DJ" style born around Atlanta

The origins of STS9 can be traced back to the mid-1990s, when musicians active in the Atlanta area formed
**"Is it possible to create the atmosphere that a DJ creates in a club with live music?"**
It is said that it started with this question.

The members had a wide range of backgrounds, including rock, jazz, funk, electronic music, and even world music. In particular, the "groove-first ensemble" emphasized by the drum/percussion team became an important core that has continued from the beginning to the present.

Around 1997, a rare
**Electronica x Live Ensemble**
This direction was formed and the name Sound Tribe Sector 9 was started.

# 2. 1998–2002: Early works and adaptation to touring culture
## 2-1. Debut Era ― *Interplanetary Escape Vehicle* (1998)

Their debut album, Interplanetary Escape Vehicle, released in 1998, had a stronger live performance feel compared to the current STS9, with a mix of post-rock-like guitar expanses, Afrobeat-like rhythms, and jazz-like ensembles.

At the time, "livetronica" bands that mixed electronic music and improvisation, such as The Disco Biscuits and The New Deal, were beginning to emerge in the United States, and STS9 was positioned as part of this trend.

## 2-2. Resonance with festival culture

During this period, STS9 actively performed at local festivals.
**"Clubs/Fests/Live Bands Intersect Equally"**
We have established a unique position.

- long improvisations
- DJ-like loop feel
- Lighting and video production with a worldview

These were rare in the rock scene at the time, and were described by the audience as a ""DJ set that played.''

# 3. 2003–2008: Full-fledged approach to electronic music and golden age
## 3-1. *Artifact* (2005) - STS9's iconic work

2005"s "Artifact" is considered to be STS9"s masterpiece.

The multi-layered structure of synth layers, programmed beats, and thick percussion completely moved them away from the jam band framework and into a more electronic musical direction.

Representative song:
- "Atlas"
- "Something"
- "Arigato"
- "Tokyo"
-"Peoples"

These are frequently played in the current setlist and best symbolize STS9's musical image.

"Artifact" is a work that showcases STS9's sound and creativity to the fullest, and has earned high praise in the electronic music and jam band scene for its unique sound and innovative approach.

Their sound combines elements from a variety of genres, including ambient, electronica, jazz, funk, and dubstep.

A2"s "Tokyo" is known as STS9"s signature song and is often played in live performances.

"Artifact" is an important album in STS9's career, and is a must-have for fans of the band.

## 3-2. Evolution of live arrangement

The live structure of the same period was
- breakbeats
- Downtempo
- IDM-like pattern
- long improvisations
The audience transitioned to a floor/festival-type experience with the premise of ""dancing.''

What's important here is that STS9 pursued a technique for reproducing the "texture of electronic music" with guitar and bass.
Many parts passed through the effects chain, creating a characteristic in which the editorial thinking in the DAW was directly reflected in the live performance.

# 4. 2009–2014: Deepening of independent labels, social activities, and set structure
## 4-1. Management of independent label 1320 Records

STS9 launched their own label **1320 Records**,

This change also had an impact on the music, with clearer and more minimalist structures becoming more common.

## 5-2. *The Universe Inside* (2016)

# 6. Musical features of STS9
## 6-1. Rhythm structure: percussion-driven groove

The biggest feature of STS9 is its ensemble structure, with drums and percussion at the center.
In electronic music, live music plays the role of a drum machine, with bass, guitar, synths, and samples layered on top.

- Afrobeat
- breakbeats
- Latin percussion
- IDM subdivision
are combined, and the method of ""creating a world view with rhythm'' is thoroughly implemented.

## 6-2. Extensive use of sound processing and effects

In order to reproduce the feel of electronica with live performance,
- delay
- Looper
- filter
- Granular processing
Each instrument actively uses these.

This ensures **acoustic thickness** even during live performances, creating a three-dimensional feel similar to that of a DJ set.

STS9 changes their set list every time they tour,

- Deep downtempo part
- encore
and designs live performances with a structure that is similar to a DJ set.

## 7-2. Lighting/Video: Integration of sound and light

Lighting is extremely important at STS9 live performances.
A particular feature is that the movement of light is linked to changes in the song.
During the festival"s night performance, the lighting itself functions as a gigantic "stage set," heightening the audience"s sense of immersion.
