## Prologue: The guitar, a "body recording device"


Text: mmr｜Theme: Explaining the world"s and Japan"s leading guitarists from the perspective of era, genre, technique, and philosophy

The guitar is more than just a musical instrument; in the history of music since the 20th century, it has functioned as an extension of the body that directly conveys emotions and ideas. The moment your fingers touch the strings, the sound is generated from the vibrations of your fingers and reaches the world through amplifiers and effectors. The tone produced by a guitar acts like a mirror, reflecting a person's emotions, mental state, and even cultural background.

The image of a guitarist is different between Japan and the world. In the United States and the United Kingdom, blues and rock have become the foundation, and the genre has evolved into a mainstream one. However, Japan has experienced a more complex and free-flowing development, from the postwar electric boom to underground noise, improvisation, and post-rock. The uniqueness of Japanese guitars emerges at the intersection of mainstream technique and underground destructive expression.

# II. World Edition: The moment when the guitar started a revolution

## 1. Rock flashpoint (1950s-60s)

**Chuck Berry** built the backbone of rock"n"roll through the fusion of rhythm guitar and phrases. The cutting with his right hand forms the basis of a dance beat, while the phrases with his left hand draw a unique melody even though they are derived from blues. Berry's music showed that the electric guitar could become a symbol of youthful rebellion and freedom.
