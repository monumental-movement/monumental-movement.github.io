## Interaction with post-rock/ambient film and architecture

Text: mmr｜Theme: Post Rock/Ambient and movies/architecture

The evolution of post-rock/ambient is not limited to just a musical genre, but has an affinity with spatial art such as **film, architecture, and urban planning**.
In addition to historical masterpieces, we will also organize interactions with movies and architecture, as well as ambient experiences in urban spaces.

### Interaction with movies

Ambient/post-rock has had a great influence on film music, and has become established as a method of manipulating the audience's sense of time and spatial experience.

| Movies | Music | Year | Features |
|------|----------|----|------|
| *Arrival* | Jóhann Jóhannsson | 2016 | Expressing the sense of circulation of time with a drone sound |
| *Blade Runner 2049* | Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch | 2017 | Ambient depiction of the coldness and expanse of a futuristic city |
| *The Revenant* | Ryuichi Sakamoto & Alva Noto | 2015 | Expressing the pressure of nature and time with electronic and environmental sounds |
| *Solaris* (2002 edition) | Eduard Artemyev | 2002 | Expanding psychological space with cosmic ambient |
| *There Will Be Blood* | Jonny Greenwood | 2007 | Post-classical + noise creates tension and loneliness |

**point**
- Post-rock technique: Extend psychological time with a loop structure that repeats guitar and piano
- Ambient method: Expand the sense of space with sustained sounds and drones

### Connection with architecture and urban planning

Ambient/post-rock shows a strong presence in dialogue with urban spaces and architecture.

| Location/Project | Music/Sound | Year | Features |
|-------------------|------------|----|------|
| The Blur Building | Brian Eno (Sound Design) | 2002 | Merging water mist architecture and soundscape |
| Fondation Louis Vuitton | Brian Eno (Exhibition Sound) | 2014 | Ambient sound that matches the flow of the exhibition space |
| High Line Park, NYC | Various ambient compositions | 2009 | Walking experience with continuous sounds in urban space |
| Tate Modern Turbine Hall | Various sound installations | 2000s | Drone sound and audience experience expansion in a huge space |
| Oculus, NYC | Sound installation by Steve Reich / La Monte Young influence | 2016 | Integrating architectural reverb and urban acoustic design |

**point**
- The themes of the urban space are "extension of time" and "fusion with environmental sounds"
- In architecture, it is possible to design by calculating the volume, reflection, and movement of sound.
- Music functions as an experience of the entire space, rather than just listening to it alone.

### Summary

Post-rock/ambient is not just a music genre, but has evolved as a method of designing time and space.

Psychological expansion in film: time manipulation with drones, loops, and soundscapes

Applications in architecture and urban planning: the experience of staying in a space, walking lines, and harmony with urban environmental sounds

In the future, the fusion of VR/AR and AI-generated music will further evolve the immersive spatial music experience.
