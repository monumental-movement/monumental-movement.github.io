## What is SRL?

Text: mmr｜Theme: About an innovative group that questions the relationship between machines and humans, technology and art, and order and chaos.


Survival Research Laboratories (SRL) is an American performance art collective founded in San Francisco in 1978 by Mark Pauline. SRL is known for large-scale performances using machines and robots, aiming to repurpose industrial, scientific, and military technology into artistic and sociopolitical satire. Their work is associated with the art of Dada and Jean Tinguely, and has been praised for questioning the state and direction of technological society.

### Main activities and performances

SRL performances consist of ritualized interactions with machines, robots, and special effects equipment, with only the audience and operators participating as humans. Typical performances include:

- **Machine Sex (1979)**: SRL's first performance, which involved using The Demanufacturing Machine to smash objects and throw them at the audience.

- **Illusions of Shameless Abundance (1989)**: Set in San Francisco's SOMA district, a flaming piano, rotting food, fire-breathing robots and fake sculptures resembling explosives lead to beach closures and the dispatch of bomb squads.

- **The Unexpected Destruction of Elaborately Engineered Artifacts (1997)**: Takes place in Austin, Texas and features robots, flamethrowers, and V-1 jet engines.

### SRL activity history and transfer

#### Founding and early activities (1978-1980s)

Survival Research Laboratories (SRL) was founded in San Francisco in 1978 by Mark Pauline. SRL is known for its artistic reinterpretation of industrial, military, and science and technology, and its performances using machines and robots. Early performances included ""Machine Sex" (1979) and ""Illusions of Shameless Abundance" (1989), which made a strong impression on audiences.

#### Relocation and new base (2007-present)

In 2007, SRL moved to Petaluma, about an hour north of San Francisco. This move was made with 180 tons of equipment being moved due to rising rents for the San Francisco warehouse. Today, SRL is located at 839 N. Petaluma Blvd in Petaluma, where they build machines and prepare for performances in a large garage.

#### Current activities and prospects

SRL continues to perform using machines and robots, and in recent years has participated in events such as Burning Man. We are also pursuing the fusion of technology and art, such as developing machines that can be controlled remotely via the Internet.
