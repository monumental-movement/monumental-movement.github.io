<p>Text: mmr｜Theme: Tracing Toots and the Maytals’ live performances, including audience reaction, improvisation, and historical and cultural background.</p>

<p>Kingston, Jamaica in the 1960s. With the hustle and bustle of a port town, the buzz of markets, and the rhythms of street ska all over the city, Toots and the Maytals, led by Toots Hibbert, have become a presence that transforms music itself into culture through live performances.
At live performances, the audience is not just an audience member, but a part of the performance. Call-and-response, impromptu talks, and dance exchanges with the audience transform simple musical events into cultural rituals. ““Do the Reggay’’, which was born in 1966, was a symbolic moment, and the audience themselves became the promoters of reggae culture.

<h3 id="11-formation-and-first-stage">1.1 Formation and first stage</h3>
<p>In 1962, Toots Hibbert formed the Maytals with Freddie McGregor and Raleigh Gordon. They held their first stage at a small club in Kingston called Chocomo Lounge. Despite having a simple setup with just one microphone, guitar, bass, and drums, Toots’ voice dominated the entire floor.
The audience participates by clapping and dancing, and laughter echoes through the impromptu talks between songs. During the performance of “54-46 Was My Number,” people on the floor held hands and danced in a circle. When Toots calls out, “Step to the right! Step to the left!”, the audience responds immediately, and the performance becomes one with the audience.
<strong>Setlist example (initial live)</strong></p>

    <p>First performed in 1966, ““Do the Reggay’’ instantly electrified audiences at club shows in Jamaica. The audience sings, dances, and laughs in a circle on the floor, filling the venue. Every time Toots calls out, “Do the Reggay!”, a chain reaction of clapping and cheers ensues.
This song was not just a performance, but a cultural ritual with audience participation. The word reggae spread around the world, creating a moment when audiences functioned as transmitters of culture.

        <p>In 1970, Toots and the Maytals embarked on their first European tour. At London’s Carnival Club, young British people unfamiliar with Jamaican music mingled with the audience, and the boundaries between stage and floor disappeared.
