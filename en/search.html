Traditionally, hardware synthesizers, dedicated equipment, and recording studios were the main focus, limiting the environment in which individuals could freely produce and present songs. However, advances in PC (Windows) and software technology have ushered in an era in which people can freely create sounds at home. Meanwhile, “Jeskola Buzz” by Finnish developer Oskari Tammelin appeared around 1997 (or is said to have had an alpha version before then). Buzz is a freeware (free distribution) modular tracker/sequencer for Windows that has been supported by many users. The biggest attraction was the environment in which ““sound sources (generators), effects (machines), and routing (wiring) could be freely assembled to recreate ““modular equipment” on software.” This ““modular + tracker” configuration, unlike the GUI-centered DAWs (digital audio workstations) of the time, allowed for ““experimentalism” and a ““patch-like” approach, giving rise to a high degree of freedom in..."

    "body": "1. Introduction: Why City Pop now? Text: mmr Theme: 1980s Japanese urban pop “city pop” has been rediscovered by the YouTube generation and overseas DJs. The nightscape of the city and the sounds that reflect nostalgia are now a cultural phenomenon that resonates around the world. At the end of the 1980s, the term ““city pop’’ seemed to have ceased to exist in the Japanese music world. However, in the 2020s, this genre is making waves on streaming charts around the world. “Plastic Love” has been played tens of millions of times on YouTube, and playlists such as “Tokyo Night Drive” and “Japanese City Pop” consistently remain at the top of Spotify. This phenomenon is not just nostalgia. Behind this rediscovery led by chance by an algorithm lies a universal desire for music that coexists with urban sophistication and nostalgia. For young listeners overseas, these sounds are a symbol of ““retro-future.’’ Neon lights, the pavement after the rain, the warmth of analog recordings - they see the romance of the future in the “foreign past” that cannot be found in their own country’s music. DJ Night Tempo said, “This music is nostalgia for the future.” In other words, rather than..."

Text: mmr｜Theme: Music Easel, which even in modern times is praised by many live artists as the “smallest orchestra that can be played alone” The Buchla Music Easel, which appeared in 1973, is a portable version of the famous analog modular Buchla 200 series. Designer Don Buchla called the instrument a “portable composition environment.” It was not just a small modular, but was conceived as a ““personal improvised device.’’ “Easel is a sonic canvas. You can’t save the lines the player draws at the moment.” — Don Buchla Chapter 1: Don Buchla and the “Anti-Moog” Philosophy In the early 1960s, two major trends in the development of electronic musical instruments arose in East and West America. Moog in the east and Buchla in the west. Buchla aimed to “generate” sound rather than “control” it. A touch plate was used instead of a keyboard, and the focus of performance was on rate of change and contingency rather than pitch. His philosophy was carried over into the later Music Easel. Easel is an instrument for humans to perform with electronic circuits, and what exists there is the attitude of a ““co-author” rather than a ““performer =..."

It was the moment when Cuban song, African ritual music, and Harlem jazz met. Sabu Martinez”s congas roared like flames, and Arsenio Rodríguez”s tres sounded like it defied theory. In this article, we will discuss the “structure of Afro-Cuban music” that the two men built from their respective sides. Delve into the three layers of culture, society, and music theory. Chapter 1: The birth of Afro-Cuban - From the black earth and the Caribbean Sea At the end of the 19th century, Cuba was coming to the end of its history as a Spanish colony. However, behind the hustle and bustle of the War of Independence, another revolution was underway - that of music. Yoruba and Congolese ritual rhythms intersect with Spanish melodies, creating songs such as “son,” “rumba,” and “abakua.” This created a multi-layered rhythmic structure. **Religious elements: ** Ritual rhythms such as Santería’s ““bata drum” and Congolese ““makuta” have..."

His sound certainly breathes the ““aesthetics of space’’ that the city of Kyoto has. The lingering sound of a temple bell, the dampness of a summer shower, the clear flow of Shirakawa in winter. Even though they were not directly sampled, Rei Harakami’s sound somehow conveys the very atmosphere of Kyoto. Chapter 1: The arrival of Rei Harakami - Turning the “silence of the city” into sound Rei Harakami is a Kyoto-born track maker who suddenly appeared in the late 1990s amid the rise of Shibuya-kei and IDM. He presented a ““private room” and ““introspective” electronic sound that was different from the glittering Tokyo atmosphere. His representative early work, ““Red Curb’’ (1999), is a work that harmonizes the roundness of analog synth with minimal rhythm.

While Nigeria”s Fela Kuti championed “political Afrobeat,” Mali”s Habib Koité started a revolution in a quieter way. ──With a single guitar, he recreated the sound of Mali’s traditional stringed instrument ““Kamalengoni” and created ““Mali music without borders” with the band Bamada.

When we first hear Nala Sinephro’s music, we are forced to let go of the concept of a “song.” His debut album Space 1.8, released by Warp Records in 2021, was a work that melted the boundaries between jazz and ambient, modular synthesis and improvisation as if it were breathing. Harp, tenor saxophone, modular synthesizer, and space itself. Nala’s music depicts the moment when the sound itself becomes a “spiritual environment.” It is an experience that feels like ““the universe breathing in silence,’’ and turns the listener’s body into a resonating body. Chapter 1: The birth of the London scene - Wind from the South When people talk about the resurgence of jazz in London, what always comes to mind is the geographical energy of South London.

Explore the scientific structure hidden in his music and its redefinition as ambient jazz Sam Shepherd, aka Floating Points, was a neuroscientist before he was a musician. The ““precise sound design” and ““organic improvisation” that characterize his work are the very thoughts he creates as he goes back and forth between the laboratory and the stage. Electronic sounds are not inorganic data, but can be seen as waveforms that fluctuate in the same way as brain reactions. For him, sound is both a “measurable natural phenomenon” and the “uncontrollable breath of life.” 2. Science of structure - Elaenia period (2015) His debut album ““Elaenia’’ is a turning point in the scientific reorganization of the context of ambient jazz. The sound consists of modular synthesizer waveforms, Rhodes overtones, and string reverberations layered together to create a frequency dialogue. This dialogue is more like ““resonance as a physical phenomenon’’ like wave interference than improvisation. “Silhouettes (I, II &amp; III)” is a 10 minute sonic experiment, Synth LFO (low frequency vibration) and drummer Leo Taylor’s rhythm Repeat synchronization and desynchronization as frequencies of different periods.

What was ringing there was Three Suns―― It was a symbol of American home music in the 1940s, consisting of an accordion, guitar, and electric organ. This was a time when the war was over and television was not yet widespread. The music that played in people’s living rooms was neither jazz nor classical music, but the sound that symbolized ““relaxation’’ itself. At the center of that sound was the accordion. Three Suns’ music quietly influenced generations to come, pioneering lounge, exotica, and space-age pop. Chapter 1: The Three Suns Phenomenon - Music for the Home Three Suns was formed in 1940 by Pennsylvania brothers Al Nevins (guitar), Morty Nevins (accordion), and their cousin Artie Dunn (organ). At first, they mainly performed in nightclubs and hotel lounges, but in 1944, ““Twilight Time’’ became a hit. It can be said that this one song gave birth to the concept of “home music” in postwar America. 🎵 “Heavenly shades of night are falling…” As symbolized by this phrase,..."

Sampling is a technology that most directly embodies ““quotation” and ““reconstruction” in the history of music. From the early days of hip-hop in the late ’70s to today’s electronica, a single drum break, bassline, or scream has been transformed into hundreds or thousands of songs. 1. The Winstons – “Amen, Brother” (1969) Commonly known as “Amen Break”. The six-second drum solo spawned countless genres, including hip-hop, jungle, drum and bass, and hardcore techno. Producers everywhere from N.W.A. and Public Enemy to Aphex Twin and The Prodigy carved out this break. Former drummer Gregory Coleman passed away without a reward, but the ““spirit of the groove’’ that dwells between the snare and the hi-hat continues to resonate. 2. Lyn Collins – “Think (About It)” (1972) Produced by James Brown. A woman”s powerful shout and “Woo! Yeah!” break symbolize the golden age of hip-hop.

At the end of the 1960s, Miles Davis’s music was no longer an extension of his live performances, but instead transformed into a “sound architecture” constructed through recording and editing. Behind the change is producer and editor Teo Macero. Masero was not just a “behind the scenes” person. In his hands, a huge number of session tapes were cut and pasted and reassembled, resulting in a group of works that can be called ““composition by editing’’. ““In a Silent Way” (1969) and ““Bitches Brew” (1970) are prime examples. There is a revolution in editing aesthetics that goes beyond the boundaries between ““performance” and ““composition”. Chapter 1: The birth of an editor named Teo Macero Teo Macero was born in 1925 in Glens Falls, New York. He began his career as a jazz saxophonist and later studied composition at Columbia University, where he became familiar with avant-garde contemporary music. Like Stockhausen and Varèse, Macero developed an early awareness of treating sound as a material. In the late..."

Text: mmr｜Theme: Using DEVO’s symbol “Energy Dome” as a clue, deciphering the theory of degeneration, technology, DIY thinking, and the transformation of pop culture In the late 1970s, American new wave band DEVO embodied a new era of pop art, not only with their music but also with their visual iconography. The symbol of this is the red plastic hat they wore on stage and in their music videos – Energy Dome. This strange, futuristic design was more than just a costume. According to DEVO, it is “a device for reusing the energy that humans wastefully emit.” It was also a device that embodied their philosophy of De-Evolution through humor and irony. Chapter 1: The idea of ​​De-Evolution The band name DEVO comes from “De-Evolution” – the paradoxical concept that “humanity is not evolving, but rather degenerating.” This idea was born in response to the turmoil in America from the late 1960s to the 1970s: the Vietnam War, environmental pollution, and the runaway consumer society. Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale from Akron, Ohio, developed ““doubts about the myth of evolution’’ while studying art and politics. They realized that religious progressivism and belief in..."

Here we explore the philosophical intersection of his work and forest bathing (Shinrin-yoku). Recondite――real name Lorenz Brunner. When many people hear his music for the first time, they feel a sense of ““loneliness” and ““tranquility.” However, deep down, there is a tension between nature and technology. For Brunner, who grew up in the Bavarian forests of southern Germany, sound is not a product of the city; It was an organic thing born out of fog and humidity, wind and shadow. In recent years, the term ““forest bathing’’ (Shinrin-yoku) has been attracting worldwide attention, even in Japan. It is not just healing, but the act of reconnecting human senses to the natural environment. This concept and Recondite’s sonic world are strangely intimate. His minimal tracks are like walking through a digital forest. Chapter 1: The phenomenon called Recondite Since their debut in 2011, Recondite has carved out a unique position in the progressive techno scene. While distancing himself from Berlin’s club culture, he combined solitude and nature motifs. Representative works: “On..."

In 1978, an unusual band appeared in the port city of Bristol in southwestern England. Its name is The Pop Group. Although they called themselves pop, their music was not funk, punk, or jazz, but rather an experiment in which all genres collided explosively. Their sound evokes the unemployment, class, political corruption, and alienation of young people that covered England in the 1970s. It was sublimated as a “scream” of the sound itself. It wasn’t just music, it was ““anti-establishment physical expression” and ““an art that brings together fragments of ideas.” The city of Bristol is a port city with a history of slave trade and a multicultural mix. The musical movement born here was also the birthplace of the trip-hop culture that would eventually lead to Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky.

He is not just a DJ, but has become known as an ““architect who reconstructs the speed of sound and space.’’ The disco scene at the time was dominated by 4/4 rhythm, which was represented by American soul and house music. However, Baldelli interweaves ethnic music, electronic sounds, progressive rock, African drums, and even krautrock.

From there, a group called “Xiaolin” emerged that shocked the history of hip-hop. Wu-Tang Clan - The chain of combative and philosophical words woven by nine MCs was a strange form of art that combined street violence with Buddhist tranquility. At the core of their worldview, kung fu movies, oriental philosophy, and ““anime imagination’‘ coexisted. For black American youth in the 1990s, Asian culture was an ““exotic spiritual weapon’’ and a means of escape from social oppression. Wu-Tang Clan sampled Bruce Lee, Sun Tzu, and Lao Tzu, and later resonated strongly with the aesthetics of Japanese anime. Chapter 1: Shaolin Thought and Anime Combat Aesthetics The word “Shaolin” appears repeatedly in Wu-Tang Clan’s early works. This is not just an Asian hobby. For them, “Shaolin” was a metaphor for inner training, training oneself in the midst of poverty and violence.

The person who has continued to stand at the center of this is Masami Akita (Merzbow). His sound is violent yet meditative, destructive yet organic. It goes beyond the framework of ““music” and should instead be seen as an ““aural philosophical experiment.” The name Merzbow comes from Schulz’s Dada-like collage work ““Merzbau’’. In other words, the very act of dismantling existing structures and reconstructing the fragments is his creative principle. Akita has been active for over 40 years, but his philosophy has always been ““the politics of listening’’. Noise is not just “noisy sound”, but a counterattack of sounds that have been excluded from the social order.

There are approximately 1,000 cases of crop damage per year, and human damage has approximately doubled in the past 10 years (Ministry of the Environment’s ““Wild Animal Damage Statistics 2024’’). The physical measures taken so far are not sufficient, and sustainable damage control methods are required.

Sanae Takaichi is often described as a ““conservative,” ““strong-minded,” and ““a fighting woman.” However, at its root lies the impact of the heavy metal music he heard in his youth. Metal is a music of passion and construction, an art that confines passion within order.

There were people who left their university’s electronic music studio and tried to take a device for designing sound back into their personal creative spaces. Their names are Don Buchla and Serge Tcherepnin. Buchla and Serge are often talked about as the so-called “progenitors of modular synths,” but they actually stand out in that they sought to create philosophical tools rather than commercial instruments. Their design philosophy contained an “anti-normative” sonic perspective that is common to today’s Eurorack, Max/MSP, and even AI-based generated music. 1. Don Buchler: Poetics of Electronic Sound 1-1. From San Francisco Tape Music Center At San Francisco’s Tape Music Center in the early 1960s, artists like Morton Subotnick and Pauline Oliveros were exploring new relationships between experimental music and technology. What they were looking for was ““an instrument that was not an extension of the piano or guitar.’’ The Buchla Series 100 (1963–1966) appeared in response to Subotnick’s request.

Richie Hawtin has been redefining “techno” since the early 1990s, not just as dance music, but as a “sound meditation device.” His works under the name Plastikman, particularly ““Sheet One” (1993) and ““Consumed” (1998), are experiments in visualizing the internal space of the human body with electronic sound, and the sound, which resembles cold liquid, is also called ““abstract sculpture of sound.’’ Chapter 1: Echoes of Detroit, Solitude of Windsor Richie Hawtin was born in Banbury, England in 1970 and moved to Windsor, Canada as a child. From this city across the Detroit River, he could see the early days of Detroit techno at the underground clubs Music Institute and The Shelter.

In the early 1990s, Richard D. James (Aphex Twin) emerged as someone who completely turned the existing grammar of genres like techno and ambient on its head. His early works are sound experiments in which mechanical dreams and human illusions intertwine, and his current sound lies between an artificial intelligence structure and a return to nostalgia.

The silence is often broken by a single note on the piano or a haunting singing voice. This act is both intuitive and deeply scientific. Music is a ““resonator’’ of emotions and the only experience that can be shared in solitude. In this paper, while crossing the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and cultural history, We will explore the question, “Why do people listen to music when they are sad?” Chapter 1: Sadness and the Brain - Neural Resonance Structure According to modern neuroscience, sadness is strongly associated with activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the brain. By listening to music, these areas undergo “emotional restructuring” and Encourages the process of objectively viewing one’s own emotions. Music is not just an external stimulus, but a ““mirror of nerves.’’ When you listen to a sad melody, “sad neurons” resonate in your brain, The feel-good chemical dopamine is secreted there. This contradictory reaction—”pleasure in sadness”—is what This is one of the biggest reasons why people seek out sad music...."

Explore why people are attracted to destructive artists from the perspectives of psychology, cultural history, and brain science. Why are we so captivated by the image of an artist heading toward destruction? Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, Amy Winehouse, and Yukio Mishima. Their lives came to an untimely end, with their works shining like crystals of pain, conflict, and loneliness. When we come into contact with their music and literature, we are exposed to a ““human cry” that goes beyond mere ““works.” It is also a modern myth that represents the anxiety, emptiness, and desire for recognition that everyone has. Chapter 1: Genealogy of destructive artists A destructive artist is one who turns the urge for self-destruction into a driving force for creation. Their history began with the birth of modern art. In 19th century Romanticism, poets and painters considered “madness” to be a symbol of creativity. It extolled the nobility of the soul that cannot fit into society. Byron, Rimbaud, Van Gogh.

Tracing the history and present of the multi-layered sounds produced in Tokyo. The city of Tokyo has continued to change its contours through sound. The sounds of trains, crowds, the hum of neon signs, street guitars, and underground beats. Each sound coexists, composing different eras and different layers. In this column, we will focus on four areas in Tokyo where musical cultures have intersected in particular: Shinjuku, Shibuya, Shimokitazawa, and Akihabara, and trace the changes in sound from the postwar period to the present day. It is not just a piece of local history, but a record of the city’s “soundscape,” a mirror image of society mediated by music. Chapter 1: Shinjuku - Jazz City of Chaos and Freedom 1. Shinjuku Pit In and Postwar Jazz Night In the late 1960s, young people emerging from the post-war chaos gathered in the back alleys of Shinjuku.

Considering the reconstruction of the relationship between humans and the world as told by music without sound When John Cage”s ““4”33’’ premiered in New York in 1952, audiences were perplexed and agitated. The pianist doesn’t play a single note. However, the venue was filled with sounds: coughs, chairs creaking, and the wind outside. At that moment, it became clear that music is not just composed sounds, but the act of listening itself. Cage speaks. “There is no silence. Everything is sound.” This philosophy greatly expanded the realm of music and was passed on to 21st century sound art, field recording, and ambient music. Chapter 1: What is listening to sound? — Listening as sensory retraining We do too much “unconscious listening” in our daily lives. Smartphone notification sounds, subway announcements, street noises. They recede into the background of consciousness and become just a piece of information. However, Cage and the composers of musique concrète encouraged us to practice rediscovering listening. Listening is an act of renewing one’s relationship with the..."

The city is both a place for work during the day and a device for regaining freedom at night. Club culture is just another face of modern society created by this ““night city.’’ After the Industrial Revolution, when the boundaries between work and leisure, day and night, and order and deviation were clearly delineated, people escaped into the night streets and created new communities through music and their bodies. Chapter 1: The rhythmic device of the city — industrialization and the liberation of the night Industrial cities at the end of the 19th century realized a ““24-hour society’’ with night lighting. When the lights come on, the city at night transforms into a place not only for work but also for entertainment and desire. What emerged was a space that became the prototype for dance halls, cabaret, and disco.

The magic of music production, once confined to the walls of a studio, has finally descended into everyone’s rooms thanks to laptops and inexpensive audio interfaces, DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations). A bedroom producer is not just someone who creates sound alone. They are the embodiment of the ““democratization” of the music industry, and at the same time they are also a symbol of the ““creativity of solitude.” Nowadays, with direct access to the world via Spotify and SoundCloud, the bedroom is no longer a “private space.” Through its network, it has become the base of a new music city = digital city.

However, amidst all this perfect convenience, a strange backlash is occurring. –It’s the revival of records.

An anthropological study of sound as an archive of melody, time, and emotion At one moment, a melody plays on the radio, instantly bringing back the scenery that he had forgotten for years. This is the power of sound memory, similar to smell. Neuroscience has also shown that music directly stimulates the hippocampus (memory) and amygdala (emotions). But more than that, music is an ““art of time” and a ““reenactment of the past.” Listening to music is not just entertainment, but a physical act of replaying the past. It existed even before recording technology was invented; it was a way for humans to “share memories” through voice and rhythm. Chapter 1: Memory and Rhythm — Music as a “structure of time” The most fundamental structure of music is rhythm. Rhythm is the order of time, and through repetition it brings the past back into the present. Festivals, prayers, and dances. All of these are acts of experiencing the circle of time. Carving out a rhythm is the very act of consolidating memory. In ancient oral culture, poems and myths were passed down in rhythm. This..."

This is a feeling that goes before ““listening” and is a completely different perceptual circuit from ““understanding” music. Anthropologist Andre Leroy-Gourand He defined human culture as the “extension of the body.” Just like stone tools and writing, rhythm is also an extension of the human body. In other words, dancing is the first technology of civilization. Chapter 1: Drums and Ritual - The Origin of Rhythm 1.

    "body": "Chapter 1: Electronic music and Japan — Susumu Yokota’s position Text: mmr｜Theme: Susumu Yokota. A solitary artist who explores the soul of sound at the border between club culture and ambient. Tracing its tranquility and cosmic nature In the early 1990s, Japan’s electronic music scene was still in its infancy. While techno and house were becoming popular as imported culture, ambient music, which focused on “environmental sounds” and “silence,” was still a minority experimental genre. Susumu Yokota was a poet who lived in this quiet space. His music is an extension of club culture, yet somehow ““outside’’ it. He was a rare artist who used electronic particles to depict the breath of nature, the distance of the wind, and the reverberations of memories. Although Yokota started out in Tokyo’s club scene, he quickly transcended that context. His music focused more on “pause” than the “rhythm” of dance music, and moved toward pursuing the tranquility and organicity of electronic music. This is similar to the Japanese sense of ““wabi-sabi’’. Chapter 2: Susumu Yokota as a writer — Poetry of soundscape Yokota’s early works are heavily influenced by acid house. Acid Mt. Fuji (1994) was a groundbreaking work that fused natural sounds..."

The moment your fingers touch the strings, the sound is generated from the vibrations of your fingers and reaches the world through amplifiers and effectors. The tone produced by a guitar acts like a mirror, reflecting a person’s emotions, mental state, and even cultural background. The image of a guitarist is different between Japan and the world. In the United States and the United Kingdom, blues and rock have become the foundation, and the genre has evolved into a mainstream one. However, Japan has experienced a more complex and free-flowing development, from the postwar electric boom to underground noise, improvisation, and post-rock. The uniqueness of Japanese guitars emerges at the intersection of mainstream technique and underground destructive expression. II. World Edition: The moment when the guitar started a revolution 1.

Even in the days when Buddy Rich and John Bonham dominated the main stage, another heartbeat was beating somewhere in a warehouse or small jazz bar. They were often too excessive, too free, and difficult to understand. However, a new rhythm was born from that “blank space”. Underground drummers were playing time rather than instruments. It was neither a nation nor a genre, but the language of a ““sensory community.’’ Introduction: What is rhythm?

Trance was formalizing and progressive house was becoming rigid. In it, James Holden was exploring sounds that move back and forth between melody and noise, analog and digital, intelligence and emotion. “Border Community” was born as his “border laboratory.” II. Landscape of 2001: Dawn of Post-Progressive In 2001, Holden gained attention with the song “A Break in the Clouds” released on Silver Planet.

Text: mmr｜Theme: A full-length cultural theory that traces the “future nostalgia” of synth pop, from YMO to Charli XCX Pop music seemed to take on a new lease of life when synthesizers became more than mechanical sounds and began to play with emotion. Synthpop, which was born in the late 1970s as technology evolved, continues to give us a cold yet beautiful feeling of “nostalgia for the future.” Chapter 1 The moment electronic music became “pop” In the 1970s, synthesizers from Moog, ARP, and Japanese manufacturers like Roland and Yamaha democratized music production. Electronic sound, which until then had been the preserve of gigantic studio equipment, gradually found its way into homes and live music venues. Kraftwerk’s “The Robots” is inorganic, as if questioning the boundaries between humans and machines, yet resonates with a strange sense of humor. The vision they presented of ““man = machine’’ became the concept that underpinned all subsequent pop music. Gary Numan, Human League, and Depeche Mode carried on that spirit. They replaced rock’s passion with synths and turned cold urban melancholy into beats. This was a time when the word “future” still contained both hope and fear;..."

How has the phenomenon of EDM changed the shape of celebrations in the 21st century? A flash of laser light splits the night sky, the bass shakes deep within its body, and countless arms raise in unison. The phenomenon called “EDM” was more than just a music genre, it was a celebration of the digital age. In the 2010s, cities around the world were reshaped by the sound. The desert of Las Vegas, the forests of Belgium, the bay of Tokyo. In this column, we will take a look at EDM’s birth, transformation, and “beyond” from the intersection of sound, light, the body, and technology. Ⅰ. EDM as a building of light and sound It was not an extension of the club, but a redesign of the city itself. Hundreds of thousands of people jump at the same time. The stage is like the gate of a futuristic city. EDM was the ““festival architecture’’ of the 21st century. Originally, the word EDM was more of a marketing term than a genre name. However, that ambiguity was a symbol of the..."

In the early 1980s, Chicago’s club scene was experiencing a lull due to the decline of disco. As disco grew commercially and disappeared from radio and the mainstream, young people were looking for a new outlet for musical expression. One of the answers was the music that later became known as ““Chicago House.’’ The Warehouse club was a musical testing ground during this period. In a vast warehouse-like space, members of the black community, LGBTQ+ community, and urban youth gathered to immerse themselves in music. This place was not just a place for entertainment, but also a place for self-expression and a sense of community.

For Frost, who is originally from Australia and lives in Iceland, sound is a physical phenomenon and a form of violence. It is constructed as an architectural and tactile experience that goes beyond melody and rhythm. “Sound is a sculpture of air, a pressure acting on the body,” he says.

If we look at the history of records, we can see how this “intermediate format” marked a turning point in the times. 10 inches is not just a matter of size. It was also another philosophy that redefined ““length of time” and ““density of sound.” The restriction of around 10 minutes per side forced artists and engineers to choose ““condensation,’’ and the result was a surprisingly well-defined sound and a listening experience that required concentration. “Just long enough to take a drink by the time you finish listening.” The aesthetics of 10 inches resides in this sense of time. 10-inch as a history of technology: Balance of rotation speed, groove width, and sound quality The appeal of the 10-inch cannot be explained simply by being “in between the sizes.” It is built on an exquisite..."

The physical structure of a record embodies the philosophy of the musical format in its purest form. The 10-inch disc is a format that is particularly ““designally middle-of-the-road.’’ A board with a diameter of 25 cm exhibits intermediate characteristics between 7 inches and 12 inches in terms of linear groove speed, groove width, and rotational speed.

In the 2010s, horror movies have transformed into an art form that is more conscious of sound than ever before. Jump scares are a thing of the past, and instead low frequencies, environmental noise, and reverberations dominate the scares. This was also an application of the psychoacoustic discovery that hearing affects the deeper psyche more directly than vision. Horror movies of this era not only gave fear, but also ““eroded”’ the audience”s inner world through sound. At the center of this change were a new generation of production studios such as A24 and Blumhouse. Chapter 1: A24’s “terrifying new sound” The arrival of A24 elevated horror into the context of art cinema. “The Witch” (2015) is a symbol of this. The score by Mark Korven rejects melody, with a prayerful drone composed of wooden instruments and microtones that grips the audience’s nerves. Acoustic design that blurs the line between silence and noise was at the heart of the A24 aesthetic. In the following..."

While speech was increasingly controlled under the military regime, young people were inspired by British and American rock and sought new sonic freedom. At the forefront of this movement was the Tropicália movement. Along with the poet Torcato Neto and the artist Hélio Oiticica, the musical leaders were Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. With the goal of “redefining Brazilian music,” they freely fused bossa nova, samba, folklore, and rock. “Tropicália is the tropics in our souls.” — Caetano Veloso, 1968 In the studios of the time, ““manual overdubbing” was repeated, taking advantage of the limitations of recording equipment. ““Psychedelic sound technology” was born, including physically cutting and pasting reel-type tape and rotating the tape backwards to create reverse echoes.

Life and musical evolution Fela Aníkúlápó Kútì was born in Abeokuta in 1938 and received his musical education in London before returning to Nigeria in the late 1960s and creating his own musical language, combining blues/jazz/funk/highlife with traditional rhythms. It became more political during the Koola Lobitos period in the 1960s and Africa ‘70 in the 1970s, and later developed into formations such as Egypt 80.

However, if you look at fashion shows in recent years, you will find that the two have built a surprisingly close relationship. Intimacy between fashion show and noise Since the 1990s, high-end brand shows have actively introduced not only rock and classical music, but also noise/industrial music. Balenciaga made industrial noise roar in a ruin-like space, presenting clothing and space as ““aggressive beauty.’’ Rei Kawakubo of COMME des GARÇONS has been drawn to experimental music since the 1980s, and has layered repetition and dissonance into fashion. Yohji Yamamoto alternated between tranquil classical music and roaring noise in his show, acoustically visualizing the “white space” and “excess” of clothing.

However, in the 21st century, with the advent of YouTube, SNS, and archive sites, ““cultures that were supposed to be unrecorded’’ are beginning to be recorded and reevaluated. This change is extremely interesting from both media and music culture perspectives. Rave, a space without media ● The essence of rave is “anti-media” Rave culture in the 1990s (particularly underground raves in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan) avoided media exposure and documentation. Legal risks (illegal parties and drug problems) Rebellion against commercialism (not “music that sells”) The “physical experience” at that moment is everything (realized from records) In other words, the rave was “live” in every sense of the word.

Origin (1988-1994) Background of the times In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chicago/New York club culture began to diverge and diversify from its disco-based house roots.

Points of interest/site In clubs in New York and Chicago in the early 1990s, DJ sets themselves were central to genre expression. In the early days, live editing using records and turntables was the mainstream. Representative tools (at the time) Turntable: Technics SL-1200 series (standard in the field).

Born from a combination of artistic, technological, and social backgrounds, it has continued to change shape for over 100 years. 1) Pioneer (1910s–1940s): Futurism and tape experiments — conceptualization of “noise” Historical background A time when industrialization and urbanization made the noise of the city crowds and machinery commonplace.

Detroit techno is ““electronic music with a human touch’’ that was born from the intersection of urban industrial sounds, black American dance culture, and European electronic music. In this column, we will comprehensively introduce the history of its origin, the characteristics of its sound, its main characters and representative songs, its social background, its spread around the world, and its influence to this day. Origins and Definition — When and Who Called it “Techno”? In Detroit in the early 1980s, electronic dance music that made full use of synths and rhythm machines grew. Led by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (not the so-called “Berlin trio” but the “Detroit trio”), they presented a sonic aesthetic that was different from the existing “electro” and “house,” and it became established as “techno.” The release of the 1988 compilation “Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit” (https://amzn.to/4q9NMVF) played a decisive role in the spread of the genre name.

As the name suggests, this genre is a combination of “Happy” and “Hardcore”.

    "body": "New Wave is not just a genre, but a ““sensibility of the times’’ that inherits the experimental spirit of the post-punk era and fuses diverse music and cultures.** Text: mmr｜Theme: Post-punk era art movement From post-punk to new wave The punk movement of 1976 shook up the music scene with its directness of being ““simple, fast, and anti-establishment.” However, its explosive power was short-lived, and as punk became increasingly commercialized, many artists sought musical expansion while maintaining the ““punk spirit.” The general term that was born from this experiment was ““New Wave.’’ From an academic perspective, new wave is a concept that encompasses a variety of musical developments since post-punk, and rather than a strict genre name, it is a cultural label that refers to the consciousness and sensibilities of the times. Musical features and innovations The musical characteristics of new wave can be organized into the following elements: Rise of the synthesizer With the spread of analog synths and drum machines, mechanical and futuristic sounds were created. Gary Numan and Ultravox are prime examples. Cross-genre They freely incorporated funk rhythms (Talking Heads), reggae grooves (The Police), and disco dance feel (Blondie), transcending genre boundaries. Coexistence of pop and experiment..."

The sound was characterized by fast tempos (120-140 BPM), synth-based riffs, and dramatic female vocals, and had a more cathartic and energetic feel than traditional disco. Hi-NRG had a particularly strong following in gay clubs. After the Stonewall Riots in the 1970s, the LGBTQ community sought a place for their expression and identity in the club scene, and Hi-NRG functioned as their “music of liberation.” Role of Hi-NRG in LGBTQ 🌈 symbol of freedom At a time when homosexuality was still subject to discrimination and prejudice, Hi-NRG provided “a space where people could dance and love each other without being tied down by anyone.” Club dance floors were safe spaces where people could escape from the oppression of society, and Hi-NRG was essential as background music. 🌈 Expression of identity Hi-NRG’s lyrics often have themes of love, desire, and self-liberation, and they resonate not..."

The origin of the name goes back to the label ““Acid Jazz Records’’ founded by DJ [Gilles Peterson] (https://amzn.to/3KOnzMr) and record producer [Eddie Piller] (https://amzn.to/4hdwdAb). In the club scene of the 1980s, there was a growing movement to reevaluate black music in response to the enthusiasm for acid house and hip-hop. Acid jazz emerged as ““danceable jazz” and ““soulful music suitable for clubs.” Musical features Acid jazz tends to refer to a ““hybrid feeling’’ rather than a single genre. Characteristic elements include: Groove emphasis: Inheriting the rhythmic feel of 70’s funk and rare grooves Improvisation: Introducing solos and interplays derived from jazz Club-oriented: Remix-like development with DJ play and dance floor in mind Sampling Culture: Incorporating a hip-hop approach and reconstructing past jazz-funk sound sources Urban sophistication: Has a stylish mood with a mix of Latin and soul.

    "body": "What is Electronic Body Music? Text: mmr｜Theme: What is electronic body music? Origin: Industrial reverberations and mechanical rhythms EBM is a genre of electronic music that originated in Europe (mainly Belgium and Germany) in the early 1980s. The name comes from the fact that the music is composed of a physical dance groove and electronics. This can be described as a fusion of industrial music and electronic dance music. In particular, the following two groups are known as pioneers: Front 242 (Belgium) DAF (Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, Germany) By making full use of cold, sharp electronics, violent minimal beats, and militaristic vocals, they created a new kind of “physical electronic music” that differs from conventional pop and rock. Sound characteristics To put it simply, EBM’s sound is “inorganic and physical.” It features the following elements: Hard and minimal beat Mainly 4/4 time signature, BPM around 120-140 Mechanical rhythm like industrial machinery Heavy use of drum machines (Roland TR-808, TR-909, etc.) Synthesizers and Sequencers Monochrome, dark, heavy synth sound Loop configuration driven by analog/digital sequencer Balancing the trance state and physicality created by repetition Vocal Low, inorganic voices, mostly male voices Speaks in a commanding tone, slogan-like rather than singing.

The origin of this genre was born from the “accidental misuse” of an electronic instrument called the Roland TB-303 Bass Line Synthesizer. Originally developed as a bass guitar replacement, the TB-303 was used by DJs and producers (particularly from a unit called Phuture) in unexpected ways, producing undulating, ““liquid” and ““psychedelic” basslines. Phuture’s 1987 single “Acid Tracks” became the prototype for this new style, both in sonic character and name. Sound characteristics: Chemical sound image brought about by TB-303 The most important characteristics of acid house are the following sound elements: Baseline with TB-303 Unique “purpy” and “squish” sound Mysterious acoustic changes caused by filter resonance and slide Analog randomness and manual operation organicity Quadruple kick BPM is a stable tempo of around 120-130 Standard combination with drum pattern by TR-808 or TR-909 Minimal structure Trip feeling due to repeated loops Create a sense of ecstasy with long build-ups and detailed changes This sound had..."

Generally, the BPM (tempo) is around 60 to 110, and it is characterized by relaxing rhythms and sounds aimed at listening and chilling out, rather than intense beats for clubs. In between the throbbing heartbeat and the hustle and bustle, a sudden silence appears. If it”s music, downtempo is that moment of deep breathing. In the world of club culture and electronic music, it is a music genre that is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the fast beats of techno and house, but it is close to the listener”s emotions and blends into the city night. That’s downtempo. Downtempo is created through the intersection of multiple genres, including the floating feel of ambient, the grooves of hip-hop, and the organic elements of jazz and soul. Although it often overlaps with styles such as chillout, trip hop, and lounge music, it is also used as a general term for a gentle groove that encompasses these styles. 90’s Chill Out Revolution From the late 1980s to..."

Why did Eurobeat, which was born in Europe and evolved in its own way in Asia, become deeply connected to the Parapara style in Japan?

What is Eurobeat? ─ Evolution of Italo Disco Eurobeat has its roots in “Italo Disco”, which was born in Italy in the 1980s. Adding elements of high energy (Hi-NRG), the tempo changes to a catchy, synth-driven sound. ● Main musical characteristics BPM: 140-160 and very fast Structure: Clear chorus, frequent use of refrains Rhythm: 4/4 drum + handclap Melody: Bright, dramatic, and melancholy This structure was a perfect match for the parapara dance, which repeats the same pattern.

Therefore, ““recorded film music media’’ did not exist in this era.

This genre is extremely philosophical music that stands on the border between music and art, sound and space, perception and consciousness. From the words of Brian Eno It was British musician Brian Eno who defined the term ambient as a musical genre. In 1978, he wrote the following in his masterpiece [Ambient 1: Music for Airports] (https://amzn.to/48shEpU): “Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.” ““Ambient music must not force itself to be heard, but at the same time allow itself to be ignored.’’ In other words, ambient music is not background music, but it functions like background music.

    "body": "Definition of punk and hardcore: the crossroads of anger and expression Text: mmr｜Theme: Punk/Hardcore In the late 1970s, young people felt oversaturated with commercialized rock music, and ““music that is simple, rough, and above all, expresses its true feelings”’ was born. It”s punk. However, even this punk style eventually began to turn inward, sometimes formally. It was hardcore punk that once again unleashed the flames of anger. In this column, we will delve into the definitions and differences between punk and hardcore from the perspectives of music, ideology, fashion, and history. What is punk? ▍Musical features Simple chord progression (mainly 3 chords) fast, rough rhythm Short song duration (about 1-3 minutes) Non-melodic, screaming vocals Representative bands: The Ramones (US), Sex Pistols (UK), The Clash (UK) ▍Thoughts and values Anti-system/anti-authority: Distrust of the state, police, companies, religion, etc. DIY spirit: Make your own music, make records, print flyers, and perform live. **Anti-fashion yet fashionable: **Safety pins, mohawks, leather jackets, etc. ▍Cultural background In Britain in the 1970s, a recession, soaring unemployment rates, and a sense of isolation among young people became social problems. Politically, it was the nascent stage of Thatcherism. Music functioned as that counterculture. What is hardcore? ▍Musical features..."

Britain not only embraced this music, but expanded it from the underground to clubs, raves and venues for sonic experimentation. In this article, we will cover the overall picture of 90s UK techno from the perspectives of culture, music, people, and labels. Fusion of rave culture and underground Following the ““Second Summer of Love”’ in 1988, the UK was engulfed in an explosion of acid house and rave. In the aftermath, various subspecies of hardcore, breakbeat, and techno grew underground in the early “90s. On the other hand, the end of the Thatcher government and widening economic disparity caused young people’s dissatisfaction and rebelliousness to be imprinted in music. UK techno was not just dance music, it was also a social movement armed with sound systems and illegal raves. Lineage of Innovators ● The Black Dog A pioneer of Intelligent Techno (IDM).

First of all, the core of “Smokers Delight” lies in its “relaxed groove.” The album opens with “Nights Introlude,” featuring soft strings and a gentle beat that samples Quincy Jones’ “Summer In The City,” instantly drawing the listener into a relaxing space. Musically, the hip-hop skeleton is woven with the essence of reggae, soul, and funk, giving it a unique eclecticism. For example, in “Groove St.,” a deep piano bass line intertwines with a smooth bassline, and the addition of light drums creates a simple yet addictive loop. Meanwhile, longer tracks like ““Pipes Honor,’’ which clock in at over nine minutes, gradually develop layers of guitar and keyboard, taking the listener on a meditative journey.

It was probably processed by the E-MU sampler”s Z-plane filter. This Reese sound was used on a variety of tracks, including “Nasty Ways,” “Take My Life,” “Love Is Not a Game Remix,” and “Bambaata Remix,” and variations of it were also used on “Tudor Rose” and “Go Dillinja.” It’s no exaggeration to say that this Reese sound is probably the coolest drum &amp; bass sound ever created.
