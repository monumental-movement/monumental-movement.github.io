This method of treating the voice itself as an instrument through melody, rhythm, timbre, and phrasing has been much more than just a singing technique in the history of jazz. It was an act that updated the very questions ““What is a singer?” and ““What role does the voice play?” In early 20th century America, jazz was a music that was supported by the body and memory rather than sheet music. Improvisation was not an ornament, but a practice at the heart of music. Scat is a natural outcome of this improvisational nature that extends to the voice. By temporarily abandoning words that convey meaning, singers were able to stand on the same level as performers. Developments in recording technology were also important. In the process of moving from wax cylinders to shellac discs, improvisation changed from a one-time event to something that is repeatedly listened to, analyzed,..."

    "body": "What is Quiet Storm? Text: mmr Theme: Tracing how Quiet Storm, born from late-night radio and studio space, changed the emotional design of R&amp;B In the mid-1970s, the way R&amp;B was listened to in urban America was quietly beginning to change. Separate from the funk and up-tempo soul that played on daytime radio, a group of songs selected for the night time slot began to spontaneously come together. Quiet Storm was the name given to the group later. Smokey Robinson’s 1975 album ““A Quiet Storm’’ is said to be a symbol of this. This work, produced in a studio in Los Angeles, was recorded with an emphasis on the distance and resonance of the vocals, suppressing the thick horns and strong backbeats. The microphone was placed close to his mouth, and it is said that he was conscious of making sure that his breathing and the fluctuation of his voice remained as they were. What is important here is that the silence was born not from the production, but from the recording environment itself. The album name was adopted as the title of a late-night show on an FM station in Washington, D.C., giving Quiet Storm a clear definition. In..."

    "body": "The eve of the birth of the jungle ─ Accumulation of breakbeat culture Text: mmr｜Theme: A multifaceted analysis of why jungle/drum and bass, which was born in the urban environment of London in the 1990s, is now being reevaluated, based solely on the facts of music technology, social background, and cultural influence. In Britain in the early 1990s, breakbeats derived from hip-hop, the bass culture of reggae/dub, and the faster dance music of rave were evolving in parallel. In London in particular, immigrant communities and youth club culture intersected closely, and musical intermingling was commonplace. Standard breaks such as the Amen break and Funky Drummer that had been used since the late 1980s began to be reconstructed in more detail with the spread of samplers and Akai MPCs. As a result, not just loops, but carved and rearranged rhythms became the main character. Jungle did not suddenly appear, but was established over many years of accumulating breakbeat culture. The name “jungle” and the formation of the initial scene The word “jungle” is said to come from slang used in reggae and dancehall, and was also called ragga jungle in its early days.

On the other hand, although the copyright system was developed to protect the rights of creators, it has always caused friction with cultural practices that are predicated on reuse, quotation, and modification. This paper takes the historical development of remix culture as a starting point, organizes the institutional characteristics of Japanese law, US law, and EU law, and examines the relationship between rights and creation from multiple angles, expanding the scope beyond music to include videos, memes, and derivative works. Even before the word remix became popular, human culture has always been premised on reuse and modification. Works such as parodies of folk songs, variations on oral literature, and melodic adaptations of religious music were not fixed, finished products, but transformed during the process of transmission. Even after the modern era, when the concept of musical notation and composers was established, variations, arrangements, and quotations have been regarded as legitimate creative acts. The themes and variations in classical music and the interpretation of standards in jazz show that the reconstruction..."

The structure, in which countless metal strings strung over a wooden resonance box are struck with thin mallets, does not separate melody and rhythm, but treats the particles of sound themselves as a flow of time. In Indian classical music, what is important is not ““where the melody goes” but ““how the notes rise and fall”. The santour can be said to be the instrument that most directly visualizes this idea. Santour is not an instrument that arranges sounds, but rather presents time as vibration. Origin and geographical background of Santoor The original form of the santur is thought to date back to percussion instruments distributed in ancient Persia and Central Asia. Similar instruments called santoor, santoor, and santoor have existed widely in Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Kashmir.

The history of Jamaican music becomes clearer when read as a change of generations rather than an evolution of genres. Roots reggae and dancehall were not competing values, but musical languages ​​chosen by young people who lived in different eras to respond to their own realities. Roots reggae, which came of age in the 1970s when post-independence ideals were still communal, placed social messages and spirituality at the heart of its music. As exemplified by Bob Marley and Burning Spear, songs transcended the individual and functioned as a collective voice. Since the 1980s, the dancehall generation, who grew up in an urban environment where economic instability and violence have become commonplace, values ​​immediate results over ideals and instantaneousness over permanence. Figures like Shabba Ranks exemplified the shift in music to a place where it was directly linked to survival. The two genres are mirrors of how different generations lived in the same society.

Text: mmr｜Theme: Since the 20th century, music has interacted with urban space, tracing the history of how music has reshaped the shape and feel of cities while crossing streets, clubs, homes, and media, using examples from specific cities and genres. Cities bring people together, divide them, and rearrange them. Population density, immigration, industry, transportation, regulation. When these elements overlap, music becomes not just entertainment, but the very rhythm of urban life. The sounds of a factory, the repetition of traffic, and the buzz of a crowd are structured through the musician’s sensibility and become a genre. Cities are not musical “stages”. It is a musical generator, and at the same time, it is an entity that is reinterpreted through music. The city is a mirror that reflects music, and at the same time has been reshaped by music.

    "body": "Prologue: When did sound become “action”? Text: mmr｜Theme: A long-form study that traces the history of how performance art and music have intersected and redefined the body, time, and space, based only on facts. Music has long been understood as a combination of the design act of composition and the reproduction act of performance. There, musical scores were central, and sound was merely the realization of visualized information. However, in the 20th century, this assumption began to rapidly shake. Urban noise due to industrialization, the spread of recording technology, and the expansion of popular culture have transformed sound from ““an object to be controlled” to ““something that exists in the environment.” At the same time, in the field of art, there is a growing movement to place more value on the production process and the act itself than on the completed object. Events that occur outside the painting or sculpture, the passage of time, and the audience’s reactions have come to be recognized as part of the work. Music was also not unrelated to this trend. In this chapter, we will organize the historical background that led to sound transcending the framework of music and being reconsidered as actions and..."

In the late 1980s, Chicago house and Detroit techno traveled to Europe, receiving their own interpretations in each city. In Germany, there is an emphasis on minimal and mechanical repetition, while in England, breakbeats and rave culture are combined. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, there was an unusual amount of interest in the ““hardness” and ““speed” of techno. At the time, Dutch DJs didn’t play imported American techno as it was, but instead raised the pitch and used equalizers to exaggerate the low frequencies to see how the floor would react. The BPM exceeds 140, the beat becomes more linear, and the music begins to be treated as a shock to the body. This change was driven more by the field than by studio production.

Text: mmr｜Theme: View rhythm programming as a design concept rather than a performance technique, and decipher the overall picture of modern beat aesthetics from the design of 16 steps, loops, and tone arrangement. Rhythm programming is not a matter of lining up the dots accurately. It is an act of design: how to divide time, where to emphasize, and where to leave blank space. If performance is a series of instantaneous decisions, programming is similar to thinking from a bird’s-eye view of time as a whole. With the advent of drum machines and sequencers, rhythm became separated from the body and became an object to be treated visually and numerically. This shift created a need to redefine the vague concept of groove at the expense of precision. Rhythm programming is the act of designing the very way we perceive time. Chapter 1: Mechanical time and 4/4/16 step design The basic unit of electronic rhythm design is 16 steps, which are divided into 16 4/4 time signatures. This equal division functions not as an aid to performance, but as a coordinate system for design. 4/4・16 steps basic layout example The most basic structure is to..."

    "body": "What is a virtual band? Text: mmr Theme: Deciphering from historical facts how virtual bands that combine digital technology and storytelling have changed the way music is made, heard, and believed. The invention of a “music unit” that has no substance A virtual band is a music project that does not feature any real people, but rather uses fictional characters or avatars as the main actors. What is important here is not that there are no people. Actual composers, performers, and producers do exist. However, what the audience is faced with is not the characters themselves, but the characters and worldview of the setting. This format is not just a visual presentation. It is characterized by the consistent functioning of a ““fictional subject’’ with a personality and story, including music production, live performances, media development, and the formation of fan communities. In other words, a virtual band is more like a structure for transporting music than a music genre. Virtual bands have been established as entities that fundamentally reconsider the premise of ““who is singing?’’ in music. Animation and concept bands as origins The premise of empathizing with fictional beings The origins of the virtual band can be found in..."

    "body": "Prologue: The expression form of girl band Text: mmr｜Theme: How women have updated music history in the form of bands In the history of rock and pop, girl bands have long been considered an anomaly. However, in reality, all-female bands have always been in conflict with the systems, technology, and social norms of the times, while building up their own unique expressions. Girls’ bands are not simply categorized by gender, but are a collection of practices surrounding production, performance, and self-determination. Even before the development of the music industry, women have performed in ensembles at home and in local communities. In the 20th century, with the establishment of the record industry and live house culture, the very presence of women in public as a band began to take on social meaning. This paper reconstructs these trends as world history. The history of girl bands is both musical history and social history. 1950–60s: The eve of rock and the emergence of women’s ensembles In the 1950s, rock and roll was born in the United States, and the band form became the center of youth culture. On the other hand, female musicians at the time were often in the forefront as singers,..."

    "body": "Music education as a social device Text: mmr｜Theme: How has music education changed society? -Cultural impact interpreted from the system, field, and history Music education is not just technical training. Like reading, writing, and arithmetic, it has been designed as a system for specifying what nations, religions, and communities should share. In schools, churches, the military, and local communities, music has always been linked to group formation, discipline, and the transmission of values. In the West, systematic music education was established in medieval monasteries. The unified transmission of Gregorian chant was the earliest example of the inseparability of musical notation and the educational system. Here, music was both a religious practice and an educational content that cultivated a class of knowledge. With the establishment of the modern nation, music education was incorporated into the public education system. Singing of the national anthem, singing education, and training of military bands were introduced as part of national unification through music. Before music education was ““sensitivity education,’’ it functioned as a device to stabilize the social structure. Music education has always been designed within social institutions, supporting both culture and governance. Formation of the public education system and music curriculum After the 19th..."

This question is both old and new. Melodies, rhythms, voices, and noises are physically nothing more than vibrations in the air, but we have found meaning in them, projected our emotions onto them, and sometimes entrusted our lives to them. When I listen to one song, I remember who I am, and when I listen to another song, I imagine who I want to be in the future. Throughout this cycle, music has gone beyond mere entertainment and has functioned as a framework for self-understanding. If we look back at history, we can see that music has always existed at the boundary between the individual and society. Religious rituals imprint community values ​​on the body, modern nations foster national consciousness, and in modern times, playlists make individuals’ inner lives visible. Music is given to us from the outside and continues to update our self-awareness while changing its meaning on the inside. Music is one of the oldest media we have used to understand ourselves.

    "body": "Prologue: The moment when words become sounds Text: mmr｜Theme: Tracing the history of the evolution of poetry and sound expression since the 20th century, which was born from the combination of voice and words with sound. Poetry reading and sound art are both often talked about as ““expressions received by the ears.’’ However, when one stands at the intersection of the two, what emerges is not just recitation or music, but a unique experience that involves time and space. The voice not only carries meaning, but also takes on texture, rhythm, and physicality, and the sound is freed from melody and harmony and expanded into the environment itself. In this liminal area, poetry has been transformed into an auditory art. Knowing the relationship between poetry reading and sound art leads to understanding how the boundaries between words and sounds have been shaken. The history of voice begins with poetry reading Poetry before letters Poetry was originally something that was ““spoken’’ before it was written. In ancient Greek epics, Japanese storytelling, and African oral poetry, poetry existed alongside voices, conveying communal memories with melodies and rhythms. Meaning and sound were inseparable, and the voice itself was the medium. Separation of modern..."

It was the result of translating the distortions and tensions of the social structure of the Argentine port city of Buenos Aires into sound. From the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, Buenos Aires was formed by a rapid influx of immigrants and became a multi-ethnic city unique in the world. Centered around Spain and Italy, Eastern European, African, and indigenous cultures were mixed together, and work, poverty, and loneliness existed on a daily basis. Tango grew up on the “underside” of this city. It was danced not at the balls of high society, but in the courtyards of dockworkers’ taverns, boarding houses, and brothels. Physical distance, line of sight, and improvisation were more important than musical sophistication. Tango is a culture that has always started from the periphery, not the center of society. Social background of the birth of tango Argentina in the late 19th century experienced rapid economic..."

    "body": "Outline of the musical culture of Nordic folk Text: mmr｜Theme: A long study that deciphers the dark side of the myths and folk beliefs engraved in Nordic folk music from history and folklore. The musical culture known as Nordic folk refers to the collective of folk songs, dances, and chants that have been handed down in regions such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. Even before these genres were given modern names, they have existed as music closely connected to life, faith, work, and death. The melodies are often based on a minor key, are repetitive, and have a musical time that contains tension and silence rather than ““brightness’’ in the modern sense. The lyrics often deal with themes such as the dead, ghosts, spirits, curses, and betrayal, as well as stories of heroism and love. This characteristic is not a coincidence, but is deeply connected to the very structure of the mythological system and folk beliefs in the Nordic world. Nordic folk was not entertainment music, but a device for preserving a mythical worldview as sound. The worldview underlying Norse mythology In order to understand the darkness of Norse folk, it is necessary to confirm the basic nature..."

Kendrick Lamar’s body of work is not a collection of songs, but has a structure closer to a full-length novel or a classic epic poem. His albums go beyond the concept of “song order” and overlap personal and social history while manipulating time, perspective, and narrator. There is no chance or improvisation, but a carefully designed narrative structure. Hip-hop originally developed as an expression that captures the emotions and reality of the moment. Every battle, every block party, every song on the radio had value in its ephemerality. But Kendrick offered a way to use the format to tell long-distance stories. The structure, which can only be seen in its entirety by listening to the album as a whole, requires the listener to actively read it. Furthermore, his story cannot be reduced to self-praise or success stories. Rather, by actively placing failure, fear, regret, and contradiction at the center of the story, he visualizes the ““weakness” and ““silence” that hip-hop has avoided. This overlaps with the history of epic poems, which depict not only the glory..."

Text: mmr｜Theme: The historical structure in which traditional dance music and electronic dance music in Türkiye are linked across cities and eras Turkish dance music does not fit into a single genre or era. Anatolian folk dances, Ottoman court music, urban popular songs, pop music from immigrant societies, and even modern club music have circulated and influenced each other. This cyclical structure is understood as a “ring” in this paper. It is not a linear evolution, but an iterative movement in which traditions are forgotten, rediscovered, and reconnected in different contexts. The history of Turkish dance music has been understood as a cycle of repetition rather than a break. Base of Anatolian folk dance and rhythm Harai, Holon, Zeibek Each region of Türkiye has its own unique dance music. Harai in eastern Anatolia, Holon on the western Black Sea coast, and Zeybek in the western Aegean region all have structures that emphasize groupness and rhythm. The time signatures are diverse, including 2, 5, 7, and 9 beats, and this directly influenced later Turkish pop and dance music.

While the maqam system remains in the melodic structure and decorative turns are used in the singing, from the latter half of the 20th century Western pop music formats were actively adopted. This music had long been premised on local consumption, but in the 21st century, as the distribution environment changed, exposure to the global market rapidly expanded. The internationalization of Arab pop was accelerated by changes in the distribution structure rather than changes in musical styles. Chapter 1: Combining national media and popular music Role of the Egyptian film industry In the mid-20th century, Egypt had the largest film industry in the Arab world, and music was an integral part of film. The songs of Umm Kulthum and Abdel Haleem Hafez were widely distributed through movies and radio, creating a star image common to the Arab-speaking world.

His parents were from England, and there was a natural mix of English and German languages ​​in the family. This duality can be said to be the prototype for the ““sense of distance” and ““sense of balance” found in his music. From an early age, black music such as jazz, soul, and funk was played at home rather than rock. Early on, he developed an ear for paying attention not only to rhythmic dynamics, but also to chord progressions and performance intervals. In particular, the electric bass lines and the spatial expansion created by the chords became important foundations for later productions. As he entered his teens, he became strongly attracted to dance music that was expanding at the time, such as hip-hop, electro, and acid house. What fascinated him here was not the star quality or the lyrics, but the ““structure’’ of the track itself. For Pooley, the subtle changes that occur through repetition and the plasticity of music that is rearranged by DJs presents a new way of looking at music...."

It is a historically compressed space in which colonial rule by European powers, forced deportation from Africa, rupture of indigenous culture, and post-liberation mixing all overlap at the same time. In this environment, music served more than just entertainment. For people who were deprived of language and whose political voice was restricted, songs were a repository of memory, a medium of social criticism, and a device for reorganizing communities. Calypso and soca are its most iconic achievements. Although both are often consumed as dance music, they are laced with resistance to colonial rule, working-class humor, and the tension between urbanization and celebration. It is not enough to simply distinguish that calypso is spoken music and soca is music of the body. Both branches stem from the same root and are the result of responding to the demands of different times. Caribbean music is a place where history itself continues to play as a rhythm.

News, speeches, readings. Music was one of the main contents, but not the purpose. However, music was the element most compatible with the radio device. It transcends language, can withstand long periods of time, can be repeated, and has a direct effect on emotions. This characteristic leads to an inseparable relationship between radio and music. Radio requires music, and music is augmented by radio. A system called broadcasting that reorganized music distribution Until the early 20th century, the distribution of music was bound by physical constraints. Sheet music, records, concerts. All of these required time and money to access. Radio broadcasting instantly collapses this structure. Music will arrive all at once, all at once, and for free. As a result, the concept of ““fad’’ accelerated. The experience of listening to the same song at the same time has elevated music into a social phenomenon. Hit songs were not music that sold, but..."

Text: mmr｜Theme: Examining changes in musical expression from the narrated ayahuasca experience and the choice of silence Ayahuasca is not a device that produces music. It is a ritual system that has been formed over a long period of time in the Amazon basin of South America, and it is not an experience that is completed only within an individual. Nevertheless, in the contemporary musical context, ayahuasca has been talked about simply as a ““source of creativity” and ““an opportunity for awakening.” However, when we follow the words of the musicians who have spoken about their experiences, we find that their narratives are surprisingly cautious, fragmented, and distanced. They do not recount visions or revelations in detail. Do not conclude a causal relationship with the work. What is spoken instead are lingering effects that cannot be translated, such as changes in sensation, the expansion and contraction of time, and changes in the way we deal with sound. This article is not about experience itself. What we examine is the attitude of musicians in how they talk about their experiences and where they stop talking.

Text: mmr｜Theme: A multi-layered cultural history of didgeridoo music, which is rooted in indigenous societies in northern Australia, from regional differences, linguistic differences, and tribal examples. The didgeridoo is a traditional wind instrument that has been used by Australia’s Aboriginal communities, mainly from the northern coast to the interior. Generally, the material is made from a eucalyptus tree trunk that has been hollowed out by termites, and the opening on one side is coated with beeswax to adjust the mouthfeel. Although the structure is extremely simple, the sounds emitted are not limited to monophonic drones, but have complex acoustic layers that combine overtones, rhythm, and vocalizations. The name ““didgeridoo’’ that is common today does not originate from an indigenous language, but is an onomatopoeic name coined by English speakers in the early 20th century. In indigenous societies, musical instruments are named in connection with land and language, and different names reflect differences in culture. The didgeridoo is not a single musical instrument, but a collection of cultural practices that vary by region.

The cultural phenomenon that was occurring in New York’s South Bronx in the early 1970s did not yet have a name, ““hip-hop.’’ There was no unified ideology or awareness of it as a movement. Young people just gathered together, made music, danced, raised their voices, and left their mark on the city. This series of actions would later be organized as a single culture. What is important in understanding this period is that the core cultural practices already existed even before Afrika Bambaataa, who would later become an icon. Hip-hop was not the invention of one person, but a complex phenomenon created by environment and necessity. Hip-hop was not born from an ideology, but was a culture that was given its name from the accumulation of actions.

Text: mmr｜Theme: Digital distortion has changed music–About the technical history and aesthetics of bit crush and low-bit music The history of digital music is often talked about as a history of high-quality sound. Sampling frequencies have increased, bit depth has been extended, and noise has been eliminated. However, on the other hand, expressions that intentionally lower the resolution have repeatedly appeared. Words like bit crush, low bit music, and 8bit/12bit sound technically mean ““limitation” or ““deficiency,” but in music history they have formed a distinct aesthetic and culture. In this column, we will analyze the relationship between bit depth and sound, the limitations of early digital devices, and the flow that led to game consoles, samplers, and DAWs, and interpret the accumulation of facts as to why low-resolution sound became a form of musical expression. Digital music has always encompassed both ““enhancing” and ““destructing” at the same time. Fundamentals of Digital Sound: What Bit Depth and Sampling Mean What is bit depth?

About the history of misreading, transformation, and establishment In popular music, lyrics are not just a means of conveying information. It is a text with extremely high cultural density, encompassing pronunciation, prosody, metaphor, social assumptions, religious views, class sense, and even the atmosphere of the time. Translating lyrics is not a process of replacing languages, but rather an act of transplanting a culture to another environment. This transplant is not always successful. Rather, they are often distorted, missing, and sometimes take on a meaning different from the original. In this article, we will view lyric translation from the perspective of ““cultural import,’’ and will organize its historical development, theoretical framework, specific examples, and characteristics of its reception in Japan, based only on facts. Lyrics translation allows musical borders to be crossed, but it does not erase cultural borders.

Text: mmr｜Theme: How Northern Soul, which was born in England in the 1960s, spread to Japan and gained unique acceptance and support, about the history, culture, and local scene. The term Northern Soul is both a musical genre and a concept that refers to specific cultural attitudes and practices. It is a music culture that was enthusiastically supported in the club scene of northern England, mainly focusing on up-tempo soul music produced in America in the mid-to-late 1960s, especially songs on minor labels that did not achieve commercial success. Its characteristics are clear. The BPM is fast, the 4-time signature is emphasized, a horn section and a dynamic bass line are included, and the song is designed to give top priority to the uplifting feeling on the dance floor. Many of the lyrics are about love or heartbreak, but the emphasis was on rhythms and grooves that evoke physical reactions rather than social messages. It is important to note that Northern Soul did not begin as “nostalgic music.” For young people in the north of England at the time, this was not music of the past, but floor music that was constantly being updated.

The tempo is slow, the riffs are relentlessly repetitive, and the sonic images refuse to be clearly separated. There is a sense of music filling the space, enveloping the listener, and slowing down their movements. What is important in this genre is not the melody or technique, but the quality of the sound. The thickness of the distortion, the pressure of the bass, and the interval of the rhythm. These factors act in a complex manner, and music exists not as a linear progression, but as a precipitating substance. As the genre name suggests, the sonic aesthetics of sludge metal lies in ““stagnation’’. He deliberately distances himself from clear sound, sophisticated structure, and a comfortable listening experience, presenting turbidity and stagnation as values. That attitude has occupied a unique position in metal music culture. The sound of sludge metal exists not to move forward, but to sink into a place.

The Amazon River Basin is one of the most culturally diverse regions in the world. Hundreds of indigenous groups have lived together, each with their own distinct languages, myths, and social structures. In this context, music has developed not as an independent form of entertainment or art, but as an act that is inseparable from life itself. Songs are sung to pray for success in hunting and farming, and dances mark seasonal cycles and milestones in growth. Music is not something you listen to, but something you do, and it is also an act that confirms your membership in a community. Silence is almost nonexistent in the Amazon forest. Birds, insects, wind, and water all make sounds, and human music is also placed on this continuum. Amazonian indigenous music has existed as an act that dissolves the boundaries between nature and humans.

Their active period is extremely short, and their official discography is limited. However, its existence cannot be dismissed as mere prehistory or a preparatory stage. S.O.A appeared on the border between 70”s punk and 80”s hardcore, capturing the tension, violence, and suffocation of young people in the city of New York in a way that couldn’t be erased any further. The band’s name, ““State of Alert,’’ is a word that means constant vigilance. Rather than being a political slogan, this was a literal expression of the state of mind of young people living in New York at the time.

    "body": "Prologue: The incident called Black Flag Text: mmr｜Theme: About a band that left a legacy of method and attitude rather than commercial success Black Flag was more than just a band name, it was a kind of structural change that pervaded the American West Coast underground from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. While they were known for their fast, harsh, and simple playing, they were also beset by practices that would have a decisive influence on generations to come: DIY, self-sufficient touring, and record-making independence. Musically, they continued to reject the linear image of punk, changing from their early three-chord hardcore to the heavier, slower, experimental sound of their later years. The local characteristics of Southern California, suburban culture, repressive daily life, and a tense relationship with the police. Black Flag’s music is inseparable from these specific environments. Anger and emptiness were not abstract things, but an extension of life. Each of their songs, tours, and records exists as a practical response to their environment. Black Flag was a band that functioned as a methodology, not a style. Pre-formation and early formation (1976–1978) Black Flag”s origins lie in guitarist Greg Ginn. The band”s name was Panic when it..."

    "body": "Introduction: The intersection of IDM and jazz Text: mmr｜Theme: About music presented as the structure of time itself The fusion of IDM and jazz has progressed not as an addition of genres, but as a redesign of the sense of time and performance philosophy. By blurring the lines between improvisation and composition, groove and programming, and human power and machines, an aesthetic different from traditional fusion is being formed. Since the 1990s, as club culture and experimental jazz have deepened simultaneously, rhythmic structure itself has become the subject of music. If you understand IDM x Jazz not as a style, but as a methodology for processing time, it is easier to see the whole picture. Establishment of IDM and changes in the view of rhythm Intelligent electronic music after breakbeats In the early 1990s, attempts to subdivide and reconstruct breakbeats progressed, and rhythms that contained change rather than repetition came to be valued. In a field called IDM, the focus is less on the stability of tempo and more on what’s happening inside the beat. Rhythm has changed from being a foundation for dancing to an information structure for listening. Redefining time signature and tempo In IDM, multiple periods often..."

    "body": "Prologue: The moment when jazz stepped into the “unknown” Text: mmr｜Theme: On the essence of Avant-Garde Jazz, which is often distanced from the mainstream as a music of solution. In the mid-20th century, jazz seemed like a mature music. There were distinct styles: swing, bebop, and hard bop, and a shared language of chord progressions, time signatures, and solo structures. However, in the late 1950s, a movement began to doubt this very premise, quietly but surely. Does music really need to follow harmony and form? How free can improvisation be? The movement that would later be called ““Avant-Garde Jazz’’ was born from these questions. Although this music is often talked about as eccentric or difficult to understand, it is actually strongly connected to the history of jazz, and deeply connected to society and ideology. Avant-garde jazz was not about destruction but redefinition, and it was a movement that exposed the potential contained within the music of jazz. Prehistory: Tensions and limits after Bebop Bebop, which was established in the 1940s, greatly increased the freedom of improvisation, but also created highly sophisticated norms. Complex chord progressions, fast tempos, and shared diction were both exciting and new constraints for experienced performers. In..."

It starts with silence, then the slight fluctuations of sound accumulate, and eventually become a large swell that envelops the emotions. This process resonates deeply with the film’s long camera movements and the building of tension through editing. When this music emerged in the late 1990s, rock seemed to have exhausted its many forms. Alternative rock was becoming mainstream, and grunge impulses were becoming a thing of the past. Under such circumstances, post-rock instrumental music presented a completely different sense of time and structure while using rock formations. Explosions in the Sky and Godspeed You! Black Emperor are iconic in this context. The former approaches personal experiences through melodies and heightened emotions, while the latter imprints social and collective time in the form of sound. While active at the same time, both artists demonstrated the breadth and depth of the post-rock framework. Post-rock instrumentals provide a space for the listener to begin speaking,..."

Rather than the superficial images of early punk, such as speed and rebellion, punk is characterized by its underlying impulse of ““denial,” ““refusal,” and ““destruction’’ that extends to the musical structure itself. In this music, skill and pleasure are not important. Rather, phrases that are close to unplayable, dissonance, and rhythms on the verge of collapse are actively chosen. There was a clear distrust of rock’s entertainment and commercial value. DNA and The Pop Group are the most radical embodiment of this attitude. Rather than updating punk, they dismantled it from within, opening up a completely different realm of expression. Noise punk was an attempt to visualize ideas by destroying music. Punk after Punk: Collapse of preconditions Around 1977, punk spread rapidly and at the same time rapidly became formalized. 3 chords, short songs, aggressive attitude.

Text: mmr｜Theme: About Dreamwave/Chill Synthwave, a music genre that does not make excessive claims in today’s information-overloaded society Dreamwave and Chill Synthwave are musical styles derived from synthwave that have become clear since the 2010s. While it is based on the synthesizer culture, visual aesthetics, and urban nostalgia of the 1980s, it is distinctive in that it suppresses aggression and retro-futuristic exaggeration, and emphasizes emotion, resonance, and introspection. These are more like aesthetic intentions and design ideas for the listening experience than genres. Dreamwave has a strong tendency to construct sound images with psychological themes such as fantasy, memory, and dreaming, while Chill Synthwave can be understood as a form that simplifies the tempo and structure and enhances the listenability that blends into living spaces. The two overlap, reinterpreting the ““80s emotion”’ in today”s digital environment. Both styles do not have clear boundaries and exist continuously, centered around emotional design. Historical background: Reinterpretation of 80s culture The 1980s was a period of transition from analog to digital, and the vocabulary of electronic music expanded explosively with the spread of polyphonic synthesizers, FM sound sources, and the MIDI standard.

Neo-Classical Darkwave is a musical trend that formed from the late 1980s to the 1990s, and is a style that partially fuses post-punk dark wave, gothic, and industrial sensibilities with the diction, organization, and aesthetics of Western classical music. The genre name is an afterthought, and it is not a movement that was established from the beginning with a clear self-definition. This genre is characterized by its use of modern recording techniques, repetitive structures, slow tempos, and dark acoustics, while still referencing classical elements such as tonality, mode, and harmonic progression. Lyrics often deal with abstract and symbolic themes such as mythology, religion, views on life and death, time, and memory, and tend to focus on metaphysical expression rather than concrete social criticism. Neo-Classical Darkwave is not a single musical technique, but can be understood as a composite field that shares historical references and dark sensibilities.

Classical music since the latter half of the 20th century has branched out in a variety of directions through experiments with atonality, aleatorism, and electronic music. In the 21st century, a trend that emphasizes ““tonality,” ““repetition,” ““tranquility,” and ““the listening experience itself” has once again gained international attention. This is the area generally referred to as Contemporary Classical or Neo-Minimalism. This trend is unique in that it has been formed across both traditional classical music institutions and independent music production environments. Artists such as Max Richter, Nils Frahm, and Hauschka all have classical backgrounds, but have actively incorporated recording techniques, post-production, improvisation, and electronic instruments. Historical background: Classic after minimalism The establishment of 20th century minimalism Established in the United States in the 1960s by La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass, minimalism was characterized by short repetitions, gradual changes, and clear metrical structures.

This genre is not just a musical style, but has emerged as a comprehensive system of expression that reflects changes in production methods, sound design, performance forms, and even changes in urban culture and the technological environment. EBM did not emerge from a single country or city in a unidirectional manner. It was formed through the intersection of post-punk, industrial, electronic music technology, and club culture in multiple regions, mainly Belgium, England, and Germany. Front 242 and Nitzer Ebb are representative examples of structural and aesthetic formulations in this process. 1. EBM and Electro-Industrial as terms The term EBM was introduced in the early 1980s, and initially functioned more as a concept to indicate a creative attitude and musical direction than a genre name. As the name “Electronic Body Music” suggests, the emphasis is on directly driving physical movement through electronic sounds. On the other hand, Electro-Industrial..."

The genre tends to be defined more by production attitudes and structural orientation than by sharing a clear musical style. The term Art Pop has been used as an umbrella concept to refer to the intersection of pop music with art and thought. On the other hand, Experimental Electronic Pop often refers to the practice of structural experimentation within the framework of pop, with a focus on electronic acoustics. The two have developed while overlapping, and since the 2010s they have increasingly been recognized as almost the same field of expression. 2.

Since the 20th century, music has moved away from the framework of temporal art centered on melody and harmony, and has expanded into a comprehensive realm of expression that includes physical phenomena, space, and the recording medium itself. Avant-garde instrumental and sound art is not a form that shows off the skill and performance ability of an instrument, but rather presents the entire process by which sound is generated, propagated, reflected, altered, and perceived as a work. In this field, musical works are not necessarily reduced to musical scores, nor is the possibility of replayability assumed. Rather, the work exists as a set of conditions, producing different results each time. What is important here, rather than the composer’s intentions, is the structure itself, how the acoustic phenomenon stands up and connects with space and technology.

From the late 2000s to the early 2010s, it became apparent as the digital production environment became more sophisticated, and it became established as functional music that cuts across club, listening, and video applications. Although the genre name is a compound word of “Glitch” and “Hip Hop,” it is not just a mixture of techniques, but a production philosophy centered on beat deconstruction and reconstruction. 1. Historical background and conditions for establishment From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, with the spread of DAW environments and improvements in CPU performance, extreme sample division, nonlinear pitch/time transformation, and real-time effect processing became practical production methods. This created the conditions for glitch-like processing, which had previously been limited to experimental music and art contexts, to move to the center of beat music. Glitch Hop was created..."

    "body": "Introduction: The musical principle of drones Text: mmr｜Theme: About drones that expand music from temporal art to spatial art Drone is a musical principle that uses sustained sound to transform our sense of time, spatial awareness, and auditory concentration. It is unique in that it uses pitch, overtones, timbre, and duration as structural units as an alternative to melody and harmonic progression. In the history of Western music, early examples include the bolden of the bagpipe, the pedal point of the organ, and the sustained bass notes of religious music. Since the late 20th century, with the development of recording technology and electronic acoustics, the drone has moved from being a mere accompaniment element to the main structure of an entire piece. Through this process, Ambient Drone was born, followed by Textural Drone, which emphasizes tonal changes and layering of physical texture. Chapter 1 Background of the establishment of Ambient Drone 1-1. Minimalism and sustained sounds Minimal music of the 1960s introduced repetition and duration as structural principles.

Hip-hop is essentially a culture in which the MC’s verbal expression and the repetitive structure of the beat complement each other. However, since the 1990s, as instrumental works without rap began to circulate independently, beats came to the foreground as a theme rather than an accompaniment. Especially in experimental instruments, there is no need for a homogeneous beat structure or development design for rapping, and time, texture, and fragmentation become the main design targets. “The absence of wrap is not an omission, but an expansion of design freedom.” Terminology: Experimental Hip Hop Instrumentals In this article, Experimental Hip Hop Instrumentals refers to a group of instrumentals that share the following production characteristics. Although the beat structure is based on 4/4, the repetition period is undefined. Samples are not used for the purpose of identifying the original song, but are treated as materials.

The trend known as Avant-Garde Metal or Experimental Metal is not defined by the extremeness of the sound or the sophistication of technique. Its essence lies in an attitude of questioning the structure, time, repetition, and center of gravity that metal has always assumed, and redesigning them. In this article, I will reconsider avant-garde metal not as a deviant expression, but as a structural ideology. At its center are Gorguts and Maudlin of the Well. Both artists dismantled and rebuilt the internal structure of metal music from different directions. Structural assumptions in metal To understand avant-garde metal, it is first necessary to clarify what is the premise behind regular metal. Traditional metal has been formed as a collection of structural assumptions such as the following. Beat is stable and perceptible Riffs are repeated and create gravity Double beats serve as time reference points Songs have a circular structure The climax is designed as a reaching point. Avant-Garde Metal does not deny these assumptions in part, but invalidates them as a..."

Electro Pop Experimental is a general term for a musical trend that is based on the structure of pop music and actively integrates electroacoustic technology, visualization of the production process, visual expression, and self-calculating music production ideas. This field is not a single genre, but has been established as an intersection of multiple technological histories, production environments, visual cultures, and independent distribution networks. While conventional electropop has focused on ““familiarity,” ““repeatable melodies,” and ““danceability,’’ experimental electropop is characterized by the fact that while maintaining these aspects, it incorporates tone generation, structural destruction, personality expression, and alteration of the creator into the music itself. Chapter 1 Premise of electronic music before electropop In order to understand the formation of the electronic pop experiment system, it is necessary to take a bird’s-eye view of the history of the combination of electronic music and popular music in the latter half of the 20th century.

Historically, there have been practices that do not fit within the framework of 12 equal temperament, such as the variability of thirds and sevenths represented by the Blue Note, embouchure operation on wind instruments, and portamento on string instruments. The trend known as microtonal jazz or quarter-tone jazz is characterized by extending these conventions theoretically and structurally, and explicitly placing ““microtonal intervals’’ at the core of the sonic organization. In this article, we will organize the theoretical background and performance practices of microtonal jazz, which was formed from the late 20th century to the 21st century, and analyze it from the perspectives of composition, improvisation, and ensemble operation, with a particular focus on the efforts of Joe Maneri and Jacob Collier.

Following the development of electronic musical instruments in the 1920s and 1930s, magnetic tape technology after the war, and the establishment of musique concrète and electronic music studios in the 1950s, an environment began to emerge in the late 1960s that allowed individual composers to create electronic music outside of the studio. Amid this change, a series of progressive electronic music that later became known collectively as the ““Berlin School’’ was established mainly in West Germany. The Berlin School is not a unified movement or an official school in the strict sense of the word. It is a name that was unified in later music history research and criticism as a result of multiple composers working in a common metropolitan area, technological environment, and musical interests. At its core are composers and projects such as Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Ash Ra Tempel (later Ashra).

Progressive jazz/fusion is a developmental trend in jazz that was formed from the late 1960s to the 1970s, and was established as a result of the simultaneous integration of multiple musical idioms such as modal jazz, post-bop, rock, funk, contemporary music, and folk music. ““Progressive’’ here does not simply mean technical sophistication, but refers to the attitude itself that continues to reorganize musical structure, rhythm design, timbre arrangement, and the relationship between improvisation and composition. Although the term fusion is often understood as a compromise between jazz and rock, the reality is more complex. External conditions such as the standardization of electric instruments, the evolution of PA and studio technology, changes in recording media, and the acceleration of international musical exchange directly influenced performance styles and structural design.

This idea of ​​”“turning the material itself into music’’ became the foundation of the later sound design of Industrial Techno. On the other hand, techno, which was established in the 1980s, is characterized by repetition, synchronization, and gridded time, and has developed in the direction of eliminating human fluctuations. Industrial Techno は、このテクノの時間構造と、工業音楽の素材志向を直接的に接合することで誕生した。 2. Formation of early industrial techno In the early 1990s, a group of tracks with an emphasis on industrial textures appeared at the intersection of hard techno, EBM techno, and dark techno. These are characterized by an emphasis on hardness of tone, density of distortion, and inorganic repetition rather than high speed or radical development. リズムは直線的で、スウィングやファンク性は極端に抑制される。人間的なノリよりも、持続的圧力と均質な推進力が優先された。 3. 2010年代以降の再定義 2010年代に入ると、Industrial Techno は再び強い存在感を獲得する。ミニマルテクノ以降の音響的洗練と、インダストリアル的暴力性が融合し、より制御された形で再定義された。 この時代の特徴は、歪みやノイズが無秩序に配置されるのではなく、帯域・位相・ダイナミクスを厳密に管理した上で組み込まれている点にある。破壊性は設計対象となり、クラブ再生環境に最適化された。 4. Mathematical rhythm analysis Industrial Techno’s rhythm may appear to be a simple 4/4 repetition on the surface, but underneath there is a precise time design.時間軸を t とし、キックの出現時刻を K_i とすると、基本周期 T_K は以下で表される。 K_{i+1} - K_i =..."

Design concept of long-term music One of the important features of Deep Ambient and Ambient Techno is that they prioritize “playback time” over individual songs. Sustaining for 10, 20, or more minutes is a design imperative, not a lack of deployment. When played over a long period of time, short-term stimuli and symbolic developments lose their meaning. Instead, subtle changes, fluctuations in density, and shifts in localization become the center of perception. This shows that music functions as an environment rather than information. 3. Boundary between loop and non-loop The loops in Ambient Techno/Deep Ambient are not a gimmick to make you hear repetition itself.

In this paper, we do not separate the history of musical temperament, theory, acoustic structure, and production practice, but reconstruct them as interconnected movements. 1. Temperament is not a rule but an idea. 12 Equal Temperament is more of an established industrial standard for production and distribution than music theory. This is a response to demands for greater freedom in modulation, mass production of keyboard instruments, and standardization of education, and is not an optimal acoustic solution. The problem with microtonal music is not the numerical value of ““fineness than a semitone’’; This is the very idea of ​​treating pitch as a fixed unit. Pitch is originally a relative concept defined by frequency ratio, harmonic relationship, and physical perception. 12 Equal Temperament is only a temporary frozen state. 2.

Chillhop is a derivative name that emphasizes its listening use, especially the aspect consumed in work/environmental music contexts. The term Lo‑Fi means ““Low Fidelity,’’ and refers to an attitude that treats recording technology limitations and noise as an element of expression rather than a flaw.

Modular Drone/Experimental Drones (hereinafter referred to as “modular drones”) is a trend of acoustic experiments centered on sustained sounds, and has developed in close connection with the structural characteristics of modular synthesizers. A continuum of sound that does not assume a melody or beat creates time by minutely changing elements such as pitch, timbre, intensity, phase, and spatial arrangement. This music emphasizes “existence” rather than “progression,” and changes appear as state transitions rather than events. What is important about modular drones is that the object of listening is not the persistence of a single sound, but the process by which multiple signal paths interact with each other. Modular synthesizers allow you to freely connect elements such as oscillators, filters, amplifiers, envelopes, LFOs, and random voltages, making the boundaries between stability and instability, control and chance audible. By combining this characteristic with the form of a drone, an acoustic expression that expands the sense of time was created. Historical premises of the drone concept The..."

Before concrete music: Thoughts that treat sound as an “object” Text: mmr｜Theme: “Redefining tape music/concrete music in the context of the re-evaluation of 1970s avant-garde music” 1.1 Isolation of acoustic phenomena Before concrete music, music was treated as a combination of abstracted elements such as pitch, rhythm, and harmony. However, with the development of recording technology, sound has been isolated as a temporal and spatial event, and has become an object that can be rearranged. This idea became the starting point for dismantling the distinction between instrumental sounds and environmental sounds. 1.2 Broadcasting technology and experimental space The research facility attached to the broadcasting station functioned as an experimental space different from the performance venue. The sounds played in a space exclusively for reproduction were separated from the performer’s body, and the act of listening itself was restructured. 2. The substance called tape 2.1 Structure of magnetic tape Magnetic tape is a flexible physical medium. Operations such as cutting, splicing, unwinding, and changing speed were all performed as physical acts. This physicality became an important factor for reappraisal in the 1970s. 2.2 Composition as an act of editing Tape editing was seen not as a recording of a performance,..."

Experimental background before formation From the late 1970s to the 1980s, people around industrial music experimented with ““stopping music’s functions.’’ Use of factory sounds, medical sounds, and environmental sounds Frequency design with discomfort in mind Refusal to repeat or expand These attempts resulted in ““music that cannot be heard,’’ and laid the groundwork for the immersive sound that later Dark Ambient aimed for. 3.

The term “shoegaze” came from the way people looked at the effector boards at their feet while performing, and the term became established as a symbol of the introverted nature of the performance. Dream pop, on the other hand, was formed as a result of the fusion of an earlier ambient pop sensibility with the sonic orientation of post-punk. Although the two have different origins, they are closely connected in terms of sound processing, voice handling, and visual sensibilities. [“The genre name was an afterthought, and many of those involved were not aware of its classification at first.”] Chapter 1: Prehistory and formation of dream pop 1-1.

Neo-Psychedelic Folk is a musical trend that has been reconstructed using recording technology, visual sensibilities, and rhythmic concepts since the 2000s, while referring to the aesthetics of psychedelic folk and acid folk from the 1960s and 1970s. It is characterized by its active use of studio processing, editing, and electronic effects, while building on folk-derived acoustic textures, ethnic melodies, and repetitive chord progressions. This trend was not limited to a specific geography or a single scene, but was formed intermittently across North America, Oceania, and Europe. The prevalence of DIY culture, indie labels, and digital recording environments has influenced all stages of production, distribution, and reception, making it a crucial difference from traditional folk renewal movements. “Forks were treated as material to be re-edited, not as something to be saved.” Chapter 1: Historical Assumptions - Continuity from Psychedelic Folk 1-1.

In the 21st century, the aspiration for the “future” that originated in Futurist art in the early 20th century has been linked to digital production environments, post-internet visual culture, and the redefinition of gender and body representation, reconfiguring music and visual expression as inseparable.

Historical background: from futurism to post-digital 1-1. Futurism and musical experimentation Italian Futurism in the early 20th century focused on machines, speed, and noise as objects of beauty. Luigi Russolo’s noise music theorized a departure from melodicism and had a strong influence on later experimental music.

Its distinctive feature is that it retains the sense of time of club music while also functioning as music for appreciation. Deep Ambient (so-called deep-sea ambient) has a higher level of abstraction and does not require the presence of beats. The main focus is on extremely deep sound images, sustained sounds centered on low frequency bands, and compositions that obscure the contours of time. 2. Prehistory: Divergence and approach of ambient and techno Ambient music, which was formed in the 1970s, embraced the idea of ​​music functioning as part of the environment.

At the beginning of the 21st century, music performance spaces gradually expanded from physical venues such as clubs and concert halls to spaces where music is distributed via the Internet.

NTS Radio and Boiler Room have different origins and philosophies within this flow, but they are the ones that have made live streaming culture visible internationally.

It combines historical elements such as horn riffs, clarinet and violin, and scat vocals with samplers, sequencers, loops, and bass-heavy beats.

Clicks, noise, digital distortion, pitch shifts, Vocaloid-like processing, rapid song development, bizarre tempo fluctuations – the most distinctive feature of this album is that it attempts to express a ““balance between excess and decay’’ by fusing these elements in a highly pop context. Acts such as SOPHIE, A. G. Cook, and 100 gecs took this “broken pop” to an international level, proving that many artists could “create a global musical language from their own rooms” through DAWs and sample packs. 1. Origin and background 1-1 Prehistory of musicalization of digital failure sounds The idea of ​​glitch itself goes back to the aesthetics presented by electronica in the late 1990s (Oval, Alva Noto, Ryoji Ikeda, etc.). He treated CD reading errors and digital signal malfunctions as musical materials, and actively cited the ““aesthetics of failure.’’ Glitch music from this era was more experimental, with an emphasis on texture, space, and structure rather than..."

Text: mmr｜Theme: About the “emotional dubstep” born between silence and bass Chillstep and Liquid Dubstep are spin-off genres that began to take shape on the internet around 2010, emphasizing the melodic and ambient aspects of dubstep. Unlike traditional dubstep’s aggressive wobble bass, harsh filter modulation, and post-brostep metal leads, Chillstep brings to the fore ““quietness, transparency, and a soft-defined low range.’’ The background flow is as follows.

Eden) 2010s: Spread of “Chillstep Compilation” on YouTube Artists such as Blackmill and MitiS have established a melody-oriented style The result was ““dubstep as an emotional expression,’’ which absorbed liquid elements from ambient, trance, and drum and bass, and grew into a genre deeply connected to EDM, lo-fi, and beautiful video editing culture. 1. Roots and establishment: late 2000s to early 2010s 1-1 Dubstep evolution and melody development Dubstep was originally rooted in the London underground and was characterized by heavy sub-bass and harsh snare sounds. However, from 2008 to 2010, tracks with a melodic approach became popular on YouTube and SoundCloud. Features include the..."

This name is a comprehensive framework that refers to the entire process by which the structural principles of funk established in the 1970s have been reorganized while embracing electronic musical instruments and digital production environments. The essence of funk lies in repeated rhythms, bass lines, and a physical sense of time, rather than chord progressions or melodies. Electro-Funk/Modern Funk has changed its production methods and sound design without losing its essence. As a result, multiple achievements have been made, including studio-based electronic funk and performance-based extended funk. Chromeo and Jamiroquai derivatives are symbols of this parallel structure, and this article will focus on both to describe the formation process and internal structure of the genre as a whole. Chapter 1: The original structure of funk Funk is rhythm and bass driven music. Harmonic progressions are kept to a minimum and the same phrases are repeated for long periods of time.

Starting from the deep bass, dub-derived spatial processing, and garage rhythm structure of traditional dubstep, it is distinctive in that it has expanded into R&amp;B, soul, experimental electronic music, ambient, and art-oriented beat music. In South London (Croydon, Brixton, etc.), which was the center of early dubstep, there existed a ““dark sub-bass sound’’ that was established through the DMZ party culture, but from around 2006 to 2009, young producers began to introduce more diverse elements. Representatives of this generation include Burial, Mount Kimbie, and James Blake, who later gained worldwide acclaim. By incorporating not only club culture but also ““urban reverberations’’ such as city noise, late-night traffic, cell phone recordings, and field recordings as sample materials, they created a new emotionality that was not present in conventional bass music.

Its distinctive feature is that it goes beyond simply pursuing the beauty of harmonies, and spans a wide variety of techniques, including the exploration of acoustic phenomena using voice as a material, spatialization, microtonal manipulation, phase structure, and fusion with electronic processing. This trend presented a new listening style to traditional choral culture and had a major impact on acoustic art as a whole. 1. Introduction The most primitive musical instrument in human history is the voice, and the collaborative expression of multiple people through voice has developed closely with religious rituals and community structures. However, the modern image of ““chorus = disciplined, homogeneous harmony’’ is actually just a set of values ​​that became dominant during a limited period from the 19th to the 20th century.

With the availability of tools such as recording/editing technology, effects, sampling, real-time processing, and generation technology, the voice has acquired a diverse role as an instrument, texture, spatial description, and even data resource. Artists like Bjork and Imogen Heap, who use their own voices as the main material for their experiments, and expressions created by technological breakthroughs such as granular synthesis and AI-based resynthesis, have greatly expanded the possibilities of the voice. Chapter 1: Historical context of voice manipulation 1-1. Recording technology and tape generation By the mid-20th century, recording and tape manipulation provided the first major venues for vocal manipulation. Techniques such as changing the speed of the tape, cutting it up, and playing it backwards created a way to strategically alter the temporal and frequency properties of the voice and derive new musical meanings. In radio works and electronic music experiments, voices were sometimes separated from their existing linguistic meanings and transformed into sonic textures. 1-2. The..."

Birth and origins of Mathcore Evolution from hardcore punk Mathcore’s roots lie in the hardcore punk and metalcore of the late 1980s and early 90s.

Improvisational music, electroacoustic music, noise, field recording, modular synths, and digital samplers intersect, establishing a unique practice system that differs from traditional jazz-oriented free improvisation and acoustic school. 1. What is EAI? EAI is an abbreviation for “Electroacoustic Improvisation,” and it began to be used internationally around the year 2000 to refer to improvisation using electroacoustic processing and processing technology. Although there is no clear unified definition, the following are common points: Improvisationally operate electronic equipment (modulars, laptops, effectors, samplers) Blurring the boundaries between live instruments and electronic sounds Active use of sustained sounds and subtle sounds (hum, hiss, signal sounds) Breaking away from traditional rhythmic and melodic structures \"”The performance itself’’ is also subject to appreciation. Although it is a generation before live coding, it focuses on electrical operation Although EAI is often talked about in the context of improvised music, it is more appropriate to call it a..."

Text: mmr｜Theme: About the genealogy of cloud rap that intersects with Lo-Fi Hip Hop Cloud Rap arose around 2010, centered around the Bay Area and U.S. Internet Underground, and developed while connecting with post-vaporwave subculture aesthetics, Chopped &amp; Screwed, Lo-Fi Hip-Hop, and modern emo rap. In particular, the activities of Lil B, Clams Casino, and Main Attrakionz symbolized the early days, forming the basis of a lineage that would later lead to Lil Peep, XXXTENTACION, Bones, and Yung Lean. Cloud Rap was far more ambient-oriented than traditional Hip Hop, featuring a more ambient-oriented sound, vocal processing with strong reverb, and dreamy textures with spatial FX, and later evolved into Vaportrap, absorbing electronic music and Vaporwave-like meme culture. I. Preparatory steps before Cloud Rap (2000–2008) ● Hip-hop and mixtape culture from the internet In the late 2000s, MySpace and DatPiff expanded the mixtape culture of Internet distribution, allowing collaboration without geographical constraints. This became the soil that gave rise to Cloud Rap’s ““liberation from geography.’’ ● Influence of Chopped &amp; Screwed Screw processing (slowing speed, changing pitch, emphasizing reverberation), derived from DJ Screw’s method, greatly contributed to the ““ethereal tempo’’ of later Cloud Rap.

In terms of DJ performances, songs like Stardust”s ““Music Sounds Better With You” and Cassius’ ““1999” are moving the younger crowd again, and Daft Punk”s early works are finding new audiences through vinyl reissues. Furthermore, as domestic and foreign producers actively incorporate analog synths, tape textures, roughness of sampling, and vinyl lip texture, they are naturally connecting with the context of Nu Disco, which was established in the late 2000s. This phenomenon is not just nostalgia. Rather, it is precisely because the digital environment has become completely pervasive that The ““temperature of analog”, ““the fluctuation of filters”, and the ““physicality of record culture’‘ are being reinterpreted.

Text: mmr｜Theme: Comprehensive research on reinterpreting Famicom/Game Boy sound sources into modern times The sound known as Chiptune, or 8-bit music, has transcended the confines of a nostalgic genre that simply evokes the sounds of retro games, and continues to have a unique power in modern music culture. There are many reasons, but the most fundamental one is ““universal musicality born from constraints’‘**. The sounds of the Famicom/NES and Game Boy are both built with a limited number of channels, limited waveforms, and a limited range of tones. However, the melodies that were born from within these constraints are all unusually memorable. It has an extremely high melodiousness that anyone can memorize the melody within just a few seconds of listening. Furthermore, in modern times, the ““digital purity’’ that these tones provide is once again being valued. The overtones are well-balanced, the sound image is simple, and there is a high degree of freedom in arrangement. These qualities are very compatible with contemporary music, especially electronic, EDM, hyperpop, ambient, and techno.

Dr. Dre production, P-Funk-inspired synth swells, thick bass lines, and smooth mellowness. But the voice of Nate Dogg (real name Nathaniel Dwayne Hale, 1969-2011) has special meaning. His singing voice is neither rap nor R&amp;B, but something in between, yet different from both. The dry texture and depth of the bass, the thickness and smoothness derived from gospel music. He has revolutionized the role that “songs” can play in hip-hop, and continues to influence many artists to this day. Above all, he became recognized as an artist who was stronger than anyone else when he could sing the hook, and was sought after by almost everyone in the West Coast scene at the time. 1. Early life and roots: Gospel and Long Beach Nate Dogg was born on August 19, 1969 in Clarksdale, Mississippi.

In the history of Japanese music, Boredoms occupy a unique position as an entity that cannot be fully explained in any context. Formed in Osaka in the late 1980s, they went on to influence musicians around the world, morphing into noise, hardcore, avant-garde, psychedelia, and later rhythm ensembles. Because Boredoms transcends genre boundaries, it cannot be captured in a simple historical narrative. However, their activities were certainly linked to the times, and at the same time disconnected from them. Chapter 1: Pre-formation history and strata of Osaka Underground In the 1980s, Osaka had a unique underground culture that was different from that of Tokyo. A mixture of theaters, abandoned buildings, and live music venues created many places where the boundaries between punk, hardcore, noise, and performance art were blurred. Yamatsuka Ai, the core member of Boredoms, sought out her own expression while absorbing this cluttered environment. In his early years, Ai’s activities were strongly performance-oriented, and he practiced not only sound, but also body movement, objects, and collage-like expressions.

At the center of this were artists including Sun Ra and Pharoah Sanders. They not only innovated musical styles, but also treated ““space’’ as a comprehensive art that included visual presentation, thought, and philosophy. 1. Origin: Sun Ra and the formation of Afrofuturism From the late 1950s to the 1960s, Sun Ra developed a sound and ideology that significantly deviated from traditional jazz forms. He described himself as ““a being from Saturn,’’ and developed a thorough cosmic worldview. The costume has metallic luster robes, helmets, and abstract geometric patterns. On stage, a performance reminiscent of an extradimensional ritual or a futuristic city unfolded, completely integrating music and visual expression. In terms of performance, the band was full of very cutting-edge experiments at the time, such as collective improvisation through an orchestral formation, use of electric instruments, and early synthesizers.

Krautrock is a genre born from trial and error with the following characteristics: Pursuit of repetitive rhythm: Neu!’s “Motorik beat” is especially iconic. By mechanically repeating 4/4 of the drum, a trance-like and meditative feeling is created. Electronic sound experiments: Make full use of analog synthesizers like Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to reevaluate past masterpieces, with reissues and new generations of artists taking over the works. 1. Origin and background In the mid-1990s, jazz-funk and drum and bass were rapidly developing in the UK club scene. In this context, music with freer and irregular rhythms emerged as an offshoot of traditional four-on-the-floor house and jazz-funk. This formed the basis of the genre that would later be called Broken Beat.

The sound is warm and rich, as if ““you can feel a living thing or organic breath deep inside the cables and knobs of a modular synth.’’ By choosing vintage or modular equipment, especially Buchla-style modular equipment, she creates a sonic ecosystem through ““accidentality”, ““instability”, ““manuality”, or ““electrical vibrations and resonance with the body”, rather than just synthetic sounds. By carefully weaving together voices, live instruments, field recordings, nature and physicality, he elevates the modular from a “cold machine” to a “living vessel of sound.” People who love modular and Buchla-style synths will be strongly attracted to this attitude.

Text: mmr｜Theme: About the Modular Techno scene Modular Techno is an electronic music genre that combines sound design centered on modular synthesizers with the rhythm structure of techno. Particularly in live performances, it is characterized by the artist’s ability to improvise sounds and rhythms by patching synth modules and operating CV/Gate in real time. Although its origins as a genre date back to the early 2000s, its foundational elements are deeply rooted in the emergence of analog modular synths in the 1970s and the formation of Detroit techno in the 1980s. Due to the high degree of freedom of modular synths, it is often possible to develop unique sounds that emphasize the texture and spatial expanse of the sound, rather than simply playing techno tracks. In his live set, he manipulates rhythm, bass line, percussion, and noise effects in each module to create an improvised musical space that changes. As a result, listeners can experience an experience that is more like ““experiencing a performance” than ““listening to a track.” Historical background and origin Early techno and analog synth In the 1970s, modular synthesizers developed by Robert Moog, ARP, and others offered new possibilities for music production...."

This work was released by Nonesuch Records, a label specializing in classical music, and was groundbreaking in that it presented electronic sounds as a “work” in an unprecedented way at the time. Subotnick”s innovations go beyond simply composing electronic music; he is also important as a key figure in the development of Buchla”s West Coast synthesizer, and has had a long-term influence on modern modular synth culture. 1.

Although his music crosses genres such as house, broken beat, jazz, soul, and electronica, it always has a pure “temperature”. The combination of experimentation and warmth is surprisingly similar to the aesthetics of the label EGLO Records. In the club/dance music scene, there is often talk of ““trends” and ““the ups and downs of a genre.” However, among these labels and works that remain over time, there is a ““thought” and ““community” that is more than just a trend.

There are multiple reasons. These are reissues by Western labels, YouTube”s automatic recommendations, Spotify”s algorithm, and a reappraisal of electronic music/new age. However, there are important points that cannot be explained by these factors alone. This is the fact that Japan’s ““environmental music’’ in the 1980s was born from a different cultural soil than ambient music around the world. While Western ambient music (beginning with Brian Eno) aimed at “sounds that melt into the background without stealing attention,” Japanese environmental music was closely connected to ““urban planning, architecture, commercial spaces, product design, art, consumer electronics culture, and philosophy of life.’’ The following composers were at the center of this.

    "body": "Introduction Text: mmr｜Theme: Waajeed’s life and works, and his role in the genealogy of Detroit When discussing Detroit”s musical history, the focus is often on the giants of the early days of techno. However, there are many artists who have “re-integrated” the city”s own black music bloodline–hip-hop, gospel, soul, house, jazz, and techno–and sublimated it into new forms of expression since the 2000s. One person at the center of this is Waajeed. Starting his career around Slum Village, he has continued to make Detroit’s musical aesthetic function as a “platform for connecting to the future” with Platinum Pied Pipers (PPP), Tiny Hearts, and his own label Dirt Tech Reck. Since the late 2010s, he has been building a body of work that more directly follows the flow of Detroit house/techno, while also bringing to the forefront the expression of black roots. In particular, \"”Shango EP” (2017) and one of their current masterpieces, \"”Mother EP” (2018) are positioned as works that strongly present the spirituality and community nature of club music while inheriting the traditions of Detroit. 1.

His birth name was Frederick Russell Jones, and he was interested in music from an early age. At the age of five, he began playing the piano and, at the encouragement of his mother, received formal musical training. Pittsburgh was a thriving jazz city at the time, with plenty of opportunities to perform at local clubs and radio stations. While in high school, he began playing in local dance bands, laying the foundation for jazz. In 1944, he began performing professionally at local clubs. During World War II, he served as a musician in the Army, playing piano in the military orchestra. During this period, he gained experience in improvisation and small trios, which influenced his later style. After the war, Jamal moved to New York and made his first recording in 1947. In 1949, he recorded some works under his own name, and it was around this time that he began to develop the characteristics of ““minimalist piano performances that make use of space.’’ Important career turning point 1951 — Debut album..."

Text: mmr｜Theme: Unraveling the history of EGLO’s main artist K15, his views on music, and his signature song “Sunbeams” In London’s underground music scene, K15 (real name: Kieron Ifill) has been recognized as a band that gracefully straddles the gap between club music and spiritual jazz. Although his music crosses genres such as house, broken beat, jazz, soul, and electronica, it always has a pure “temperature”. The combination of experimentation and warmth is surprisingly similar to the aesthetics of the label EGLO Records. In the club/dance music scene, there is often talk of ““trends” and ““the ups and downs of a genre.” However, among these labels and works that remain over time, there is a ““thought” and ““community” that is more than just a trend. Eglo Records, founded in London by Floating Points and Alexander Nut, is a representative independent label that emphasizes continuity and diversity. In Eglo”s catalog, K15”s ““Sunbeams’’ is a unique and iconic work that combines elements of house, broken beat, Latin, and jazz.

There are multiple reasons. These are reissues by Western labels, YouTube”s automatic recommendations, Spotify”s algorithm, and a reappraisal of electronic music/new age. However, there are important points that cannot be explained by these factors alone. This is the fact that Japan’s ““environmental music’’ in the 1980s was born from a different cultural soil than ambient music around the world. While Western ambient music (beginning with Brian Eno) aimed at “sounds that melt into the background without stealing attention,” Japanese environmental music was closely connected to ““urban planning, architecture, commercial spaces, product design, art, consumer electronics culture, and philosophy of life.’’ The following composers were at the center of this.

Because of his diversity, it was not easy to get a bird’s-eye view of his activities at the time. Because individual works were fragmented and scattered, listeners were unable to grasp the ““whole picture.’’ However, with the compilation album Deconstruction of the 80s, things changed completely. This album is a compilation of the multi-genre and multi-project sound sources that Laswell was involved in in the 1980s, remastered and reconstructed.

The Helsinki-based duo of Mika Vainio and Ilpo Väisänen has thoroughly dismantled the boundaries between techno, industrial, noise, and minimalism, creating works of highly pure electronic vibrations that can be described as ““the rawness of electricity’’.

The wide-ranging sonic philosophy of leader KK Null (Kazuyuki Kishino) continues to form the core of the band, and has had a strong influence on the underground scene in Japan and abroad. Their music is layered with noise, metallic guitars, destructive drums, repetitive structures, and electroacoustic textures. The history of Zeni Geva, which has been active intermittently from the 1990s to the present, is extremely important as a nexus between Japanese noise culture and overseas underground. 1. Formation period (1987–1990): origins of violence and structure Zeni Geva was formed in 1987. The central character is KK Null.

In the 1980s, mainstream rock was centered on loud arena-sized hard rock, commercially polished AOR, and pop rock associated with MTV. On the other hand, in regional cities and university towns, a new movement of bands rooted in the DIY spirit and not based on commercial success began to emerge. In the United States at the time, independent labels such as SST Records, Twin/Tone, and Touch and Go were producing a variety of styles that were not dependent on genre. This was a movement called ““college rock’’, a band that inherited the speed and anti-authoritarianism of hardcore punk, but had a freer experimental spirit. Around the same time, in Britain, the post-punk scene was branching out underground in a complicated way. Labels like Factory, 4AD, and Creation all had their own unique aesthetics, releasing a wide range of bands from guitar pop to shoegaze to gothic rock. These lines eventually converge into..."

Built around Genesis Breyer P-Orridge”s ideas and vision, Psychic TV”s efforts remained at the forefront of counterculture from the 1980s to the 2000s, fusing industrial music, psychedelics, acid house, performance art, and ritual culture. 2. Origin and background 2.1 Genesis P‑Orridge and COUM Transmissions Genesis Breyer P‑Orridge (1950–2020) is one of the most influential figures in the British avant-garde. He became involved in countercultural activities from a young age, and in the 1970s led a performance group called COUM Transmissions. COUM develops performance art influenced by fluxism, incorporating provocative and political themes into their art. Through his work with COUM Transmissions, Genesis developed a strong interest in the integration of visual art, music, and performance, which laid the foundation for his subsequent work. He also formed Throbbing Gristle, which became internationally recognized as pioneers of industrial music. 2.2 Throbbing Gristle disbandment and Psychic TV formation Throbbing Gristle was formed..."

The founding members were classically trained musicians, including David Harris (violin), John Schneider (viola), and Hank Douglas (cello). Since its formation, Kronos Quartet has explored a wide range of genres, including contemporary music, world music, film music, and even pop. Their music goes beyond traditional string quartets and is known for their innovative performance techniques and innovative repertoire selections. 2. From formation to early activities (1973–1980s) Since its inception in San Francisco, the Kronos Quartet has been exploring a performance style outside of the traditional framework of classical music. Founder David Harris studied classical music at the University of California, Berkeley, and then became active in the San Francisco music scene, forming a quartet with like-minded friends. In addition to baroque and classical works, the early repertoire included new works by contemporary composers. Their debut album, ““Kronos Quartet,’’ released in 1976, was highly praised by critics for its combination of the esoteric nature of contemporary music and the high level of performance technique.

Major music groups led by Bad Boy Records were expanding their glittering sounds, but on the street side, an increasing number of artists were seeking a more rigid and politically charged style of expression. At the center of this was Company Flow. Their 1997 album Funcrusher Plus is a landmark in indie hip-hop history.

Clubs were completely shut down by the government, and the entire scene was fundamentally shaken, including tourism, economy, culture, music production, and social values. Germany is one of the countries in the world where the “institutionalization of club culture” is the most advanced, and clubs are treated politically as cultural facilities and are even on the agenda of urban policy. Therefore, the changes in the 2020s are not just changes in music genres, but are also largely recorded in research on cultural policy, urban planning, tourism economy, and subculture in German society.

He became familiar with music from an early age, and was exposed to soul, funk, and early hip-hop through the influence of his brother. In particular, the underground club culture of New York in the late 1970s and early 1980s had a major influence on the later Wu-Tang Clan sound. RZA studied music theory on his own and was interested in sampling and rhythm construction, while at the same time absorbing his own ideas from kung fu movies and philosophy books. What he learned at this stage became the foundation for his later production style and musical philosophy. 2. Formation and early works of Wu-Tang Clan In 1992, RZA formed Wu-Tang Clan with GZA, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa.

In the late 1970s, downtown New York formed a unique musical space where the impulses of punk and the improvisational spirit of avant-garde jazz intersected. At its heart, James Chance and the Contortions pushed the fusion of avant-garde and dance-punk to its extremes. 1. James Chance’s early life and musical background James Chance (real name James Siegfried) was born in Wisconsin, USA in 1953 and studied piano. Influenced by free jazz, especially Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler, he aimed for expressions that were not tied to existing musical forms. He moved to New York in 1975, and after playing in early bands such as Flaming Youth and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, he formed Contortions, a band that realized his vision. 2.

The 12-bit sampler was not just a “technological halfway point,” it created unintended sonic characteristics, resulting in a new production method and musical language. In the days before “high resolution” like 16-bit and 24-bit were idealized, 12-bit, combined with memory constraints, produced unique sonic contours, distortion, and quantization noise. This was not a drawback for many producers, but rather a raw material for tonal design. Chapter 2: Basic technical knowledge — sampling theory and 12bit characteristics 2.1 Basics of sampling There are two main parameters in the process (sampling) of dividing analog signals into numerical values ​​by dividing them into fixed time intervals: sampling frequency (Hz) and quantization bit depth (bit). Sampling frequency is described by Nyquist theory, and quantization bit depth is related to dynamic range and quantization noise. 12bit: Theoretically, the dynamic range is about 72dB (ideal conditions). In reality, the effective dynamic range varies depending on the equipment used, due to the effects of circuit noise and analog paths. 2.2 12bit acoustic characteristics Quantization noise tends to become apparent, especially..."

Rather than a band, they can be called a ““musical body of thought,” and their unique sound that transcends the boundaries of ensemble form, instrumentation, and genres is still hailed as ““one-of-a-kind.” It’s not folk, classical, ambient, or world music. Although it includes all elements, it does not belong completely to any category. This is PCO’s greatest appeal, difficulty, and reason for its enduring support. The central figure, Simon Jeffes, started a ““quiet revolution’’ that had nothing to do with trends in Britain, where punk new wave was sweeping the scene. Systematic minimalism, a cross-ethnic approach to instruments, and a musical outlook filled with humor and poetry.

Chapter 1 Background of the formation and the situation of the Congolese music scene By the late 1960s, Congolese music had already formed a competitive live culture in the Grande Quartier. As powerhouse bands such as OK Jazz, African Fiesta, and Zaïko competed with each other, and the sophistication of guitar ensembles and vocal polyphony accelerated, the number of independent labels supporting the success of young musicians was increasing.

The scene seemed like a wasteland, but its crevices became a hotbed of music. Post-punk artists quickly moved beyond the rock format into dub, reggae, African percussion, noise, electronic sounds, and DIY recording techniques. It was precisely during these complex times that a young producer named Adrian Sherwood rose up and began forming the vast network that would become known as On-U Sound.

His performances are not just a display of rhythmic technique, but are accompanied by a deep spirituality that sometimes induces a trance, inviting the audience on a physical and conscious journey.

Early life and origins Mortazavi was born in 1978 (or 1979) in the ancient capital of Iran, Isfahan.

Text: mmr｜Theme: A comprehensive analysis of Detroit and Underground Resistance from the perspectives of urban history, political ideology, acoustic engineering, Afrofuturism, the Drexciya myth, and world city comparisons. Underground Resistance (UR) is more than just a techno group. It is “an idea for the black community to reclaim its future in the midst of urban decay,” and is itself a resistance movement in the form of music. Detroit is America’s most degraded city, its most deindustrialized city, and its home to an explosion of black cultural creativity. The glory of Motown, Ford’s mass production, the exodus of the white middle class from the suburbs, red lining, skyrocketing unemployment, cities with over 70% black population, and the birth of techno.

Koyaanisqatsi –Directed by Godfrey Reggio, music by Philip Glass. There is no narration or dialogue in this movie. What is shown are only images of nature and human society.

Its origins date back to the Vedic period, around 1500 B.C., when the recitation of mantras and poetry was closely associated with meditation and religious rituals. The sound vibrations played a role in calming the mind and sharpening the physical senses. For example, chanting ““Om’’ (ॐ) causes the low-pitched vibrations to resonate throughout the body, which has the effect of regulating breathing and heartbeat. Ragas (combinations of scales) in Indian classical music were used as a means to adjust the state of mind and body depending on the season and time of day. Even today, yoga and music are inseparable. In the studio, meditative background music, natural sounds, and ambient music are played in conjunction with breathing exercises and asanas, making it easier for even beginners to enter a state of concentration. The integration of breathing, movement, and musical rhythm naturally creates harmony between mind and body. Combining Yoga and Music: A History, Science, and Practical..."

Tracing its birth, transformation, and the intersection of club culture In the mid-1990s, there was a sonic revolution quietly underway in London’s underground clubs. Its name is “UK Garage”. Based on American Garage House, they have established a unique “shuffling rhythm” by combining jungle rhythms, R&amp;B vocals, and Jamaican sound system culture. This new sound was more than just a genre of club music, it served as an expression of urban multiculturalism and immigrant communities. UK garage eventually branched out into 2-Step, Speed ​​Garage, Grime, and Dubstep, becoming the cornerstone of current UK bass culture. Chapter 1: Roots—American Garage and UK Reinterpretation The origins of UK garage can be traced back to the US Garage House that flourished in the late 1980s, namely the New York deep house produced by Larry Levan and Todd Terry.

Japanese subculture music, once considered “Galapagos culture,” has transcended national borders as a unique system of expression in the 21st century. At its root is the phenomenon that music functions as a translation device for cultural codes. Go beyond language and evoke “nonverbal empathy” through visuals, concepts, fashion, and physical expression. This article will delve into how Japanese subculture music gained worldwide support from a cultural sociological perspective, centering on visual kei and idol culture. Chapter 1: “Style” and “Narrative” of Visual Kei Visual Kei was established in the late 1980s with X (currently X JAPAN) and BUCK-TICK. This genre, which added aestheticism, theatricality, and gender ambiguity to a Western rock structure, functioned more than music as a device for presenting a ““worldview.’’ For overseas listeners, the appeal of Visual Kei lies in its expressiveness that transcends musical genres...."

Exploring the “Showa Retro” phenomenon that is spreading as a symbol of YouTube, TikTok, Vaporwave, and Retro Japan In the 2020s, tags such as ““Showa Retro,” ““Showa Kayo,” and ““Japanese 80s Pop’’ are spreading explosively on SNS and streaming services around the world. It was a symbolic event that Miki Matsubara”s ““Midnight Door~Stay With Me” and Tatsuro Yamashita”s ““Ride on Time” suddenly appeared on Spotify’s global charts. However, this ““Showa pop revival’’ is not just a nostalgic hobby. Rather, it is a rediscovery of analog sensations in the digital age and a new cultural phenomenon of global “emotional sharing”. In this article, we will explore how Showa songs resonate overseas and how they are being received and reconstructed. We will explore it from multiple angles, including (1) historical background, (2) media environment, (3) overseas reception structure, and (4) the perspective of musical translation. Chapter 1: Structure of Showa songs as “memory” Showa Kayo is a broad category that refers to Japanese popular music from the 1950s to the 1980s. The range is extremely wide,..."

In the late 1990s, a bright change was coming to the frontier of electronic music production. While analog/equipment-based production using hardware synthesizers and drum machines was the norm, one piece of software shook up that ““normal’’. That is the ReBirthRB‑338 by Propellerhead Software, a software/music production tool manufacturer from Sweden. What this software offered was the possibility of ““making those legendary equipment (Roland TB‑303, Roland TR‑808, Roland TR‑909) usable on your personal computer.’’ ReBirth bypassed the hurdles of obtaining hardware, the cost of maintaining it, and the difficulty of transporting and operating it, and introduced a new wave of ““democratization through software,” which is why it was an event that could be called a ““shock”. Prehistory: Context of the analog equipment/hardware synth era Looking back at the electronic music/club music scene, from the 1980s to the mid-1990s, many famous instruments occupied important positions as “equipment.” Among them, the Roland TB-303 (bassline synth) and TR-808/TR-909..."

In the mid-1990s, the world of electronic music/PC music production was at a major turning point. Traditionally, hardware synthesizers, dedicated equipment, and recording studios were the main focus, limiting the environment in which individuals could freely produce and present songs. However, advances in PC (Windows) and software technology have ushered in an era in which people can freely create sounds at home. Meanwhile, “Jeskola Buzz” by Finnish developer Oskari Tammelin appeared around 1997 (or is said to have had an alpha version before then). Buzz is a freeware (free distribution) modular tracker/sequencer for Windows that has been supported by many users. The biggest attraction was the environment in which ““sound sources (generators), effects (machines), and routing (wiring) could be freely assembled to recreate ““modular equipment” on software.” This ““modular + tracker” configuration, unlike the GUI-centered DAWs (digital audio workstations) of the time, allowed for ““experimentalism” and a ““patch-like” approach, giving rise to a high degree of freedom in..."

The nightscape of the city and the sounds that reflect nostalgia are now a cultural phenomenon that resonates around the world. At the end of the 1980s, the term ““city pop’’ seemed to have ceased to exist in the Japanese music world. However, in the 2020s, this genre is making waves on streaming charts around the world. “Plastic Love” has been played tens of millions of times on YouTube, and playlists such as “Tokyo Night Drive” and “Japanese City Pop” consistently remain at the top of Spotify. This phenomenon is not just nostalgia. Behind this rediscovery led by chance by an algorithm lies a universal desire for music that coexists with urban sophistication and nostalgia. For young listeners overseas, these sounds are a symbol of ““retro-future.’’ Neon lights, the pavement after the rain, the warmth of analog recordings - they see the romance of the future in the “foreign past” that cannot be found in their own country’s music. DJ Night Tempo said, “This music is nostalgia for the future.” In other words, rather than..."

Text: mmr｜Theme: Music Easel, which even in modern times is praised by many live artists as the “smallest orchestra that can be played alone” The Buchla Music Easel, which appeared in 1973, is a portable version of the famous analog modular Buchla 200 series. Designer Don Buchla called the instrument a “portable composition environment.” It was not just a small modular, but was conceived as a ““personal improvised device.’’ “Easel is a sonic canvas. You can’t save the lines the player draws at the moment.” — Don Buchla Chapter 1: Don Buchla and the “Anti-Moog” Philosophy In the early 1960s, two major trends in the development of electronic musical instruments arose in East and West America. Moog in the east and Buchla in the west. Buchla aimed to “generate” sound rather than “control” it. A touch plate was used instead of a keyboard, and the focus of performance was on rate of change and contingency rather than pitch. His philosophy was carried over into the later Music Easel. Easel is an instrument for humans to perform with electronic circuits, and what exists there is the attitude of a ““co-author” rather than a ““performer =..."

It was the moment when Cuban song, African ritual music, and Harlem jazz met. Sabu Martinez”s congas roared like flames, and Arsenio Rodríguez”s tres sounded like it defied theory. In this article, we will discuss the “structure of Afro-Cuban music” that the two men built from their respective sides. Delve into the three layers of culture, society, and music theory. Chapter 1: The birth of Afro-Cuban - From the black earth and the Caribbean Sea At the end of the 19th century, Cuba was coming to the end of its history as a Spanish colony. However, behind the hustle and bustle of the War of Independence, another revolution was underway - that of music. Yoruba and Congolese ritual rhythms intersect with Spanish melodies, creating songs such as “son,” “rumba,” and “abakua.” This created a multi-layered rhythmic structure. **Religious elements: ** Ritual rhythms such as Santería’s ““bata drum” and Congolese ““makuta” have..."

His sound certainly breathes the ““aesthetics of space’’ that the city of Kyoto has. The lingering sound of a temple bell, the dampness of a summer shower, the clear flow of Shirakawa in winter.

    "body": "Prologue: Sound as breathing, improvisation as space Text: mmr｜Theme: Jazz is not about technique or genre expansion, but about the fundamental question of what sound can bring to humans. When we first come into contact with Nala Sinephro’s music, we are forced to let go of the concept of a “song.” His debut album Space 1.8, released by Warp Records in 2021, was a work that melted the boundaries between jazz and ambient, modular synthesis and improvisation as if it were breathing. Harp, tenor saxophone, modular synthesizer, and space itself. Nala’s music depicts the moment when the sound itself becomes a “spiritual environment.” It is an experience that feels like ““the universe breathing in silence,’’ and turns the listener’s body into a resonating body. Chapter 1: The birth of the London scene - Wind from the South When people talk about the resurgence of jazz in London, what always comes to mind is the geographical energy of South London. Sons of Kemet, Nubya Garcia, Shabaka Hutchings, Moses Boyd, and others have established a new jazz vocabulary, but Nala Sinephro is the one who has rebuilt the sound from the ““silent side’’. She has St. Lucian and Belgian roots and studied..."

In the spring of 2004, an album released by a small label in Los Angeles, Stones Throw Records, quietly overturned the conventional wisdom of hip-hop. Madvillain \"”Madvillainy”’ —It”s a rap album, a poetry collection, and a sound collage through radio waves. ** At the beginning of the 21st century, American hip-hop was moving toward the extravagant “brand culture” symbolized by Jay-Z and 50 Cent. On the flip side, this album is about anonymity and the poetics of fragments, and it has deep roots in the world’s underground.

What was ringing there was Three Suns―― It was a symbol of American home music in the 1940s, consisting of an accordion, guitar, and electric organ. This was a time when the war was over and television was not yet widespread. The music that played in people’s living rooms was neither jazz nor classical music, but the sound that symbolized ““relaxation’’ itself. At the center of that sound was the accordion. Three Suns’ music quietly influenced generations to come, pioneering lounge, exotica, and space-age pop. Chapter 1: The Three Suns Phenomenon - Music for the Home Three Suns was formed in 1940 by Pennsylvania brothers Al Nevins (guitar), Morty Nevins (accordion), and their cousin Artie Dunn (organ).

Sampling is a technology that most directly embodies ““quotation” and ““reconstruction” in the history of music. From the early days of hip-hop in the late ’70s to today’s electronica, a single drum break, bassline, or scream has been transformed into hundreds or thousands of songs. 1. The Winstons – “Amen, Brother” (1969) Commonly known as “Amen Break”. The six-second drum solo spawned countless genres, including hip-hop, jungle, drum and bass, and hardcore techno.

At the end of the 1960s, Miles Davis’s music was no longer an extension of his live performances, but instead transformed into a “sound architecture” constructed through recording and editing. Behind the change is producer and editor Teo Macero. Masero was not just a “behind the scenes” person. In his hands, a huge number of session tapes were cut and pasted and reassembled, resulting in a group of works that can be called ““composition by editing’’. ““In a Silent Way” (1969) and ““Bitches Brew” (1970) are prime examples. There is a revolution in editing aesthetics that goes beyond the boundaries between ““performance” and ““composition”.

The symbol of this is the red plastic hat they wore on stage and in their music videos – Energy Dome. This strange, futuristic design was more than just a costume. According to DEVO, it is “a device for reusing the energy that humans wastefully emit.” It was also a device that embodied their philosophy of De-Evolution through humor and irony. Chapter 1: The idea of ​​De-Evolution The band name DEVO comes from “De-Evolution” – the paradoxical concept that “humanity is not evolving, but rather degenerating.” This idea was born in response to the turmoil in America from the late 1960s to the 1970s: the Vietnam War, environmental pollution, and the runaway consumer society.

When many people hear his music for the first time, they feel a sense of ““loneliness” and ““tranquility.” However, deep down, there is a tension between nature and technology. For Brunner, who grew up in the Bavarian forests of southern Germany, sound is not a product of the city; It was an organic thing born out of fog and humidity, wind and shadow. In recent years, the term ““forest bathing’’ (Shinrin-yoku) has been attracting worldwide attention, even in Japan. It is not just healing, but the act of reconnecting human senses to the natural environment. This concept and Recondite’s sonic world are strangely intimate.

In 1978, an unusual band appeared in the port city of Bristol in southwestern England. Its name is The Pop Group. Although they called themselves pop, their music was not funk, punk, or jazz, but rather an experiment in which all genres collided explosively. Their sound evokes the unemployment, class, political corruption, and alienation of young people that covered England in the 1970s. It was sublimated as a “scream” of the sound itself. It wasn’t just music, it was ““anti-establishment physical expression” and ““an art that brings together fragments of ideas.” The city of Bristol is a port city with a history of slave trade and a multicultural mix.

The person who has continued to stand at the center of this is Masami Akita (Merzbow). His sound is violent yet meditative, destructive yet organic.

Introduction: Current status of bear damage and the importance of sound Text: mmr Theme: An analysis of the damage caused by bears, which has been increasing in recent years, from the perspective of the impact of noise and behavior control. Examining the role of sound design in the coexistence of humans and bears In recent years, damage caused by bears has been rapidly increasing in Japan. There are approximately 1,000 cases of crop damage per year, and human damage has approximately doubled in the past 10 years (Ministry of the Environment’s ““Wild Animal Damage Statistics 2024’’). The physical measures taken so far are not sufficient, and sustainable damage control methods are required. What is attracting attention is the ““control of bear behavior through sound.’’ Bears have a well-developed sense of hearing and are sensitive to human voices, warning sounds, and artificial sounds at specific frequencies. In recent years, an increasing number of demonstration experiments have been conducted by farmers, local governments, and research institutions, expanding the possibilities of sound management based on scientific evidence. 2.

How has her musical sensibility given a steely resonance to her words, policies, and ideas? Sanae Takaichi is often described as a ““conservative,” ““strong-minded,” and ““a fighting woman.” However, at its root lies the impact of the heavy metal music he heard in his youth. Metal is a music of passion and construction, an art that confines passion within order. Her school band played songs by Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, and she also likes to listen to bands like Judas Priest, and these sensibilities form the ““acoustic skeleton” of her political language and cultural outlook. Chapter 1: Metal, a spiritual device Metal is an art of passion, but also an art of order and construction. His style of controlling strong emotions through mathematical constructs is consistent with Takaichi’s political speaking style.

It could be the intro to a song, some noise from the radio, a riff you happened to hear at a club, or a melody someone hummed on a street corner at night. In this column, I will use my own experience with ““10 seconds of sound” as a starting point to explore how sound is connected to memories, shapes culture, and influences our ““way of life.” Chapter 1: The moment that 10 seconds rang - the origin of personal experience 10 seconds of “Health and Efficiency”. Those 10 seconds of the loop completely rewrote my auditory world. At that time, I only listened to music as an emotional expression with lyrics.

How Don Buchler and Serge Tocheny”s ideas have been carried over into today”s sound design Early 1970s, America’s West Coast. There were people who left their university’s electronic music studio and tried to take a device for designing sound back into their personal creative spaces. Their names are Don Buchla and Serge Tcherepnin. Buchla and Serge are often talked about as the so-called “progenitors of modular synths,” but they actually stand out in that they sought to create philosophical tools rather than commercial instruments. Their design philosophy contained an “anti-normative” sonic perspective that is common to today’s Eurorack, Max/MSP, and even AI-based generated music. 1. Don Buchler: Poetics of Electronic Sound 1-1. From San Francisco Tape Music Center At San Francisco’s Tape Music Center in the early 1960s, artists like Morton Subotnick and Pauline Oliveros were exploring new relationships between experimental music and technology. What they were looking for was ““an instrument that was not an extension of the piano or guitar.’’ The Buchla Series 100 (1963–1966) appeared in response to Subotnick’s request. Traditional musical operability was intentionally avoided, such as the acoustic circuit..."

Richie Hawtin has been redefining “techno” since the early 1990s, not just as dance music, but as a “sound meditation device.” His works under the name Plastikman, particularly ““Sheet One” (1993) and ““Consumed” (1998), are experiments in visualizing the internal space of the human body with electronic sound, and the sound, which resembles cold liquid, is also called ““abstract sculpture of sound.’’ Chapter 1: Echoes of Detroit, Solitude of Windsor Richie Hawtin was born in Banbury, England in 1970 and moved to Windsor, Canada as a child. From this city across the Detroit River, he could see the early days of Detroit techno at the underground clubs Music Institute and The Shelter. Hawtin was influenced by the spirit that resides in the mechanical rhythms of Juan Atkins and Derrick May, and reconstructed it from a perspective of calm structural beauty. There is always a paradox in his music: heat through distance. Cities..."

In the early 1990s, Richard D. James (Aphex Twin) emerged as someone who completely turned the existing grammar of genres like techno and ambient on its head. His early works are sound experiments in which mechanical dreams and human illusions intertwine, and his current sound lies between an artificial intelligence structure and a return to nostalgia.

The silence is often broken by a single note on the piano or a haunting singing voice. This act is both intuitive and deeply scientific. Music is a ““resonator’’ of emotions and the only experience that can be shared in solitude. In this paper, while crossing the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and cultural history, We will explore the question, “Why do people listen to music when they are sad?” Chapter 1: Sadness and the Brain - Neural Resonance Structure According to modern neuroscience, sadness is strongly associated with activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the brain. By listening to music, these areas undergo “emotional restructuring” and Encourages the process of objectively viewing one’s own emotions. Music is not just an external stimulus, but a ““mirror of nerves.’’ When you listen to a sad melody, “sad neurons” resonate in your brain, The feel-good chemical dopamine is secreted there. This contradictory reaction—”pleasure in sadness”—is what This is one of the biggest reasons why people seek out sad music...."

Considering the reconstruction of the relationship between humans and the world as told by music without sound When John Cage”s ““4”33’’ premiered in New York in 1952, audiences were perplexed and agitated. The pianist doesn’t play a single note. However, the venue was filled with sounds: coughs, chairs creaking, and the wind outside. At that moment, it became clear that music is not just composed sounds, but the act of listening itself. Cage speaks. “There is no silence. Everything is sound.” This philosophy greatly expanded the realm of music and was passed on to 21st century sound art, field recording, and ambient music. Chapter 1: What is listening to sound? — Listening as sensory retraining We do too much “unconscious listening” in our daily lives. Smartphone notification sounds, subway announcements, street noises. They recede into the background of consciousness and become just a piece of information.

Club culture is just another face of modern society created by this ““night city.’’ After the Industrial Revolution, when the boundaries between work and leisure, day and night, and order and deviation were clearly delineated, people escaped into the night streets and created new communities through music and their bodies. Chapter 1: The rhythmic device of the city — industrialization and the liberation of the night Industrial cities at the end of the 19th century realized a ““24-hour society’’ with night lighting. When the lights come on, the city at night transforms into a place not only for work but also for entertainment and desire.

An anthropological study of sound as an archive of melody, time, and emotion At one moment, a melody plays on the radio, instantly bringing back the scenery that he had forgotten for years. This is the power of sound memory, similar to smell. Neuroscience has also shown that music directly stimulates the hippocampus (memory) and amygdala (emotions). But more than that, music is an ““art of time” and a ““reenactment of the past.” Listening to music is not just entertainment, but a physical act of replaying the past. It existed even before recording technology was invented; it was a way for humans to “share memories” through voice and rhythm. Chapter 1: Memory and Rhythm — Music as a “structure of time” The most fundamental structure of music is rhythm. Rhythm is the order of time, and through repetition it brings the past back into the present. Festivals, prayers, and dances. All of these are acts of experiencing the circle of time. Carving out a rhythm is the very act of consolidating memory. In ancient oral culture, poems and myths were passed down in rhythm. This..."

An anthropological exploration of the relationship between the beat and the body, from ancient rituals to club culture to the rhythms of the AI ​​era. When you hear a sound on the dance floor, your body reacts before logic. My feet and hips unconsciously begin to beat. This is a feeling that goes before ““listening” and is a completely different perceptual circuit from ““understanding” music. Anthropologist Andre Leroy-Gourand He defined human culture as the “extension of the body.” Just like stone tools and writing, rhythm is also an extension of the human body. In other words, dancing is the first technology of civilization. Chapter 1: Drums and Ritual - The Origin of Rhythm 1. The birth of sound was accompanied by “breathing” From an archaeological perspective, the earliest “musical instruments” were percussion instruments. It is a stone or tree beaten for hunting or prayer, Creating a “beat” was also an act of creating a community. In many tribal societies in Africa and Oceania, The drum was both a means of transmitting information and a central part of rituals. The rhythm of heartbeat is a metaphor for life,..."

A solitary artist who explores the soul of sound at the border between club culture and ambient. Tracing its tranquility and cosmic nature In the early 1990s, Japan’s electronic music scene was still in its infancy. While techno and house were becoming popular as imported culture, ambient music, which focused on “environmental sounds” and “silence,” was still a minority experimental genre. Susumu Yokota was a poet who lived in this quiet space. His music is an extension of club culture, yet somehow ““outside’’ it. He was a rare artist who used electronic particles to depict the breath of nature, the distance of the wind, and the reverberations of memories. Although Yokota started out in Tokyo’s club scene, he quickly transcended that context. His music focused more on “pause” than the “rhythm” of dance music, and moved toward pursuing the tranquility and organicity of electronic music. This is similar to the Japanese sense of ““wabi-sabi.’’ Chapter 2: Susumu Yokota as a writer — Poetry of soundscape Yokota’s early works are heavily influenced by acid house. Acid Mt. Fuji (1994) was a groundbreaking work that fused natural sounds..."

The moment your fingers touch the strings, the sound is generated from the vibrations of your fingers and reaches the world through amplifiers and effectors. The tone produced by a guitar acts like a mirror, reflecting a person’s emotions, mental state, and even cultural background. The image of a guitarist is different between Japan and the world. In the United States and the United Kingdom, blues and rock have become the foundation, and the genre has evolved into a mainstream one. However, Japan has experienced a more complex and free-flowing development, from the postwar electric boom to underground noise, improvisation, and post-rock.

Even in the days when Buddy Rich and John Bonham dominated the main stage, another heartbeat was beating somewhere in a warehouse or small jazz bar. They were often too excessive, too free, and difficult to understand. However, a new rhythm was born from that “blank space”. Underground drummers were playing time rather than instruments. It was neither a nation nor a genre, but the language of a ““sensory community.’’ Introduction: What is rhythm?

When the subwoofer in a club shakes the air, or when a hit hits your chest at a live house, At the center of this is an invisible gravity called the “base.” I. Listening to music with your body, not your ears Bass is a sound that your body reacts to before you hear it. He stands between rhythm and harmony, and determines the center of gravity of music.

It was a statement of ““a community connected through music” and a desire to ““transcend existing genres and commercial structures.” In the early 2000s, the club scene was in the midst of major changes. Trance was formalizing and progressive house was becoming rigid. In it, James Holden was exploring sounds that move back and forth between melody and noise, analog and digital, intelligence and emotion. “Border Community” was born as his “border laboratory.” II. Landscape of 2001: Dawn of Post-Progressive In 2001, Holden gained attention with the song “A Break in the Clouds” released on Silver Planet.

Text: mmr｜Theme: A full-length cultural theory that traces the “future nostalgia” of synth pop, from YMO to Charli XCX Pop music seemed to take on a new lease of life when synthesizers became more than mechanical sounds and began to play with emotion. Synthpop, which was born in the late 1970s as technology evolved, continues to give us a cold yet beautiful feeling of “nostalgia for the future.” Chapter 1 The moment electronic music became “pop” In the 1970s, synthesizers from Moog, ARP, and Japanese manufacturers like Roland and Yamaha democratized music production. Electronic sound, which until then had been the preserve of gigantic studio equipment, gradually found its way into homes and live music venues. Kraftwerk’s “The Robots” is inorganic, as if questioning the boundaries between humans and machines, yet resonates with a strange sense of humor. The vision they presented of ““man = machine’’ became the concept that underpinned all subsequent pop music. Gary Numan, Human League, and Depeche Mode carried on that spirit. They replaced rock’s passion with synths and turned cold urban melancholy into beats. This was a time when the word “future” still contained both hope and fear;..."

In the early 1980s, Chicago’s club scene was experiencing a lull due to the decline of disco. As disco grew commercially and disappeared from radio and the mainstream, young people were looking for a new outlet for musical expression. One of the answers was the music that later became known as ““Chicago House.’’ The Warehouse club was a musical testing ground during this period.

If we look at the history of records, we can see how this “intermediate format” marked a turning point in the times. 10 inches is not just a matter of size. It was also another philosophy that redefined ““length of time” and ““density of sound.” The restriction of around 10 minutes per side forced artists and engineers to choose ““condensation,’’ and the result was a surprisingly well-defined sound and a listening experience that required concentration. “Just long enough to take a drink by the time you finish listening.” The aesthetics of 10 inches resides in this sense of time. 10-inch as a history of technology: Balance of rotation speed, groove width, and sound quality The appeal of the 10-inch cannot be explained simply by being “in between the sizes.” It is built on an exquisite..."

In the 2010s, horror movies have transformed into an art form that is more conscious of sound than ever before. Jump scares are a thing of the past, and instead low frequencies, environmental noise, and reverberations dominate the scares. This was also an application of the psychoacoustic discovery that hearing affects the deeper psyche more directly than vision. Horror movies of this era not only gave fear, but also ““eroded”’ the audience”s inner world through sound. At the center of this change was a new generation of production studios such as A24 and Blumhouse.

Since her debut in 1988, she has avoided flashy productions and over-the-top production, and has continued to depict society with acoustic tones and a quiet speaking voice, and her journey slowly stirs the soul of the listener. In this article, I would like to trace her upbringing, creative process, sound technology, important relationships, and intersection with the times, and decipher why her songs still resonate today. Chapter 1 Cleveland Landscape: Birth and Origin ● Sensitivity nurtured by home and environment Tracy Chapman was born on March 30, 1964 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

The single ““Where Were You / I’ll Have To Dance Then (On My Own)’’, released in 1978, symbolizes their early punk spirit. ““Where Were You?’’ depicts the loneliness of young people and their doubts about society with sharp guitar riffs and vocals mixed with noise. The B-side, I’ll Have To Dance Then (On My Own), expresses self-alienation and the desire for freedom with punk energy.

While speech was increasingly controlled under the military regime, young people were inspired by British and American rock and sought new sonic freedom. At the forefront of this movement was the Tropicália movement. Along with the poet Torcato Neto and the artist Hélio Oiticica, the musical leaders were Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. With the goal of “redefining Brazilian music,” they freely fused bossa nova, samba, folklore, and rock. “Tropicália is the tropics in our souls.” — Caetano Veloso, 1968 In the studios of the time, ““manual overdubbing” was repeated, taking advantage of the limitations of recording equipment. ““Psychedelic sound technology” was born, including physically cutting and pasting reel-type tape and rotating the tape backwards to create reverse echoes.

Memories of defeat, the flood of American and British culture, and the emptiness of not having a voice.

However, if you look at fashion shows in recent years, you will find that the two have built a surprisingly close relationship. Intimacy between fashion show and noise Since the 1990s, high-end brand shows have actively introduced not only rock and classical music, but also noise/industrial music. Balenciaga made industrial noise roar in a ruin-like space, presenting clothing and space as ““aggressive beauty.’’ Rei Kawakubo of COMME des GARÇONS has been drawn to experimental music since the 1980s, and has layered repetition and dissonance into fashion. Yohji Yamamoto alternated between tranquil classical music and roaring noise in his show, acoustically visualizing the “white space” and “excess” of clothing.

Occultism of Led Zeppelin and Jimmy Page Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page is more than just a rock guitarist, he is known for his deep devotion to the world of occultism and mysticism. In particular, he had a keen interest in the study of Aleister Crowley, an early 20th century magician and thinker. Page actually purchased Crowley’s former residence, Boleskine House, and is said to have studied his thoughts and rituals. This fact is not just an urban legend, but a highly confirmed episode that has been mentioned by multiple music journalists and biographers.

This trend continues from pioneers such as Aphex Twin and Autechre to the modern experimental electronic music scene. Early 1990s: Birth - The germ of “dance music for listening” At the end of the 1980s, in the midst of the UK rave culture and techno craze, underground labels and artists began to explore ““electronic music for home listening’’ rather than just a club tool.

It is characterized by an aesthetic that can be described as ““bass supremacy”’ while drawing on the trends of UK garage, 2-step, jungle, and drum”n’bass. London at the time was a melting pot of immigrant cultures, with deep roots in reggae, dub, and Jamaican sound system culture. Dubstep, which was born from this soil, has undergone a unique evolution centered on heavy sub-bass, dark and tight spatiality, and subdivided rhythms. Sound characteristics Dubstep is supported by the physical pressure of bass sounds, so much so that it is said to be ““music that you listen to with your body.’’ Tempo: BPM approximately 138-142. Rhythm: Broken beat structure derived from 2-step. The kick is not a four-beat beat, but the snare is emphasized on the third beat. Bass: Characterized by deep sub-bass, distorted bass line, and so-called “Wobble Bass”. Mood: Dark, minimal or experimental sound design...."

It has developed through a mix of ambient, contemporary, ethnic, and environmental music, and is characterized by a meditative, non-aggressive sound that makes full use of synthesizers and acoustic instruments. The melodies are simple, often with long sustained notes and repeated structures, and the rhythms are often purposely omitted or very slow. For this reason, it played a role as “healing music” and was associated with spiritual lifestyles and back-to-nature movements. Origin and historical background 1970s: With the rise of interest in New Age thought and Eastern philosophy, it spread among people who wanted to meditate and return to nature. Krautrock (Tangerine Dream, Popol Vuh, etc.) and the ambient works of Brian Eno became the soil. 1980s: Labels such as Windham Hill Records and Private Music were established, and artists such as George Winston and Kitaro gained worldwide popularity.

Tresor (meaning ““safe”’ in German) is a club that was founded in Berlin, Germany in 1991, and is a center of techno culture that also hosts a label of the same name. Amidst the chaos that followed the end of the Cold War, it served as the most important center for connecting Detroit techno and Berlin”s underground culture, and continues to maintain its international influence to this day. Background of its birth: Berlin and the post-Cold War vacuum In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. Spaces that were once controlled by the state have turned into ““lawless zones’’ and become testing grounds for underground youth culture. Abandoned buildings, disused factories, and underground spaces have been turned into clubs. Western and Eastern cultures fused, and dance music, a symbol of freedom, resonated. Among them, Tresor opened in a renovated vault of a former department store. The deep bass sound emanating from behind the closed iron door symbolized the beginning of a new era.

Musical features and innovations The musical characteristics of new wave can be organized into the following elements: Rise of the synthesizer With the spread of analog synths and drum machines, mechanical and futuristic sounds were created. Gary Numan and Ultravox are prime examples.

The sound was characterized by fast tempos (120-140 BPM), synth-based riffs, and dramatic female vocals, and had a more cathartic and energetic feel than traditional disco. Hi-NRG had a particularly strong following in gay clubs. After the Stonewall Riots in the 1970s, the LGBTQ community sought a place for their expression and identity in the club scene, and Hi-NRG functioned as their “music of liberation.” Role of Hi-NRG in LGBTQ 🌈 symbol of freedom At a time when homosexuality was still subject to discrimination and prejudice, Hi-NRG provided “a space where people could dance and love each other without being tied down by anyone.” Club dance floors were safe spaces where people could escape from the oppression of society, and Hi-NRG was essential as background music. 🌈 Expression of identity Hi-NRG’s lyrics often have themes of love, desire, and self-liberation, and they resonate not..."

The origin of the name goes back to the label ““Acid Jazz Records’’ founded by DJ [Gilles Peterson] (https://amzn.to/3KOnzMr) and record producer [Eddie Piller] (https://amzn.to/4hdwdAb). In the club scene of the 1980s, there was a growing movement to reevaluate black music in response to the enthusiasm for acid house and hip-hop. Acid jazz emerged as ““danceable jazz” and ““soulful music suitable for clubs.” Musical features Acid jazz tends to refer to a ““hybrid feeling’’ rather than a single genre. Characteristic elements include: Groove emphasis: Inheriting the rhythmic feel of 70’s funk and rare grooves Improvisation: Introducing solos and interplays derived from jazz Club-oriented: Remix-like development with DJ play and dance floor in mind Sampling Culture: Incorporating a hip-hop approach and reconstructing past jazz-funk sound sources Urban sophistication: Has a stylish mood with a mix of Latin and soul.

Origin: Industrial reverberations and mechanical rhythms EBM is a genre of electronic music that originated in Europe (mainly Belgium and Germany) in the early 1980s. The name comes from the fact that the music is composed of a physical dance groove and electronics. This can be described as a fusion of industrial music and electronic dance music. In particular, the following two groups are known as pioneers: Front 242 (Belgium) DAF (Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, Germany) By making full use of cold, sharp electronics, violent minimal beats, and militaristic vocals, they created a new kind of “physical electronic music” that differs from conventional pop and rock. Sound characteristics To put it simply, EBM’s sound is “inorganic and physical.” It features the following elements: Hard and minimal beat Mainly 4/4 time signature, BPM around 120-140 Mechanical rhythm like industrial machinery Heavy use of drum machines (Roland TR-808, TR-909, etc.) Synthesizers and Sequencers Monochrome, dark, heavy synth sound Loop configuration driven by analog/digital sequencer Balancing the trance state and physicality created by repetition Vocal Low, inorganic voices, mostly male voices Speaks in a commanding tone, slogan-like rather than singing.

The origin of this genre was born from the “accidental misuse” of an electronic instrument called the Roland TB-303 Bass Line Synthesizer. Originally developed as a bass guitar replacement, the TB-303 was used by DJs and producers (particularly from a unit called Phuture) in unexpected ways, producing undulating, ““liquid” and ““psychedelic” basslines. Phuture’s 1987 single “Acid Tracks” became the prototype for this new style, both in sonic character and name. Sound characteristics: Chemical sound image brought about by TB-303 The most important characteristics of acid house are the following sound elements: Baseline with TB-303 Unique “purpy” and “squish” sound Mysterious acoustic changes caused by filter resonance and slide Analog randomness and manual operation organicity Quadruple kick BPM is a stable tempo of around 120-130 Standard combination with drum pattern by TR-808 or TR-909 Minimal structure Trip feeling due to repeated loops Create a sense of ecstasy with long build-ups and detailed changes This sound had..."

Generally, the BPM (tempo) is around 60 to 110, and it is characterized by relaxing rhythms and sounds aimed at listening and chilling out, rather than intense beats for clubs. In between the throbbing heartbeat and the hustle and bustle, a sudden silence appears. If it”s music, downtempo is that moment of deep breathing. In the world of club culture and electronic music, it is a music genre that is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the fast beats of techno and house, but it is close to the listener”s emotions and blends into the city night. That’s downtempo. Downtempo is created through the intersection of multiple genres, including the floating feel of ambient, the grooves of hip-hop, and the organic elements of jazz and soul. Although it often overlaps with styles such as chillout, trip hop, and lounge music, it is also used as a general term for a gentle groove that encompasses these styles. 90’s Chill Out Revolution From the late 1980s to..."

Why did Eurobeat, which was born in Europe and evolved in its own way in Asia, become deeply connected to the Parapara style in Japan? There was a mix of factors such as not only musical characteristics but also club culture, media strategy, and consumer psychology. What is Eurobeat? ─ Evolution of Italo Disco Eurobeat has its roots in “Italo Disco”, which was born in Italy in the 1980s. Adding elements of high energy (Hi-NRG), the tempo changes to a catchy, synth-driven sound. ● Main musical characteristics BPM: 140-160 and very fast Structure: Clear chorus, frequent use of refrains Rhythm: 4/4 drum + handclap Melody: Bright, dramatic, and melancholy This structure was a perfect match for the parapara dance, which repeats the same pattern. What is Parapara? ──Pleasure of uniform repetition ● Origin of Parapara Occurred in the late 1980s at discos in Roppongi and Shibuya, Tokyo (Maharaja, Juliana Tokyo, etc.) Group dance with finely aligned hand movements..."

The story takes place on a mountain pass in Gunma Prefecture, and the main character, Takumi Fujiwara, learns drifting skills while delivering tofu in his father’s AE86 (Toyota Sprinter Trueno), and gradually awakens as a runner.

Film music scores have been in circulation, but there are no records of them being used as media. ● The advent of talkie films and sound recordings (1927~) Starting with [\"”The Jazz Singer’’ (1927)] (https://amzn.to/3Wn4CTH), Optical Sound was introduced, and we entered an era in which audio information (scores) were recorded on video film. Around this time, the meaning of ““soundtrack = audio material..."

    "body": "From “music to listen to” to “music to feel” Text: mmr｜Theme: Ambient, environmental music, electronic music culture theory Ambient is a genre of music that is not intended to be “actively listened to” by listeners, but rather to “exist in a space.” He eliminates clear melodies and rhythms and instead uses sustained sounds (drones), environmental sounds (field recordings), and acoustic processing to construct auditory landscapes. This genre is extremely philosophical music that stands on the border between music and art, sound and space, perception and consciousness. From the words of Brian Eno It was British musician Brian Eno who defined the term ambient as a musical genre. In 1978, he wrote the following in his masterpiece [Ambient 1: Music for Airports] (https://amzn.to/48shEpU): “Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.” ““Ambient music must not force itself to be heard, but at the same time allow itself to be ignored.’’ In other words, ambient music is not background music, but it functions like background music. It is “spatial art” that flows in the background of consciousness. Genealogy and origins of ambient ● Prehistory:..."

Combining fast breakbeats, roaring bass lines, and reggae/dub/hip-hop/techno, they revolutionized UK music history. Its evolution has been incredible, with many branches ranging from jungle, liquid funk, and techstep to neurofunk, jump-up, and drumstep. From Jungle to D&amp;B ● 1990-1993: Jungle movement D&amp;B’s roots lie in the jungle genre. This was a chaotic beat music that was a mix of acid house, rave, hip-hop, and reggae, and centered around a sampling of Amen Break.

It”s punk. However, even this punk style eventually began to turn inward, sometimes formally. It was hardcore punk that once again unleashed the flames of anger. In this column, we will delve into the definitions and differences between punk and hardcore from the perspectives of music, ideology, fashion, and history. What is punk? ▍Musical features Simple chord progression (mainly 3 chords) fast, rough rhythm Short song duration (about 1-3 minutes) Non-melodic, screaming vocals Representative bands: The Ramones (US), Sex Pistols (UK), The Clash (UK) ▍Thoughts and values Anti-system/anti-authority: Distrust of the state, police, companies, religion, etc. DIY spirit: Make your own music, make records, print flyers, and perform live. **Anti-fashion yet fashionable: **Safety pins, mohawks, leather jackets, etc. ▍Cultural background In Britain in the 1970s, a recession, soaring unemployment rates, and a sense of isolation among young people became social problems.

Britain not only embraced this music, but expanded it from the underground to clubs, raves and venues for sonic experimentation. In this article, we will cover the overall picture of 90s UK techno from the perspectives of culture, music, people, and labels. Fusion of rave culture and underground Following the ““Second Summer of Love”’ in 1988, the UK was engulfed in an explosion of acid house and rave. In the aftermath, various subspecies of hardcore, breakbeat, and techno grew underground in the early “90s. On the other hand, the end of the Thatcher government and widening economic disparity caused young people’s dissatisfaction and rebelliousness to be imprinted in music.

First of all, the core of “Smokers Delight” lies in its “relaxed groove.” The album opens with “Nights Introlude,” featuring soft strings and a gentle beat that samples Quincy Jones’ “Summer In The City,” instantly drawing the listener into a relaxing space. Musically, the hip-hop skeleton is woven with the essence of reggae, soul, and funk, giving it a unique eclecticism. For example, in “Groove St.,” a deep piano bass line intertwines with a smooth bassline, and the addition of light drums creates a simple yet addictive loop.

He turned to house music in 1985, the same year that the first wave of Chicago house arrived in New York, and in 1989, while still working as a courier, he began releasing some of his early work on several small record labels in New York. A year later, they caught the attention of Belgium’s R&amp;S Records, who released their first major record, Energy Flash, by mid-1990, with a string of equally impressive releases to follow. Throughout the 1990s, he continued to make timeless music on the cutting edge label of the time.

This EP is a very strong opener with its disturbing musical themes, and “Time After Space” has a cosmic feel. “Detached” is probably one of his best works. “Black Avenger” draws listeners in with its percussive frenzy and hard keys.

It was probably processed by the E-MU sampler”s Z-plane filter. This Reese sound was used on a variety of tracks, including “Nasty Ways,” “Take My Life,” “Love Is Not a Game Remix,” and “Bambaata Remix,” and variations of it were also used on “Tudor Rose” and “Go Dillinja.” It’s no exaggeration to say that this Reese sound is probably the coolest drum &amp; bass sound ever created.
