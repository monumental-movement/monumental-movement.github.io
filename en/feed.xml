      <description>Prologue: Those heading south — the modern “paradise” fantasy
Text: mmr | Theme: Exploring the sounds of utopia and escape through Brian Eno &amp;amp; John Cale’s “Wrong Way Up” and “The Beach” starring Leonardo DiCaprio
At the end of the 1990s, the world still believed in the word “paradise.” The end of the Cold War, the birth of the Internet, and dreams of globalization.However, cracks were already appearing behind that dream. Brian Eno and John Cale’s ““Wrong Way Up’’ (1990) and Leonardo DiCaprio’s ““The Beach’’ (2000) stand on opposite ends of that chasm.
Both stories are about heading south. It depicts the loneliness and disillusionment that lurks in the attempt to find paradise at the end of escape.”Wrong Way Up” oscillates between electronic sounds and melodies as it unfolds an “inner journey.” ““The Beach’’ depicts the ““collapse of a community’’ in the depths of a tropical landscape.Paradise is no longer a place, but a projection of the mind.

      <description>Prologue: Organic in the inorganic
Text: mmr | Theme: Autechre by Sean Booth and Rob Brown. Tracing the evolution of its acoustic structure, technological innovation, and cultural-historical significance
Autechre is more than just an electronic music duo.Their sound is both mathematical and raw. It looks cold and leaves a somewhat human roughness. Sean Booth and Rob Brown, two young men who met in north Manchester, set out on a path to redefining the very structure of sound, using hip-hop and engineering curiosity as starting points.
In the early 1990s, Autechre stood out in Warp Records’ Artificial Intelligence series. They were searching for a way to ““convert mechanical sounds into emotion.’’ Sean Booth later said in an interview:

  “Techno for us is not about eliminating emotion, but expressing it through structure.”

      <description>The Rebellion Begins at Leeds Art School
Text: mmr｜Theme: From Leeds punk to the American wilderness. The Mekons’ 45-year history of music and community

  “It started with laughter, not rebellion.”
1977, University of Leeds, Northern England.The Mekons were started by students in a corner of a lecture room, jokingly thinking, ““Maybe we could form a band ourselves.’’ Jon Langford, Tom Greenhalgh, Kevin Lycett, and others would become symbols of the post-punk culture. They had no musical skills and even borrowed instruments.At that time, punk was a revolution that anyone could start. The name Mekons is said to come from the “rebel” character in Byron’s play The Curse of Minerva.
The single ““Where Were You / I’ll Have To Dance Then (On My Own)’’, released in 1978, symbolizes their early punk spirit.”“Where Were You?’’ depicts the loneliness of young people and their doubts about society with sharp guitar riffs and vocals mixed with noise. The B-side, I’ll Have To Dance Then (On My Own), expresses self-alienation and the desire for freedom with punk energy.Although the recording is rough, it is full of improvisation with friends from university, and you can see the origins of the ““aesthetics of imperfection’’ that Mekons later pursued.
Along with their early single ““Never Been in a Riot,’’ this single is considered an important piece of Mekons’ early trinity of social criticism, humor, and self-exploration.At live shows at the time, it was a common sight for the audience to laugh, get confused, and sometimes get into arguments every time this song ended.

      <description>Prologue: The dawn of Brazilian psychedelics
Text: mmr | Theme: Tracing the genealogy of psychedelic music born in Brazil, from the Tropicália movement to modern revival
In the late 1960s, political tensions and cultural experimentation coexisted in a strange way in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. While speech was increasingly controlled under the military regime, young people were inspired by British and American rock and sought new sonic freedom. At the forefront of this movement was the Tropicália movement.
Along with the poet Torcato Neto and the artist Hélio Oiticica, the musical leaders were Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. With the goal of “redefining Brazilian music,” they freely fused bossa nova, samba, folklore, and rock.

  “Tropicália is the tropics in our souls.”&amp;gt; — Caetano Veloso, 1968
In the studios of the time, ““manual overdubbing’’ was repeated, taking advantage of the limitations of recording equipment. ““Psychedelic sound technology’’ was born, including physically cutting and pasting reel-type tape and rotating the tape backwards to create reverse echoes.

      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Introduction: Why “krautrock”?
Text: mmr｜Theme: Krautrock is an important trend that deeply influenced later generations of music such as experimental music, electronic music, post-rock, and techno that originated in Germany.
“Krautrock”——. It was originally a derogatory name given by a British music magazine.”Sauerkraut” is a slang term for Germans.However, young people in the late 1960s reversed that label and used it as a banner for creating their own music.
Postwar Germany. Memories of defeat, the flood of American and British culture, and the emptiness of not having a voice.Krautrock was born out of this “nothingness.”It is not just a musical movement, but a reconstruction of the post-war generation’s identity.Eventually, it became a “philosophical movement of sound” that reinvented the history of rock.

      <description>Noise = Aesthetics: Converting sounds that are considered harsh to the ear into “pleasure” and “art”.
Text: mmr | Theme: Rebellion and destruction - a challenge to existing music and social order.
“Noise” is not simply “noise,” but refers to a field of expression that deviates from established musical idioms (melody, harmony, rhythm) and emphasizes the sound itself, texture, physical impact, and auditory stimulation. Born from a combination of artistic, technological, and social backgrounds, it has continued to change shape for over 100 years.

1) Pioneer (1910s–1940s): Futurism and tape experiments — conceptualization of “noise”### Historical backgroundA time when industrialization and urbanization made the noise of the city crowds and machinery commonplace. The ““aesthetic sense’’ of sound expanded, and sounds other than traditional musical instruments began to be incorporated into art.
Important events/people- In 1913, Italian avant-garde artist Luigi Russolo published ““The Art of Noises’’.

Text: mmr｜Theme: Changes in the Eurorack modular synthesizer and its influence on the music scene
The Eurorack modular synthesizer was invented by German engineer Dieter Doepfer in the early 1990s. Starting from his A-100 system, by standardizing module sizes and power supply standards, a system was born that allowed modules from different manufacturers to be freely combined.
Smaller and more affordable than the traditional Moog and Bucla, Eurorack has gained the support of many musicians and enthusiasts, and has now developed into a large ecosystem with over 300 manufacturers participating around the world.

      <description>“The sound of the future born from a devastated city”
Text: mmr | Theme: Detroit Techno is a cultural product that combines urban history, technology, and Black American creativity.
Detroit techno is ““electronic music with a human touch’’ that was born from the intersection of urban industrial sounds, black American dance culture, and European electronic music. In this column, we will comprehensively introduce the history of its origin, the characteristics of its sound, its main characters and representative songs, its social background, its spread around the world, and its influence to this day.


Origins and Definition — When and Who Called it “Techno”?
In Detroit in the early 1980s, electronic dance music that made full use of synths and rhythm machines grew.
Led by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (not the so-called “Berlin trio” but the “Detroit trio”), they presented a sonic aesthetic that was different from the existing “electro” and “house,” and it became established as “techno.”
The release of the 1988 compilation “Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit” (https://amzn.to/4q9NMVF) played a decisive role in the spread of the genre name.

      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>“Musical characteristics and Japanese sensibilities”
Text: mmr｜Theme: The relationship between Happy Hardcore and Japanese culture
Happy Hardcore emerged from the British rave scene in the early 1990s.The music, which combines pop and emotional melodies with explosively fast beats of around 170 BPM, took Europe by storm, and then unexpectedly connected with Japanese culture, achieving a unique development.The affinity between this “happy” sound and “Japanese culture” is not just an import of musical genres, but a new cultural hybrid.


What is Happy Hardcore?
Derived from British rave/hardcore techno in the early 1990s.
Characteristics: High tempo of around 170BPM, pop and melodic synth, anime/cartoon sampling.
As the name suggests, this genre is a combination of “Happy” and “Hardcore”.


Relevance to Japanese culture
Affinity with anime/game music
Happy Hardcore emphasizes bright and catchy melodies, so it goes well with the taste of anime songs and game music.
In particular, the use of voice material from bishoujo anime and Famicom/SNES-style chiptunes are popular with overseas producers.
Example: In the Anime Rave/J-Core scene, anime lines and melodies are sampled to make it happy hardcore.
Connection with J-Core
Since the 2000s, Japan’s unique “J-Core” scene has emerged.
Based on happy hardcore, fused with otaku culture (anime, doujin, Akihabara club culture).
DJ Sharpnel and m1dy are internationally known.
Overseas fans recognize the formula of “Happy Hardcore + Anime” as “Japanese” and support it as a re-import.
Dance game culture (BEMANI/DDR)
Many happy hardcore songs are included in Konami’s Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and beatmania IIDX series.
As a result, game center culture other than clubs in Japan has spread to young people.
For example: DDR songs by Naoki, Ryu☆, DJ Shimamura and others have a great influence on Happy Hardcore fans overseas.
Festivals and doujin sales
Unlike rave in the UK, the scene in Japan is centered around M3 (sound/media mix doujin sales) and Akihabara-style club events.
“Derivative music distribution” and “doujin CD culture” uniquely supported the distribution and development of Happy Hardcore.


Cultural keywords

  Kawaii: Japanese ““cute culture’’ is reflected in the fast, pop melody.
  Otaku culture: Directly connected to anime, doujinshi, and Akihabara club culture.
  Game culture: DDR and music games made happy hardcore more familiar.
  Reimportation phenomenon: A genre that originated in the UK develops independently in Japan and once again influences the world.



Representative Japanese happy hardcore/J-Core artists

  DJ Shimamura – Representative of Japanese happy hardcore.
  DJ Sharpnel – Highly praised as “J-Core” overseas.
  Ryu☆ / kors k – Main creator of BEMANI scene.
  P＊Light / REDALiCE – Popular producer of Akihabara club culture.



The unique role of Japanese culture in global music history
Happy Hardcore originally came from British rave, but it merged with Japanese culture (anime, games, doujins, music games) to form a unique “J-Core” culture.Today, it is recognized as being associated with “Happy Hardcore = anime-like cuteness,” and Japan has become an important base internationally.

      <description>“Music comes from the margins of society”
Text: mmr｜Theme: Long-read column that connects subculture research and the temperature of the field
“Music comes from the margins of society.” This phrase is old, but it doesn’t miss the point. The sense of urgency, anti-normativity, and communal passion that comes from marginality is often visualized as an “outlaw,” and crystallizes in the form of sound, use of space, fashion, and body techniques. In this article, we trace the major genres/scenes from the 1950s onwards by age, and look at the intersection of “music and outlaws” through the lens of sociology and cultural studies (Hebdidge, Cohen, Beaudrieu, Becker, etc.).


1950s: Bebop ~ Rockabilly – Aesthetics of the periphery and manners of “non-conformity”
The late modernization of jazz (bebop to hard bop) was associated with late-night clubs, drugs, and the black bohemian lifestyle, forming an image of an intellectual outlaw that deviated from postwar norms centered on “work and discipline.”

      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>From “music to listen to” to “music to feel”
Text: mmr｜Theme: Ambient, environmental music, electronic music culture theory
Ambient is a genre of music that is not intended to be “actively listened to” by listeners, but rather to “exist in a space.” He eliminates clear melodies and rhythms and instead uses sustained sounds (drones), environmental sounds (field recordings), and acoustic processing to construct auditory landscapes.
This genre is extremely philosophical music that stands on the border between music and art, sound and space, perception and consciousness.

      <description>Definition of punk and hardcore ─ The crossroads of anger and expression
Text: mmr｜Theme: Punk/Hardcore
In the late 1970s, young people felt oversaturated with commercialized rock music, and ““music that is simple, rough, and above all, expresses its true feelings’’ was born. It’s punk. However, even this punk style eventually began to turn inward, sometimes formally. It was hardcore punk that once again unleashed the flames of anger.In this column, we will delve into the definitions and differences between punk and hardcore from the perspectives of music, ideology, fashion, and history.

      <link>https://monumental-movement.jp/en/Nightmares-On-Wax-Smokers-Delight/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Nightmares On Wax’s Smokers Delight (1995), the second album from British producer George Evelyn’s project, was released on Warp Records and cemented its place in downtempo and trip-hop history. This album remains a timeless masterpiece, transporting listeners to a soothing chill-out realm, a step removed from the hustle and bustle of club culture.
First of all, the core of “Smokers Delight” lies in its “relaxed groove.” The album opens with “Nights Introlude,” featuring soft strings and a gentle beat that samples Quincy Jones’ “Summer In The City,” instantly drawing the listener into a relaxing space.
Musically, the hip-hop skeleton is woven with the essence of reggae, soul, and funk, giving it a unique eclecticism. For example, in “Groove St.,” a deep piano bass line intertwines with a smooth bassline, and the addition of light drums creates a simple yet addictive loop. Meanwhile, longer tracks like ““Pipes Honor,’’ which clock in at over nine minutes, gradually develop layers of guitar and keyboard, taking the listener on a meditative journey.
The production background is also interesting. After the departure of her partner Kevin Harper, Evelyn redefined Nightmares On Wax as a solo project and found a new direction with Smokers Delight. Using analog equipment and sampling techniques, this record embodies the DIY spirit of the ’90s and resonates with the innovative attitude of the Warp label at the time. Robin Taylor-Firth’s keyboard participation and the loops of hand-played instruments scattered throughout create an exquisite fusion of digital and analog, creating a human sound that transcends artificial coldness.

      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Mike &amp;amp; Rich’s “Expert Knob Twiddlers” (1996) is a collaborative album by Richard D. James, aka Aphex Twin, and Mike Paradinas, aka µ-Ziq, two geniuses who led the electronic music scene in the 90s.
The song was created over a few days during the 1994 World Cup and is said to have been born out of a drunken jam session. This background creates a light and free-spirited atmosphere in the music.
Described by Paradinas as “an updated version of easy listening and funk,” melodies reminiscent of 70s lounge music and elevator music are fused with distorted beats and the whimsical tones of analog synths.
These tracks are the result of a fusion of Aphex Twin’s unpredictable experimentalism and µ-Ziq’s melodic structure, creating a sonic adventure that goes beyond mere “written music”.

His first project was L&amp;amp;O’s “Even Now”, but his name is not listed in the credits, and he went on to form his first collaborative project, The Beat Machine, with Patrick de Mayer.
His name became widely known through his duo Quadroponia with Lucien Foort.
Meanwhile, T99 was initially a solo project of Patrick De Meyer, and after releasing three albums, Patrick De Meyer heard that Olivier Abbeloos was working on a song called “Anasthasia” and suggested that they release it under the T99 name.
Olivier Abbeloos agreed, and T99 started working as a duo.
The two later released their only album, “Children Of Chaos”.
As a side note, Abrilos’ brother-in-law is Olivier Pieters, who also worked in the import department of the record shop Target Records.

      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Noisia is a Dutch drum and bass trio that disbanded in 2022. He produces a wide range of music including drum’n’bass, house, breaks, and electronic sounds, and in 2014 he also worked on the remix of LOST CHILD, which was included in Momoiro Clover Z’s “Furious Space Symphony - 7th Movement ‘Infinite Love’ (Emperor Style)”.
“Yellow Brick / Raar” is a breakout house track released in 2007 by Noisia’s own label, Division Recordings.
‘Yellow Brick’ is an addictive, uplifting track with a familiar noisy bassline and a very soothing and simple beat.
‘Raar’, on the other hand, is a track that will absolutely destroy the dance floor.
Where “Yellow Brick” was subdued with a simple beat and tempo, “Raar” feels like you’re getting hit in the head with a sinister bass and a crazy beat that feels intentionally off.
This is a must-hear record for all noise fans, even if you don’t like house music.

      <description>Samuel L is a Swedish tribal techno DJ and producer. “Day n’ Night” is a techno track released in 2001 from SSL, which he runs.
The song “Merengue” was remixed by Slam and Oliver Ho in 2002 and became a club hit.
This track represents the changes in the techno scene since the release of the Detroit techno anthem “Knights Of The Jaguar” in 1999, embodying the typical sound of Detroit techno, characterized by powerful bass lines, hard beats, and psychedelic elements.
Needless to say, the success of “Knights Of The Jaguar” had a huge impact on the techno scene, and many artists began pursuing harder and more aggressive sounds, leading techno to evolve into more experimental and avant-garde music.
Samuel L’s ““Day n’ Night’’ is a representative work of techno sound after the groundbreaking ““Knights Of The Jaguar’’, which was a turning point in the techno scene, and also had a great influence.
Among the techno tracks from 2001, it’s a techno sound right after the millennium, with funky elements intertwined with a straight beat, a pleasant bass drum, no breaks or vocals, just music playing.
This record is a great track that will definitely make any techno lover’s day out.

      <description>“Condor To Mallorca” by Jeff Mills, as the title suggests, is a track with a mystical trip feel, starting with inspired keyboard sounds backed by a calypso-like rhythm program that converges with a kick drum.
The track then takes on a more ominous aspect when the string elements come in.
This EP is a very strong opener with its disturbing musical themes, and “Time After Space” has a cosmic feel.
“Detached” is probably one of his best works.
“Black Avenger” draws listeners in with its percussive frenzy and hard keys.
A must-have for any Jeff Mills fan, this is a special record that covers many of the wide-ranging themes of Jeff Mills’ work, while still expressing the unique and powerful results of each individual song.

      <description>Stock, Hausen &amp;amp; Walkman (Stock, Hausen &amp;amp; Walkman) is a UK sampling collage music unit representing the 90s.
The band’s name, Stock, Hausen &amp;amp; Walkman (1991-2001), is a play on electronic music pioneer Karlheinz Stockhausen, ’80s mass-produced pop artist Stock Aitken Waterman, and Sony’s Walkman.
When they first formed in the late 1980s, they were an experimental improvisational duo consisting of Matt Wand (the band’s godfather and founder) and guitarist Rex Caswell.
During their activities, cellist Dan Weaver and drummers Richard Harrison and Andrew Sharpley participated in live performances and in the studio.
In 1990, he also appeared on ““Company Week’’ at the request of Derek Bailey.
Even after Caswell moved to Denmark and Weaver took a break from recording due to dance and theater work, Wand continued to work and produced perhaps their most successful albums, Organ Transplants vol. 1 &amp;amp; 2. Sharpley also contributed musically.
Wand founded and operated Hot Air Records to promote S,H&amp;amp;W records, and released a wide range of their own work as well as that of other artists on the label.
Currently, he continues to operate the label and plans, designs, and produces albums.
Although the project ended in 2001, Wand continues to release “interesting” S, H&amp;amp;W archival material on Hot Air.

      <description>While many Moving Shadow releases from 1996 to 1997 leaned too heavily into jazzy tunes, this release from Aquasky proved that gentle drum &amp;amp; bass doesn’t have to be boring.
Nylon Roadster is a smooth track, with a subdued breakbeat that doesn’t interfere too much. The heart of this track is the gentle and very emotional piano section in the middle.
I can imagine it being used perfectly as a lullaby. It’s a really great song.

      <description>“Cosmik” has a light rhythm with a nice key break and a slightly jazzy, futuristic sound. It’s not too heavy, and there’s no amen break used here, but it’s a solid track overall. It was also included on Bukem’s first Progression Sessions CD.
“Loop Progression” is another great track, starting with a tough, driving beat before gradually emerging as softer keys combine with the chords. A break follows, followed by a huge, truly huge Amen kick and a cosmic style sound, with the bass kicking in for good measure as well. The great part goes through some bridges and chords, followed by an outro beat followed by a heavy amen beat.

      <description>“Puppy Phat” from “Lo-Fidelity Allstars - Disco Machine Gun” blurs the line between trip-hop and big beat with its downtempo tempo but thick beat and sleazy bassline. Hidden as a B-side, this song is one of Lo-Fi’s best tracks.

      <description>This is a track that every drum &amp;amp; bass fan will love. What no one understood was how the song’s “Reese” sound, a whirring synthesizer sound, was created. It was probably processed by the E-MU sampler’s Z-plane filter.
This Reese sound was used on a variety of tracks, including “Nasty Ways,” “Take My Life,” “Love Is Not a Game Remix,” and “Bambaata Remix,” and variations of it were also used on “Tudor Rose” and “Go Dillinja.”
It’s no exaggeration to say that this Reese sound is probably the coolest drum &amp;amp; bass sound ever created. And it seems crazy to think that back in 1998, during the airwaves of Britpop, someone like Dillinja was underground, completely unconcerned about selling records, and was producing cooler stuff.

      <description>“LSD Is The Bomb” is a great approach to the ‘91 European techno sound, combining aggressive Belgian riffs with sharper, more precise German rhythms.
Many North American artists use plenty of vocal samples, but “LSD Is The Bomb” keeps them from becoming too cheap.
Additionally, this track has the most devastating key change in the middle. It’s truly diabolical.
Definitely worth checking out for fans of the old school rave sound of ‘90-‘92.

      <description>Released in 2005, this album is a classic among Warp releases.
From the swinging, outer-space groove of “Optigan” to the spinning amusement park atmosphere of “Carousel,” Harmonic 33 packs as much mood as possible into a short space of time.
Easy listening flows smoothly, like “Bossa Nova Supernova” and “Departure Lounge.”
On the other hand, if you’re looking for outright eccentricity, listen to “Funky Duck.”
If you like spy dramas, we have ““Paranoia’’ and ““Long Shadow.’’
Even in short songs like “Marionette,” the album still makes its presence felt, and the album ends with the thoughtful and melancholic “Planet 54.”

      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>Obi, Charlie Hall’s “Dreamtech” is a very rare record. A1 and B1 are truly genre-less tracks, both containing elements of broken beat/leftfield/dub, with African vocals/chants creating a tribal 90’s mood.
Percussion and moving synth lines complete this excellent After Hours gem. It’s like something you’d hear in the chill-out rooms of many 90s nightclubs.
B2 is a completely magical and hypnotic tribal broken beat deep house masterpiece. This record uses samples and vocals typical of the era, and has a wonderful mystical mood.
This record is truly a digger’s dream, and it’s rare to find something like this in the 12-inch records you’re looking for. This is definitely a record that deserves more attention.
