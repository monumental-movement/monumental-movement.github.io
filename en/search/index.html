Introduction: The 1990s PC music scene and the emergence of BuzzText: mmr｜Theme: Trace the technical characteristics and history of Buzz, then organize what was possible from the user/community perspective, and trace specific examples of artists’ usage and its musical influence.In the mid-1990s, the world of electronic music/PC music production was at a major turning point. Traditionally, hardware synthesizers, dedicated equipment, and recording studios were the main focus, limiting the environment in which individuals could freely produce and present songs. However, advances in PC (Windows) and software technology have ushered in an era in which people can freely create sounds at home.Meanwhile, “Jeskola Buzz” by Finnish developer Oskari Tammelin appeared around 1997 (or is said to have had an alpha version before then).Buzz is a freeware (free distribution) modular tracker/sequencer for Windows that has been supported by many users. The biggest attraction was the environment in which ““sound sources (generators), effects (machines), and routing (wiring) could be freely assembled to recreate ““modular equipment” on software.”This ““modular + tracker” configuration, unlike the GUI-centered DAWs (digital audio workstations) of the time, allowed for ““experimentalism” and a ““patch-like” approach, giving rise to a high degree of freedom in sonic exploration. Buzz has gone..."

The nightscape of the city and the sounds that reflect nostalgia are now a cultural phenomenon that resonates around the world. At the end of the 1980s, the term ““city pop’’ seemed to have ceased to exist in the Japanese music world.However, in the 2020s, this genre is making waves on streaming charts around the world. “Plastic Love” has been played tens of millions of times on YouTube, and playlists such as “Tokyo Night Drive” and “Japanese City Pop” consistently remain at the top of Spotify.This phenomenon is not just nostalgia. Behind this rediscovery led by chance by an algorithm lies a universal desire for music that coexists with urban sophistication and nostalgia.For young listeners overseas, these sounds are a symbol of ““retro-future.’’ Neon lights, the pavement after the rain, the warmth of analog recordings - they see the romance of the future in the “foreign past” that cannot be found in their own country’s music.DJ Night Tempo said, “This music is nostalgia for the future.” In other words, rather than consuming the past, we..."

You can’t save the lines the player draws at the moment.”— Don BuchlaChapter 1: Don Buchla and the “Anti-Moog” PhilosophyIn the early 1960s, two major trends in the development of electronic musical instruments arose in East and West America.Moog in the east and Buchla in the west.Buchla aimed to “generate” sound rather than “control” it.A touch plate was used instead of a keyboard, and the focus of performance was on rate of change and contingency rather than pitch.His philosophy was carried over into the later Music Easel.Easel is an instrument for humans to perform with electronic circuits, and what exists there is the attitude of a ““co-author” rather than a ““performer = controller.”Technical analysis: Relationship between waveform and tactile sensationBuchla thought that “waveform manipulation..."

For him, sound is both a “measurable natural phenomenon” and the “uncontrollable breath of life.”2. Science of structure - Elaenia period (2015)His debut album ““Elaenia’’ is a turning point in the scientific reorganization of the context of ambient jazz.The sound consists of modular synthesizer waveforms, Rhodes overtones, and string reverberations layered together to create a frequency dialogue.This dialogue is more like ““resonance as a physical phenomenon’’ like wave interference than improvisation. “Silhouettes (I, II &amp; III)” is a 10 minute sonic experiment,Synth LFO (low frequency vibration) and drummer Leo Taylor’s rhythmRepeat synchronization and desynchronization as frequencies of different periods.There is a moment here where “human rhythm” and “machine cycle” intersect.It”s..."

From the early days of hip-hop in the late ’70s to today’s electronica, a single drum break, bassline, or scream has been transformed into hundreds or thousands of songs.1. The Winstons – “Amen, Brother” (1969)Commonly known as “Amen Break”. The six-second drum solo spawned countless genres, including hip-hop, jungle, drum and bass, and hardcore techno. Producers everywhere from N.W.A. and Public Enemy to Aphex Twin and The Prodigy carved out this break.Former drummer Gregory Coleman passed away without a reward, but the ““spirit of the groove’’ that dwells between the snare and the hi-hat continues to resonate.2. Lyn Collins – “Think (About It)” (1972)Produced by James Brown. A woman”s powerful shout and “Woo! Yeah!” break symbolize the golden age of hip-hop.

In his hands, a huge number of session tapes were cut and pasted and reassembled, resulting in a group of works that can be called ““composition by editing’’.““In a Silent Way” (1969) and ““Bitches Brew” (1970) are prime examples. There is a revolution in editing aesthetics that goes beyond the boundaries between ““performance” and ““composition”.Chapter 1: The birth of an editor named Teo MaceroTeo Macero was born in 1925 in Glens Falls, New York. He began his career as a jazz saxophonist and later studied composition at Columbia University, where he became familiar with avant-garde contemporary music.Like Stockhausen and Varèse, Macero developed an early awareness of treating sound as a material.In the late 1950s, he became a staff producer..."

Here we explore the philosophical intersection of his work and forest bathing (Shinrin-yoku). Recondite――real name Lorenz Brunner.When many people hear his music for the first time, they feel a sense of ““loneliness” and ““tranquility.”However, deep down, there is a tension between nature and technology.For Brunner, who grew up in the Bavarian forests of southern Germany, sound is not a product of the city;It was an organic thing born out of fog and humidity, wind and shadow.In recent years, the term ““forest bathing’’ (Shinrin-yoku) has been attracting worldwide attention, even in Japan.It is not just healing, but the act of reconnecting human senses to the natural environment.This concept and Recondite’s sonic world are strangely intimate.His minimal tracks are like walking through a digital forest.Chapter 1: The phenomenon called ReconditeSince their debut in 2011, Recondite has carved out a unique position in the progressive techno scene.While distancing himself from Berlin’s club culture, he combined solitude and nature motifs.Representative works: “On Acid” (2012) — Reconstructing the acid sound of Roland TB-303 in humid..."

In 1978, an unusual band appeared in the port city of Bristol in southwestern England.Its name is The Pop Group.Although they called themselves pop, their music was not funk, punk, or jazz, but rather an experiment in which all genres collided explosively.Their sound evokes the unemployment, class, political corruption, and alienation of young people that covered England in the 1970s.It was sublimated as a “scream” of the sound itself.It wasn’t just music, it was ““anti-establishment physical expression” and ““an art that brings together fragments of ideas.”The city of Bristol is a port city with a history of slave trade and a multicultural mix.The musical movement born here was also the birthplace of the trip-hop culture that would eventually lead to Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky.The Pop Group was the origin and first “voice of rebellion”.Chapter 1: The birth of the city of Bristol (1970–1977)Bristol in the 1970s was an..."

The person who has continued to stand at the center of this is Masami Akita (Merzbow).

In other words, the very act of dismantling existing structures and reconstructing the fragments is his creative principle.Akita has been active for over 40 years, but his philosophy has always been ““the politics of listening’’.

There are approximately 1,000 cases of crop damage per year, and human damage has approximately doubled in the past 10 years (Ministry of the Environment’s ““Wild Animal Damage Statistics 2024’’). The physical measures taken so far are not sufficient, and sustainable damage control methods are required.What is attracting attention is the ““control of bear behavior through sound.’’ Bears have a well-developed sense of hearing and are sensitive to human voices, warning sounds, and artificial sounds at specific frequencies. In recent years, an increasing number of demonstration experiments have been conducted by farmers, local governments, and research institutions, expanding the possibilities of sound management based on scientific evidence.2.

Don Buchler: Poetics of Electronic Sound1-1. From San Francisco Tape Music CenterAt San Francisco’s Tape Music Center in the early 1960s, artists like Morton Subotnick and Pauline Oliveros were exploring new relationships between experimental music and technology.What they were looking for was ““an instrument that was not an extension of the piano or guitar.’’The Buchla Series 100 (1963–1966) appeared in response to Subotnick’s request.Traditional musical operability was intentionally avoided, such as the acoustic circuit configuration using knobs and patch cables, and the touch plate keyboard..."

James (Aphex Twin) emerged as someone who completely turned the existing grammar of genres like techno and ambient on its head. His early works are sound experiments in which mechanical dreams and human illusions intertwine, and his current sound lies between an artificial intelligence structure and a return to nostalgia.Below, we will compare and examine these “changes” and “unchanges” from the four axes of work, technology, aesthetics, and ideology.I. The world of early Aphex Twin: electronic poetics and analog violence1.1 “Selected Ambient Works” - Introspective electronic dreams1992’s Selected Ambient Works 85–92 was a turning point in the history of electronic music.The monotonous rhythm of a sequencer and the soft fluctuations of an analog synth.What you can hear inside is ““human breathing’’ on the other side of the electrons.Rather than ““composing” sounds, Richard composed ““environments.”A strange sound image that is ambient yet has the intensity of a club.It was an extension of Brian Eno, but with a more personal and destructive emotion. “For me, ambient is..."

Considering the reconstruction of the relationship between humans and the world as told by music without sound When John Cage”s ““4”33’’ premiered in New York in 1952, audiences were perplexed and agitated.The pianist doesn’t play a single note. However, the venue was filled with sounds: coughs, chairs creaking, and the wind outside.At that moment, it became clear that music is not just composed sounds, but the act of listening itself.Cage speaks. “There is no silence. Everything is sound.”This philosophy greatly expanded the realm of music and was passed on to 21st century sound art, field recording, and ambient music.Chapter 1: What is listening to sound? — Listening as sensory retrainingWe do too much “unconscious listening” in our daily lives.Smartphone notification sounds, subway announcements, street noises.They recede into the background of consciousness and become just a piece of information.However, Cage and the composers of musique concrète encouraged us to practice rediscovering listening.Listening is an act of renewing one’s relationship with the world,It is an attitude of accepting ““the sounds that already..."

A solitary artist who explores the soul of sound at the border between club culture and ambient. Tracing its tranquility and cosmic natureIn the early 1990s, Japan’s electronic music scene was still in its infancy. While techno and house were becoming popular as imported culture, ambient music, which focused on “environmental sounds” and “silence,” was still a minority experimental genre.Susumu Yokota was a poet who lived in this quiet space. His music is an extension of club culture, yet somehow ““outside’’ it. He was a rare artist who used electronic particles to depict the breath of nature, the distance of the wind, and the reverberations of memories.Although Yokota started out in Tokyo’s club scene, he quickly transcended that context. His music focused more on “pause” than the “rhythm” of dance music, and moved toward pursuing the tranquility and organicity of electronic music. This is similar to the Japanese sense of ““wabi-sabi’’.Chapter 2: Susumu Yokota as a writer — Poetry of soundscapeYokota’s early works are heavily influenced by acid house.Acid Mt. Fuji (1994) was a groundbreaking work that fused natural sounds and acid synth. A paradoxical structure in..."

The moment your fingers touch the strings, the sound is generated from the vibrations of your fingers and reaches the world through amplifiers and effectors. The tone produced by a guitar acts like a mirror, reflecting a person’s emotions, mental state, and even cultural background.The image of a guitarist is different between Japan and the world. In the United States and the United Kingdom, blues and rock have become the foundation, and the genre has evolved into a mainstream one. However, Japan has experienced a more complex and free-flowing development, from the postwar electric boom to underground noise, improvisation, and post-rock. The uniqueness of Japanese guitars emerges at the intersection of mainstream technique and underground destructive expression.II. World Edition: The moment when the guitar started a revolution1.

In the early 1980s, Chicago’s club scene was experiencing a lull due to the decline of disco.As disco grew commercially and disappeared from radio and the mainstream, young people were looking for a new outlet for musical expression. One of the answers was the music that later became known as ““Chicago House.’’The Warehouse club was a musical testing ground during this period. In a vast warehouse-like space, members of the black community, LGBTQ+ community, and urban youth gathered to immerse themselves in music.

If we look at the history of records, we can see how this “intermediate format” marked a turning point in the times.10 inches is not just a matter of size. It was also another philosophy that redefined ““length of time” and ““density of sound.” The restriction of around 10 minutes per side forced artists and engineers to choose ““condensation,’’ and the result was a surprisingly well-defined sound and a listening experience that required concentration.“Just long enough to take a drink by the time you finish listening.”The aesthetics of 10 inches resides in this sense of time.10-inch as a history of technology: Balance of rotation speed, groove width, and sound qualityThe appeal of the 10-inch cannot be explained simply by being “in between the sizes.”It is built on an exquisite balance both physically and acoustically.Born in the early 1950s..."

Cunningham’s method consists in ““deconstruction of pop songs” and ““using the studio as part of the songwriting process.” Creating a sense of discomfort with simple riffs and catchy melodies through artificially awkward performances, mechanical processing, and tape collages—this is the essence of his “humorous experiments.” As a result, we have created a unique sound image that sits diagonally above the post-punk/new wave context.Who is David Cunningham?David Cunningham (1954–) is a producer/composer known as the man behind The Flying Lizards.As a bridge between experimental music and pop culture, they left a unique mark on the post-punk scene of the late 1970s.

The melodies are simple, often with long sustained notes and repeated structures, and the rhythms are often purposely omitted or very slow.For this reason, it played a role as “healing music” and was associated with spiritual lifestyles and back-to-nature movements.Origin and historical background1970s: With the rise of interest in New Age thought and Eastern philosophy, it spread among people who wanted to meditate and return to nature. Krautrock (Tangerine Dream, Popol Vuh, etc.) and the ambient works of Brian Eno became the soil.1980s: Labels such as Windham Hill Records and Private Music were established, and artists such as George Winston and Kitaro gained worldwide popularity.

Amidst the chaos that followed the end of the Cold War, it served as the most important center for connecting Detroit techno and Berlin”s underground culture, and continues to maintain its international influence to this day.Background of its birth: Berlin and the post-Cold War vacuumIn 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. Spaces that were once controlled by the state have turned into ““lawless zones’’ and become testing grounds for underground youth culture.Abandoned buildings, disused factories, and underground spaces have been turned into clubs.Western and Eastern cultures fused, and dance music, a symbol of freedom, resonated.Among them, Tresor opened in a renovated vault of a former department store.

Acid jazz emerged as ““danceable jazz” and ““soulful music suitable for clubs.”Musical featuresAcid jazz tends to refer to a ““hybrid feeling’’ rather than a single genre.

The name comes from the fact that the music is composed of a physical dance groove and electronics. This can be described as a fusion of industrial music and electronic dance music.In particular, the following two groups are known as pioneers: Front 242 (Belgium) DAF (Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, Germany) By making full use of cold, sharp electronics, violent minimal beats, and militaristic vocals, they created a new kind of “physical electronic music” that differs from conventional pop and rock.Sound characteristicsTo put it simply, EBM’s sound is “inorganic and physical.” It features the following elements:Hard and minimal beat Mainly 4/4 time signature, BPM around 120-140 Mechanical rhythm like industrial machinery Heavy use of drum machines (Roland TR-808, TR-909, etc.) Synthesizers and Sequencers Monochrome, dark, heavy synth sound Loop configuration driven by analog/digital sequencer Balancing the trance state and physicality created by repetition Vocal Low, inorganic voices, mostly male voices Speaks in a commanding tone, slogan-like rather than singing.

Originally developed as a bass guitar replacement, the TB-303 was used by DJs and producers (particularly from a unit called Phuture) in unexpected ways, producing undulating, ““liquid” and ““psychedelic” basslines.Phuture’s 1987 single “Acid Tracks” became the prototype for this new style, both in sonic character and name.Sound characteristics: Chemical sound image brought about by TB-303The most important characteristics of acid house are the following sound elements:Baseline with TB-303 Unique “purpy” and “squish” sound Mysterious acoustic changes caused by filter resonance and slide Analog randomness and manual operation organicity Quadruple kick BPM is a stable tempo of around 120-130 Standard combination with drum pattern by TR-808 or TR-909 Minimal structure Trip feeling due to repeated loops Create a sense of ecstasy with long build-ups and detailed changes This sound had a tremendous effect as a ““chemical sound’’ that..."

Generally, the BPM (tempo) is around 60 to 110, and it is characterized by relaxing rhythms and sounds aimed at listening and chilling out, rather than intense beats for clubs.In between the throbbing heartbeat and the hustle and bustle, a sudden silence appears. If it”s music, downtempo is that moment of deep breathing. In the world of club culture and electronic music, it is a music genre that is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the fast beats of techno and house, but it is close to the listener”s emotions and blends into the city night. That’s downtempo.Downtempo is created through the intersection of multiple genres, including the floating feel of ambient, the grooves of hip-hop, and the organic elements of jazz and soul.Although it often overlaps with styles such as chillout, trip hop, and lounge music, it is also used as a general term for a gentle groove that encompasses these styles.90’s Chill Out RevolutionFrom the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the concept of a ““chill-out..."

In this article, we will unravel over time how this film music was recorded, distributed, recorded, and preserved.History of film music and the origins of recording● Silent film period (~1920s)A pianist and an orchestra provided live music at the movie theater. Therefore, ““recorded film music media’’ did not exist in this era. Film music scores have been in circulation, but there are no records of them being used as media.● The advent of talkie films and sound recordings (1927~)Starting with [\"”The Jazz Singer’’ (1927)] (https://amzn.to/3Wn4CTH), Optical Sound was introduced, and we entered an era in which audio information (scores) were recorded on video film.Around this time, the meaning of ““soundtrack = audio material of a movie’’ became clear.●Major media for film music: technological changes..."

In 1978, he wrote the following in his masterpiece [Ambient 1: Music for Airports] (https://amzn.to/48shEpU):“Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.”““Ambient music must not force itself to be heard, but at the same time allow itself to be ignored.’’In other words, ambient music is not background music, but it functions like background music. It is “spatial art” that flows in the background of consciousness.Genealogy and origins of ambient● Prehistory: The germ of environmental musicEric Satie: Composer of the end..."

Britain not only embraced this music, but expanded it from the underground to clubs, raves and venues for sonic experimentation. In this article, we will cover the overall picture of 90s UK techno from the perspectives of culture, music, people, and labels.Fusion of rave culture and undergroundFollowing the ““Second Summer of Love”’ in 1988, the UK was engulfed in an explosion of acid house and rave. In the aftermath, various subspecies of hardcore, breakbeat, and techno grew underground in the early “90s.On the other hand, the end of the Thatcher government and widening economic disparity caused young people’s dissatisfaction and rebelliousness to be imprinted in music. UK techno was not just dance music, it was also a social movement armed with sound systems and illegal raves.Lineage of Innovators● The Black DogA pioneer of Intelligent Techno (IDM).

This album remains a timeless masterpiece, transporting listeners to a soothing chill-out realm, a step removed from the hustle and bustle of club culture.First of all, the core of “Smokers Delight” lies in its “relaxed groove.” The album opens with “Nights Introlude,” featuring soft strings and a gentle beat that samples Quincy Jones’ “Summer In The City,” instantly drawing the listener into a relaxing space.Musically, the hip-hop skeleton is woven with the essence of reggae, soul, and funk, giving it a unique eclecticism. For example, in “Groove St.,” a deep piano bass line intertwines with a smooth bassline, and the addition of light drums creates a simple yet addictive loop. Meanwhile, longer tracks like ““Pipes Honor,’’ which clock in at over nine minutes, gradually develop layers of guitar and keyboard, taking the listener on a meditative journey.The production background is also interesting.
