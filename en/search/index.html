    "body": "Prologue: Shaking beats, bouncing bass—what is UK garage?Text: mmr｜Theme: UK garage nurtured in the underground of London in the 90s. Tracing its birth, transformation, and the intersection of club culture In the mid-1990s, there was a sonic revolution quietly underway in London’s underground clubs. Its name is “UK Garage”. Based on American Garage House, they have established a unique “shuffling rhythm” by combining jungle rhythms, R&amp;B vocals, and Jamaican sound system culture. This new sound was more than just a genre of club music, it served as an expression of urban multiculturalism and immigrant communities. UK garage eventually branched out into 2-Step, Speed ​​Garage, Grime, and Dubstep, becoming the cornerstone of current UK bass culture. Chapter 1: Roots—American Garage and UK ReinterpretationThe origins of UK garage can be traced back to the US Garage House that flourished in the late 1980s, namely the New York deep house produced by Larry Levan and Todd Terry. The sound made its way to the UK, where club DJs, particularly in London, transformed it into a faster, more swinging sound. After ““Second Summer of Love” in 1988, rave culture spread, and in an environment that mixed house, jungle, and breakbeats, a demographic emerged that sought ““music that was soulful but not too hard. ” This later became the breeding ground for UK garage. Chapter 2: Birth of Speed ​​Garage and 2-StepEmergence of Speed ​​Garage (1996-1998)Early UK garages were known as Speed ​​Garage. This is a style of American house with a jungle bassline, and some typical tracks include:  Double 99 – “RipGroove” (1997) Tuff Jam – “Need Good Love” (1997) Armand Van Helden – “Sugar is Sweeter (Remix)” (1996)There is. Speed ​​Garage rocked the club floor with its balance of sub-bass swells and vocal chops. Transition to 2-Step (1998-2000)Gradually, the four-on-one kick was omitted, and the swinging beat became dominant. This was the 2-Step Garage, led by Artful Dodger, MJ Cole, Craig David and others.  Artful Dodger feat. Craig David – “Re-Rewind” (1999) MJ Cole – “Sincere” (2000)These songs, at the intersection of R&amp;B melodies and UK rhythms, dominated the radio and charts. Chapter 3: Clubs and pirate radio—the infrastructure of UKG cultureUK garage wasn’t just music, it was supported by a network of media and club culture. Main clubs Twice As Nice (London): A symbolic club where blacks, whites, and Asians meet.  La Cosa Nostra (Soho): Played by many early 2-Step DJs.  Sidewinder (national tour format): Expanded with MC culture. Pirate Radio Station Rinse FM, Deja Vu FM, Flex FMAlthough these were pirate stations without legal broadcasting rights, they played a decisive role in the spread of UKG. From here, So Solid Crew and Heartless Crew emerged. Chapter 4: Fusion of MC and vocal cultureOne of the important characteristics of UK garage is the coexistence of MC and vocalist. The tradition of ““toasting”’ inherited from Jamaican sound system culture was translated into London”s MC style. Representative MC/crew:  MC Neat &amp; DJ Luck So Solid Crew Ms Dynamite Heartless CrewIn live recordings from this period, MCs would improvise to stir up the crowd, mixing in rap and slang to create a sense of unity in the club. This phenomenon of ““sound and voice becoming one’’ became the foundation for the later birth of Grime. Chapter 5: Early 2000s—Mainstreaming and fragmentationAround 2000, UK garage entered its golden age on the charts. Craig David’s ““Born To Do It” (2000) reached number 1 in the UK, and 2-Step became popular in pop music. However, at the same time, a backlash against ““commercialization” arose. From 2001 to 2003, a more aggressive and dark sound emerged in clubs. This became the starting point for later Grime and Dubstep.       Branch   Features   Representative Artist         Grime   Around BPM140, MC-based hard sound   Wiley, Dizzee Rascal       Dubstep   Emphasis on bass, dark space   Skream, Benga, Digital Mystikz       Bassline   4/4 return, pop vocals   T2, DJ Q   Chapter 6: Social Background——Multi-layered culture of London, a city of immigrantsUK Garage is music developed mainly by young people of black, Caribbean, and Asian descent. It is this diversity that creates the ““fluctuation’’ of the rhythm.  Afro-Caribbean rhythm (derived from jungle and reggae) American R&amp;B melody The DIY spirit of British citiesThis intersection formed the UK’s unique sonic identity. The UKG party was also a common space that transcended class and race, and served as a means of positive expression for young people in response to the social unrest at the time (riots, unemployment, policies under the Blair government). Chapter 7: Succession and Revival—20 Years Since UKGFrom the late 2010s to the 2020s, UK garage will undergo a wave of reappraisal. Disclosure, Burial, Jamie xx and others are reimagining it in a modern way, re-projecting the spirit of UKG into lo-fi and Future Garage.  Burial – “Archangel” (2007) Disclosure – “Latch” (2012) Joy Orbison – “Hyph Mngo” (2009)Furthermore, with the hit Eliza Rose – “B. O. T. A. ” ​​(2022), 2-Step rhythms once again dominated the charts. It has begun to reach young people not only in clubs but also through social networking sites such as TikTok. Chapter 8: A volatile future—What UKG has left behindUK garage transcends genre boundaries and has taken root as the ““urban rhythmic language. ’’Its characteristics of ““bouncing beats,” ““human deviations,” and ““fragments of voices’’ still pulsate throughout UK bass culture. From underground to mainstream and back to underground——The history of UK garage is a cycle of urban music itself.

    "title": "[Column] Steve Jobs and Jonathan Ive - Resonance between sound and design",
    "body": "Prologue: Shaking beats, bouncing bass—what is UK garage?Text: mmr｜Theme: Tracing the changes in the duo’s music views, design philosophy, and product line based on primary materials and reliable testimonies. Among the many products Apple has created, the design surrounding “sound” has always been at the center of it. The collaboration between Steve Jobs and Jonathan Ive goes beyond mere product design. A new culture of fusion of music and technology was born.  “Music is one of the purest forms of expressing who we are. ”— Jonathan Ive (from the podcast “Life in Seven Songs”, 2024) Chapter 1 Records and the California AirSteve Jobs was a product of the California counterculture of the late 1960s and 1970s. His admiration for Bob Dylan and the Beatles from a young age is confirmed by numerous biographies. In Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs” (2011), his living room has a tube amplifier and a record player. It is said that he listened to albums by Bob Dylan and Joan Baez every night.  “Dylan’s words have soul. They are not the sounds of a machine. ”— Steve Jobs (from a 1982 interview) Music was not just a hobby for Jobs, but an art that bridged the gap between humans and machines. Chapter 2 I”ve”s aesthetics and tranquil soundJonathan Ive is from London. After studying industrial design, he joined Apple in 1992. His aesthetic sense is rooted in Bauhaus rationalism, but he also has a deep obsession with sound. In his 2024 podcast, Life in Seven Songs, he shares seven songs that have shaped his life. These include U2”s “40” and The Temptations” “Papa Was a Rollin” Stone”. It is clear that he has a special affinity for the ““thickness” and ““temperature” of analog sounds.  “Music, like products, is an art that creates shapes in space. ”— Jonathan Ive (2024) The company he founded after leaving Apple is LoveFrom. In 2023, the group collaborated with luxury audio brand LINN to redesign an analog turntable. This minimalist and sophisticated product embodies his “respect for sound. ” Chapter 3 Jobs and the Music Revolution - From iTunes to iPodIn 2001, Apple introduced a product that defined the era of digital music. The iPod represents the fusion of both Jobs” and Ive”s aesthetics. Jobs said, ““1000 songs in your pocket. ’’Ive focused on the ““finger tactility’’ of wheel operation. The arrival of the iTunes Store (2003) marked the first revolution in music consumption since the record era. Jobs’ prediction that ““the music industry will be saved by software’’ is coming true.  “Delivering music legally and digitally is the greatest respect for musicians. ”— Steve Jobs (2003) Chapter 4 “Musical Structure” of DesignWhat Jobs and Ive have in common is that they viewed music structurally. Jobs spoke of “repetition and order” like Bach’s fugue,Ive’s core design was to “retain functionality in silence. ” Power Macintosh silhouetteThe Power Mac G4 Cube (2000) designed by Ive looked like a silent speaker. Fanless structure, transparent acrylic exterior, interior light design──The tranquility was the embodiment of “silence in order to listen to sound. ” Chapter 5 Integration of Mac and music productionApple’s machines evolved not just as digital devices, but as tools for music production. The advent of GarageBand (2004) ushered in an era in which anyone could create music. Furthermore, the MacBook Pro (2006-) adopted a resonance design that utilizes the aluminum casing for sound reproduction. Ive says, ““The casing itself shapes the sound’’ (Fast Company interview, 2015). Chapter 6 From records to the cloud - inheritance of sonic memoriesWhen Jobs talked about his iCloud concept, he dreamed of ““a world where music can be played no matter where you are. ’’At its root is the concept of the cloud as an extension of the act of picking up a record and dropping the needle. On the other hand, Ive through LoveFrom,We are pursuing ““tactile sound,’’ which is the opposite of cloud computing. The vectors of these two people seem to be contrasting, butIn fact, they are united by the philosophy of ““setting people free through music. ’’ Chapter 7 Design chronology of the two (relationship between main products and sound)      Year   Products   Main Designer   Sound Features         1998   iMac G3   Jony Ive   Integrated speaker design. Emphasis on “openness” of sound       2000   Power Mac G4 Cube   Jony Ive   Fanless structure, symbol of silence       2001   iPod   Ive + Jobs   “Music in your pocket” revolution       2003   iTunes Store   Jobs   Renovating the music distribution business       2004   GarageBand   Apple   Popularizing music production       2007   iPhone   Ive + Jobs   Music playback device integration       2015   Apple Music   Apple   The turning point to streaming       2023   Linn Sondek LP12 LoveFrom Edition   LoveFrom   Return to analog sound   Chapter 8 The design language of “sound”After Jobs passed away, Ive described him as follows.  “He looked at products the way you listen to music: there”s rhythm, there”s harmony, there’s silence. ” Ive himself calls the design work he continues with LoveFrom a “sound process. ”In other words, design is not only a visual art, but also an act of constructing sound. Chapter 9: Echoes of a quiet revolutionThe “startup sound”, “click sound”, and “silence design” of Apple products areIt was all the result of a sonic collaboration between Jobs and Ive. The philosophy of sound they created remains at the core of music even today in the age of AI. Through music and design, they brought technology back to human sensibilities. Conclusion - Sounds that start with love (LoveFrom)LoveFrom’s official statement reads:  “We are a creative collective. We design for love, not for markets. ” The philosophy of “designing for love” echoes the spirit of Jobs. Just as music breathes soul into technology,Design also continues to play the “sound” of love.

    "title": "[Column] Expanding trajectory of Minimal Music: Aesthetics of repetition and change as seen from Techno, House, and Rock",
    "body": "Prologue: Between silence and repetitionText: mmr｜Theme: “Aesthetics of Repetition and Change”—A cross-sectional interpretation of minimal music, the richest expression of music achieved through “scarcity,” from classical to techno to contemporary Japan. A single sound rings out, then disappears silently. The next sound appears again, at a slightly different angle. By the time that series takes shape, we are listening not to the music’s “story” but to its “existence itself. ”–That was the beginning of minimal music. Minimal music was born in America in the 1960s. Abandoning the drama and emotional expression that traditional Western music has pursued,Instead, it has transformed into an art that allows us to listen to “time and structure” itself. Terry Riley”s “In C”, Steve Reich”s “Piano Phase”,And Philip Glass’s “Einstein on the Beach”——They elevated the repetition of sound to a meditative experience rather than a boring experience. Eventually, this philosophy permeated the world of electronic music. In the constant rhythm of TR-808 and 909,A slight change in the filter or misalignment of the hi-hat gives it life. It”s the same idea as Reich”s “phase shift” on the piano. It is the minute differences within repetition that create the sense of musical time. In this paper, we will explore how this “aesthetics of repetition” can be extended andClassical, techno, house, rock, and even Japanese electronic music. We trace how it became a single sensual and philosophical trend that pervades a variety of genres. Minimalism is not just “striping down. ”It is an act of looking at the ““eternity’’ that resides in the smallest unit of sound. An infinite fluctuation that is born between silence and rhythm. In this environment, people sense “presence” through hearing. Chapter 1: The origins of minimal music - Terry Riley and Steve ReichIn 1964, Terry Riley’s In C premiered. This piece had an unprecedented structure, with the performers freely repeating 53 short note patterns. Each phrase overlaps with a slight shift, creating a sound that seems to continue indefinitely. This ““free repetition’’ is an idea that would later lead to electronic music and DJ culture. Structural analysis       Element   Content         Basic materials   53 phrases (in 1-2 measure units)       Tempo   Any (generally around ♩=120)       Repetition method   Each player moves to the next phrase at their own timing       Effect   Polyrhythm effect due to phase shift   Steve Reich’s next work, Piano Phase (1967), strictly controlled the “discrepancies” in repetition. By having two pianists play the same phrase and one accelerating the tempo slightly,The sound pattern gradually shifts. This “Phase Shifting” is whatIt foresaw the aesthetics of loop structures in later techno. Chapter 2: Philip Glass and the “beauty of construction” – between machines and humansPhilip Glass elevated repetition as ““structural order. ’’The opera Einstein on the Beach (1976) is a five-hour acoustic architecture. While changing the same phrase step by step, the voice, organ, and violin are played. Continuing to draw geometric sound patterns. Characteristics of repetitive structure  Addition/subtraction in module units (Additive Process) Advantage of “pulse” over pitch Fluctuations of emotion based on numerical regularityGlass’s method also influenced post-rock and electronica from the 1980s onwards. For example, the influence of Grass’s ““sustained rhythm’’ can be seen in the compositions of Tortoise and Sigur Rós. Chapter 3: Minimalism in Techno and House - From Detroit to BerlinDetroit Geometric MinimalismMinimal techno was created by Derrick May, Jeff Mills, Robert Hood and others. It was a ““mental construct’’ based on rhythmic abstraction. Robert Hood’s ““Minimal Nation’’ (1994) is played by the TR-909 drum machine. Creating extreme tension from minimal patterns.

Low frequency repetition and reverberation created an acoustic experience that expanded the sense of time. Chapter 4: Rock and Post-Minimalism - From Brian Eno to RadioheadBrian Eno’s Music for Airports (1978)It is not only the father of ambient music, but also the origin of ““static minimalism. ’’The accidental overlapping of loop tapes expanded the auditory timeline. Later, in Radiohead’s ““Everything in Its Right Place’’ (2000),Repeating synths and vocal loops bring a Reichian sense of phase to pop music.

This sense of “electronic persistence” also applies to later techno-ambient music. Ryoji Ikeda: Minimal data and frequencyRyoji Ikeda’s works transform pure frequencies, numbers, and data into music. “dataplex” (2005) repeats and divides ultra-high frequency sounds that test the limits of human perception. The acoustic space was presented as “digital minimalism”.

    "title": "[Column] Dancehall and sound systems—Bass moves the world",
    "body": "Prologue: Revolution starting with bass      Text: mmr   Theme: Dancehall is more than just a music genre, it’s about the philosophy of hope that “everyone can have their own sound. ”   Kingston at midnight. A rumbling bass is emitted from a speaker mounted on the bed of a truck. It was ““another radio’’ that echoed on the streets of poverty. People without newspapers or television can share information and exchange messages through sound. A sound system is an expression device that integrates music, politics, and community. Eventually, the waves would cross the ocean and shake London, New York, and even Tokyo. This column introduces the sound system culture that was born on the streets of Jamaica. How did dancehall evolve into a worldwide musical phenomenon?We will follow it from the perspectives of history, ideology, technology, and society. Chapter 1 Birth of the sound system (1940s-1960s)▪ The moment street parties become “culture”In post-war Jamaica, record store owners and young music lovers loaded up trucks, set up speakers, and started playing music all night. This is the origin of the “sound system”. A typical initial system is:       Operator   Name   Activity period   Characteristics         Tom the Great Sebastian   1950s   Mainly jazz and R&amp;B. The earliest “mobile” systems           Duke Reid   Duke Reid the Trojan   1950s-60s   A famous gun-wielding operator who graduated from the police force. Later founded Treasure Isle       Clement “Coxsone” Dodd   Sir Coxsone Downbeat   1950s~   Former Studio One. Leading the ska era   ▪ Local economy and communityFor the poor, dance is not just entertainment, but a place of expression and survival. This space, where music, alcohol, and food circulated, later became the prototype of the reggae industry. Chapter 2 Roots Rock and Dub Era (1970s)▪ Sound engineers become “composers”King Tubby, Lee Perry, Errol Thompson and others used the mixing table like a musical instrument and invented a new sonic expression called ““dub. ’’Erasing the vocals and reconstructing the rhythm with echoes—This idea became the starting point for later remix culture.  “Dub is the space where the spirit speaks. ” — Lee Perry ▪ Speaker bass philosophyThe “bass” of the sound system had a religious sound. Connected with the Rastafarian spirit, they express their view of the universe as ““low tone = earth” and ““treble tone = heaven”. This idea was later inherited by UK dub (Jah Shaka, Aba Shanti-I) and soundclash culture. Chapter 3 Digital revolution and the emergence of dancehall (1980s-90s)▪ Slackness and slang explosionIn 1985, Wayne Smith’s ““Under Mi Sleng Teng’‘ changed everything. This song, which uses Casio MT-40’s rhythm presets, is said to be the first completely digital reggae in history, and from then on, ““digital dancehall’’ became mainstream.       Year   Representative song   Artist   Notes         1985   Under Mi Sleng Teng   Wayne Smith   World’s first digital riddim       1986   Punanny   Admiral Bailey   Symbol of “Slackness”       1990   Dem Bow   Shabba Ranks   Later to become the basic rhythm of reggaeton   ▪ MC (Deejay) takes center stageToasting culture approached DJ rap and influenced the birth of hip-hop. It is a well-known story that Jamaican Kool Herc brought a sound system to New York’s Bronx and started the breakbeat culture. Chapter 4 Sound Clash and the Deepening of Deejay Culture▪ Clash = Battle of SoundSound Clash is an event where multiple sound systems compete against each other. The difference between winning and losing is how many Original Dub Plate (special recordings) you have and how much you can excite the audience. Representative sounds:  Stone Love Movement (Kingston) Bass Odyssey (St. Ann) Killamanjaro (90s golden era) Mighty Crown (Japan)▪ Japan”s feat: Mighty Crown”s world dominationMighty Crown from Yokohama defeated a Jamaican team to win the 2002 World Clash. It was the moment when the ““foreigner sound’’ reached its peak for the first time. Since then, local sounds have been born all over Japan, and a cultural area called ““Reggae Village’’ has been formed. Chapter 5 Globalizing Dancehall (2000s-2020s)▪ Impact on global popSean Paul, Vybz Kartel, Popcaan and others took the mainstream by storm. In the 2010s, Drake”s ““One Dance” and Major Lazer”s ““Lean On” made dancehall pop. The rhythm pattern “Dem Bow” has been extended to reggaeton, Afrobeats, and K-Pop. ▪ Bass as DiasporaDancehall is also a symbol of immigrant culture. London, Toronto, Tokyo—Black communities in cities around the world have been expressing their roots in low notes. Chapter 6 Sound system culture in Japan and Asia▪ Reggae goes localSince the 1990s, sound culture has taken root in Japan, mainly in Yokohama, Osaka, and Nagoya. Homemade sound systems equipped with giant woofers are appearing one after another at club events and outdoor festivals. Main Japanese players:  Mighty Crown (Yokohama) Sound Platinum, Infinity 16, King Ryukyu, Scorpion Outdoor festivals “Yokohama Reggae Sai”, “Japan Splash”, etc. ▪ DIY spirit and modern inheritanceIn recent years, it has intersected with dubstep/techno. Tokyo Dub Attack, Zettai-Mu (Osaka), Mura Masa System (Okinawa) are currently active. At the root of this is the sound system philosophy of ““producing our own sounds with our own hands. ’’ Timeline: The evolution of sound systems and dancehall      Years   Events   Key Persons         1940s   Birth of sound system culture   Tom the Great Sebastian       1950s   Duke Reid, Coxsone begins   Duke Reid, Coxsone Dodd       1960s   Ska → Rocksteady → Reggae   The Skatalites       1970s   Birth of Dub, penetration of Rasta ideology   King Tubby, Lee Perry       1980s   Digital Revolution, “Sleng Teng”   Wayne Smith       1990s   Dancehall’s golden age, Mighty Crown emerges   Shabba Ranks, Beenie Man       2000s   Global pop   Sean Paul, Elephant Man       2010s   Global Dancehall / Reggaeton era   Popcaan, Drake       2020s   Rise of local DIY sound   Mura Masa System and others   Diagram: Evolutionary genealogy of dancehall musicgraph TDA[Sound System(1940s)] --&gt; B[Ska(1960s)]B --&gt; C[Reggae / Dub(1970s)]C --&gt; D[Dancehall(1980s)]D --&gt; E[Global Dancehall(2000s)]E --&gt; F[Reggaeton / Afrobeats(2010s~)]D --&gt; G[Japanese Sound System culture(1990s~)]Conclusion: Where is the bass heading?A sound system is more than just audio equipment. It is an infrastructure of self-expression and a symbol of resistance and solidarity. On street corners with no electricity or studios, people amplify their voices, dance and celebrate. That energy is what gave birth to hip-hop, gave birth to reggaeton,And it has been passed down to today’s EDM and Afrobeats. If you trace the origin of the bass that roars at festival venues around the world,You will definitely end up at night in Kingston.

He wears a turban, looks deep into the camera, and plays the Hammond organ. His fingers danced smoothly across the keys, and he didn’t say a word. However, in the late 1990s, shocking facts were revealed in the documentary film Korla (2014). His real name was John Roland Redd, and he was African American. This “story of the mask” goes beyond a simple stage name anecdote. It brings to light the triple structure of race, foreign countries, and art in postwar American society. Chapter 2: Postwar America and “foreign dreams” {#Chapter 2}In America in the early 1950s, in the shadow of victory in World War II and the Cold War,““A yearning for the unknown’’ = Exoticism has become a cultural boom.   ”South Pacific’’ (1958) was a big hit in Hollywood.  Tiki bars became popular in homes, and bamboo furniture and tropical-patterned curtains filled the dreams of the common man.  In terms of music, Latin, Hawaiian, Arabian, and Indian music were consumed as “fantasy background music. ”In this context, the Pandit’s silence and mask came to symbolize an idealized “foreign tranquility. ” Chapter 3: The Birth of Exotica Music - From Les Baxter to Martin Denny {#Chapter 3}timelinetitle Genealogy of exotica music1940 : Les Baxter's  Ritual of the Savage  appears1957 : Martin Denny  Exotica  hit1958 : Arthur Lyman  Taboo 1961 : Yma Sumac  Legend of the Sun Virgin 1990 : Re-evaluation by Combustible EdisonLes Baxter’s 1952 album “Ritual of the Savage”It laid the foundation for the later sounds of Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman.

The production, which was constructed using only sight and sound without uttering words, provided a ““safe foreign country’’ for white viewers at the time. Pundit has had more than 1,000 broadcasts, giving her more television exposure than her contemporaneous Nat King Cole. However, the fact that he was only able to succeed by hiding his identity as a black artist;It is also a symbolic anecdote that illustrates the relationship between entertainment and racism. Chapter 5: The Truth Behind the Mask - Confessions of John Rowland {#Chapter 5}In 1998, according to an article published by Los Angeles Magazine,Pandit’s true identity is revealed to be John Roland Redd. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1916 and became an accomplished pianist in his teens. While working at a radio station in the 1940s, he created the fictional setting of an ““Indian prince. ’’ Rather than being a “black musician” in a discriminatory era,I can be accepted as a “foreign aristocrat”. It was a strategic disguise for a painful reality. Chapter 6: Reverberations of Exotica - From Longines Symphonette to Lo-Fi Revival {#Chapter 6}After the 1970s, exotica was once forgotten. However, in the 1990s, a re-evaluation began with the Lounge revival movement.

    "title": "[Column] Vijaya Anand and \"Dance Raja Dance\" — South Indian film music as carnival",
    "body": "Prologue: The beat revolution of South India in the late 1980s      Text: mmr   Theme: At the end of the 1980s, urban culture in southern India exploded with disco. Vijaya Anand”s “Dance Raja Dance’ is about the sound and visual carnival of Karnataka.    In the late 1980s, the Indian film industry was in the midst of change. Mumbai’s Hindi cinema (Bollywood) was at a turning point before A. R. Rehman, and a new sound was needed. Meanwhile, in the Kannada film industry (Sandalwood), Vijaya Anand was experimenting with pioneering musical innovations. Released in 1987, Dance Raja Dance was more than just an entertaining film. It was the intersection of South Indian sensibilities and global disco culture, and was the “sound of the future” for young people in regional cities. Chapter 1: The phenomenon of Vijaya AnandVijaya Anand (real name: S. V. Krishna Reddy) started his career as a film music composer in the early 1980s. Although he was under the influence of Ilaiyaraaja, who was an overwhelming presence at the time, he stood out in that he aimed for a more urban/electronic sound. The characteristics of his music can be summarized in the following three points:  Introduction to Western Disco — Synth bassline inspired by the rhythmic structure of Giorgio Moroder and Van McCoy.  Fusion with traditional Indian scales — Reconstructing Karnataka music raga on 4/4 beat.  Integration with cinematic production — The music was not just an insert song, but functioned as the ““engine’’ of the production.  ”Dance Raja Dance’’ is the most sophisticated crystallization of these elements. Chapter 2: The incident called “Dance Raja Dance” (1987)The film was the culmination of a musical-action-romance that brought together the stars of the time: director D. Rajendra Babu, lead actor Vishnuvardhan, and actress Khushbu. Story summaryA young man named Raja (Vishnuvardhan) lives as a dancer in a downtown area, but gains national popularity after participating in a television dance contest. After going through betrayal, love, and family secrets, they finally express their ““own roots’’ through dance, a moving story. The plot is simple, but what is noteworthy is the integration of the production and music. The title song ““Dance Raja Dance’’ is said to be the first song in Indian film history to combine electronic drums and Kannada rap. Chapter 3: “Disco” phenomenon in India in the 1980sAfter the success of ““Disco Dancer” (1982, Hindi) and ““Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu” (1978, Tamil), disco culture spread throughout India as a symbol of ““dance = freedom. ’’ In South India, this trend took on a unique variation. While Mumbai’s discotheques depicted an ““urban dream”, discotheques in Kannada films were an expression of ““regional pride”. Vijaya Anand’s music bridges rural and urban rhythms by fusing electronics with folk percussion instruments (thaviru, dhol, nadaswaram). This “hybridity” is the core of South Indian music. Chapter 4: Video production and dance choreographyThe dance scenes in ““Dance Raja Dance”’ were so ingenious that they exceeded the limits of Indian film technology at the time. Making full use of lighting, smoke, and mirror effects, a video art composition that looks like it”s aimed at the MTV generation is developed. The choreographer was Mugur Sundar (later the father of famous dance master Prabhu Deva), who was up-and-coming at the time. While he referenced steps from Hollywood movies, he boldly mixed in elements of Bharatanatyam hand gestures (mudras) and folk dance. This “South Indian MTV feel” was later inherited by A. R. Rehman and Harris Jayaraj. Chapter 5: Changes in social background and audience demographicsIn the late 1980s, southern India was undergoing a period of expansion of television culture, along with a wave of urbanization. It was a time when the state-run broadcaster Doordarshan opened up to commercial broadcasting, and young people from rural areas dreamed of becoming stars. The setting in which the main character of ““Dance Raja Dance’’, Raja, becomes famous through a TV show truly symbolizes the germination of neoliberal values. Overcoming the constraints of work, class, and family and achieving success through talent and hard work—this can be called the ““Indian version of the American Dream. ’’ Chapter 6: Soundtrack Analysis      Song title   Singer   Features   Notes         Dance Raja Dance   S. P. Balasubrahmanyam   Electronic drum + folk rhythm   Opening theme       Prema Prema   S. Janaki   Synth pad + raga melody   Romantic scene       Ninna Preetige   Mano, Vani Jairam   Call and Response Structure   Used in Contest Situations       Finale Medley   Various   Reprise composition of all songs   Dance final scene   It has been confirmed that these songs were created using cutting-edge equipment at the time, such as FM synth (Yamaha DX7) and Roland TR-707. In particular, the rising brass synth sound heard in the intro of ““Dance Raja Dance’’ reminds me of the textures of Moroder and Depeche Mode. Chapter Seven: Legacy of Vijaya AnandVijaya Anand has composed scores for many films since the 1990s, but few have been as innovative as Dance Raja Dance. However, his music gave younger music directors the perspective of ““film as a testing ground for popular music. ’’ A. R. Rehman’s early works Roja (1992) and the foundations of urban soundtracks such as Gentleman (1993) are clearly an extension of the experiments of Vijaya Anand and Bappi Lahiri. Chapter 8: Cultural Impact and ReappraisalIn the 21st century, ““Dance Raja Dance’’ is being reevaluated through YouTube and Spotify. The images and music of that time are not “kitsch” but are being reinterpreted as South Indian Futurism. For young Kannada-speaking people, this is not just nostalgia, but a starting point for cultural self-expression that moves from the local to the global.

However, the ““breath of liberation’’ was already resounding within the rhythm of music and dance. Vijaya Anand’s achievement lies in the use of music as a harbinger of social change. His disco beats were not just entertainment, but a declaration for South India to dance its own cultural future. "

    "body": "Prologue: Where cyber and primitive intersect - A person named Shoji YamashiroText: mmr｜Theme: About the entertainment Yamashiro-gumi formed in the early 1970s In the 1970s, there was a person who stood out at the border between Japanese music and visuals. Shoji Yamashiro (real name: Riki Ohashi). He graduated from the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Tohoku University, and was interested in life science, information, and sound. With a background of scientific thought and sensibility, he positioned art as ““an experiment to explore the relationship between humans and the environment. ’’ The place for this experiment was Geinoh Yamashirogumi, which was formed in the early 1970s. More than just a music group, it was a ““community for comprehensively exploring the relationship between sound, humans, and society” and was a ““place” that integrated music, ethnology, information theory, and anthropology. Chapter 1: Birth of the entertainment Yamashiro Gumi - Art as a “group”The starting point for the Geino Yamashiro Gumi was the formation of a ““collective’’ of people who came together across universities, companies, and professions. Doctors, teachers, engineers, students, housewives - people with different professions and philosophies shared an intuitive desire to ““live in sound’’. From the beginning, Yamashiro defined art not as an act of individual expression, but as the expression of a group. Therefore, their rehearsals were not just performances, but the process of ““sound generating a field. ’’The moment when body, voice, space, and time come together to resonate - that is the starting point for Geino Yamashiro Gumi.  “Music is the very structure of human consciousness. That’s why the sounds of a group are connected to the sounds of society. ”— Shoji Yamashiro (1982) Chapter 2: 80 types of “sounds of groups” from around the world - Quest for universal musical structureGeino Yamashiro-gumi was active from the late 1970s to the 1980s. He has actually performed and researched  ”80 types of ethnic performances from around the world’‘. This was not just a collection of folk music, but an exploration of the fundamental question, ““What is the sound that humans make as a group?’’ ◇ Examples of research/performance targets      Region   Music/Rituals   Research Focus         Bali, Indonesia   Kecak, Gamelan   Collective trance and time structure       African tropical forest   Pygmy forest singing   Synchronization of environmental sounds and the body       Eastern Europe Bulgaria   Female chorus   Unequal meter and overtone structure       Caucasus Georgia   Male chorus   Spatial resonance and sociality       Tibet/Mongolia   Homie chanting   Laryngeal resonance and overtone separation   Rather than treating these as “materials,” Yamashiro et al. observed and reconstructed their structure, function, and social significance. In particular, the ““acoustic structure that transcends time and space” of gamelan music in Bali is fundamental to the ““group creation”, ““information environment”, and ““sound environmental studies” of the Geino Yamashiro Gumi.  “People form groups based on sound. Sound evolves through groups. ”— Shoji Yamashiro Chapter 3: Reaching “AKIRA” – Fusion of electronics and ethnicityIn 1988, Geino Yamashiro Gumi composed the music for the world-famous animated film ““AKIRA’’ (directed by Katsuhiro Otomo). This is where Yamashiro’s acoustic philosophy reaches its peak. ◇ Acoustic design philosophy Bali gamelan polyrhythm × electronic pulse Tibetan esoteric chanting x sampled audio Urban reverberations and crowd sounds × spatial construction rhythmIt was not just a theatrical accompaniment, but a ““myth-building through sound’’, an attempt to connect the city and the primitive, the future and memory. The soundtrack of “AKIRA” has been reevaluated internationally as a fusion of electronic music and ethnic sounds. It also influenced later world-famous artists such as Aphex Twin, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Cornelius. Chapter 4: Sound Environment - Science and Philosophy of “Listening”After ““AKIRA”, Yamashiro developed the concept of ““environmental studies of sound” in parallel with his artistic activities. He reconsidered sound not just as an auditory stimulus, but as a ““point of contact between information and ecology. ’’ ◇ Main works and ideas      Book title   Publisher/year   Content summary   Link         “Sound and Civilization - Introduction to the Environmental Studies of Sound”   Iwanami Shoten, 2003   Investigation of the effects of rainforest sounds and gamelan music on the brain   Amazon       “Hypersonic Effect”   Iwanami Shoten, 2017   A monumental work that sharply questions the state of health and civilization   Amazon   Here, Yamashiro defined sound as a ““communication protocol between humans and the environment. ’’Sound is not a symbol, but an ecological and social activity itself. This idea resonates with later research on ““soundscape” and ““media ecology. ”  “Sound is an interface between the environment and information. Music is an algorithm by which a herd synchronizes itself with its environment. “ Chapter 5: Sensitivity as a Scientist - Physiology of Hearing and Social SoundHis scientific training at Tohoku University’s Faculty of Agriculture gave Yamashiro a unique analytical perspective. With an understanding of chemistry, biology, and the environment, he came up with the idea of ​​viewing sound not only as a physical phenomenon, but also as part of life’s activities. His approach is a back and forth between scientific observation and artistic practice. Rather than a laboratory, the human group itself is treated as an “acoustic system. ”There was an ““experimental ethics’’ that sought to match the rhythms of life and society.   ”The sounds we hear are images of the world reconstructed in our brains. So music is the act of rehearsing the very structure of the world. “ Chapter 6: Crowds in the 21st Century - The Significance of Performing Arts in the Information SocietyIn the modern age of social media and AI, the concept of “swarm” is becoming important again. It can be said that the practices of the Geino Yamashiro Gumi anticipated the ““regeneration of communal resonance’’. From “individual” to “group”. From “information” to “resonance”. The ideals advocated by the Geino Yamashiro Gumi in the 1970s are also the prototype for a ““new community’’ in a network society. Music is not something that “communicates”, but something that “resonates with”. What Shoji Yamashiro explored was performing arts as an ecology of information and emotion.

    "title": "[Column] Taj Mahal Travel Group and Takehisa Kosugi - A journey to unleash sound",
    "body": "I. Starting point in the 1960s: Beyond musical institutionsText: mmr｜Theme: A sonic pilgrimage where improvisation and environmental sounds intertwine - A record of a journey to the outside of music, drawn by Takehisa Kosugi and the Taj Mahal Travel Group In the early 1960s, Japan’s avant-garde music scene was quietly flourishing. Centered around the Experimental Workshop and Sogetsu Art Center led by Toru Takemitsu, Kei Ichiyanagi, and Joji Yuasa, the boundaries between genres such as music, dance, video, and lighting were being broken down. During this period, Takehisa Kosugi was studying violin at Tokyo University of the Arts, but he was beginning to feel the limits of traditional musical forms. He began to see sound as an ““event” rather than a ““structure,” and eventually began to explore improvisation and chance.  “Sound begins to live when it is separated from the will of the performer. ”— Takehisa Kosugi II. “Collective Music” and the encounter with John Cage (1964)In 1964, Kosugi formed Collective Music with Toru Takemitsu and Kei Ichiyanagi. In the same year, he performed with John Cage and David Tudor when the Merce Cunningham Dance Company visited Japan for the first time. This event marked a decisive turning point in the history of Japanese avant-garde music. The ideas of ““coincidence” and ““unintentionality” presented by Cage had a deep impact on Kosugi. Rather than having the performer “control” the sound, how do we create a state in which the sound “appears” naturally?This question became the theme of Kosugi’s life. III. The Art of Resonance and Action with Fluxus (1965–1969)In the mid-1960s, Kosugi became close to the international avant-garde movement ““Fluxus’’ and stepped into the realm of performance and happenings. The act of converting everyday objects into sound sources and dismantling the framework of time and space fundamentally shook the conventional view of music. As seen in his masterpieces “Music Expanded #2” and “Catch-Wave”,Kosugi turned the ““body that performs’’ itself into a piece of work, attempting to record the moment when the sound occurred. This trend had a direct influence on later ““sound art”, ““environmental music”, and ““acoustic improvisation’’. IV. Formation of the Taj Mahal Travel Group (1969–1970)In 1969, Kosugi formed the Taj Mahal Travelers as a new experimental subject. Seiji Nagai, Takashi Iijima, Masaaki Kikuchi (later left) and others joined the group. Using violin, cello, electronic equipment, brass, voice, radio waves, etc. He put into practice the philosophy that ““the place itself becomes an instrument. ’’ V. Traveling through sound: from India to Europe (1971–1972)In 1971, the Taj Mahal Tour Group departs for a tour of Europe. Their journey was not just a tour, but a ““sound pilgrimage. ’’Outdoors, with no power source or stage, the performance improvised and resonated with the wind, water, crowd, and radio waves.

Improvisational performances in various locations ranged from local cultural facilities, outdoors, to bases for student movements. VI. Deconstruction and expansion of sound: the ritual of improvisationThe Taj Mahal Tourists’ performances do not have the usual ““songs” or ““structure. ”Rather, it is more like the act of emitting sound into the environment and waiting for a chance resonance. They use PA systems and microphones creatively,The entire space was treated as a kind of “resonator. ”Kosugi, the leader, attaches a contact microphone to the violin and manipulates the feedback and radio noise while playing. We have created an ecosystem in which sound “occurs and disappears. ” VII. Record of 《Taj Mahal Travelers – July 15, 1972》The pinnacle of their activities was the album released in 1972. “Taj Mahal Travelers – July 15, 1972” (CBS/Sony). This is a live recording of an improvisational performance held around the Taj Mahal in Agra. It is highly praised as a ““soundscape’’ that perfectly combines time, space, and sound. There is no rhythm or melody on the album. Instead, the sound of wind, electronic sounds, voices, and the resonance of strings gently intersect,It presents an experience that invites the listener to go “inside the sound. ” VIII. Overseas activities and “Catch-Wave” (1975)After staying in Europe, Kosugi moved to the United States in the mid-1970s. Develops solo activities that combine electronic acoustics and improvisation. His 1975 masterpiece “Catch-Wave” (EM Records reissue) isThis is a soundscape piece that makes full use of violin, tape delay, and feedback. He also influenced Brian Eno and Robert Ashley. IX. Activities and evaluation in later yearsSince the 1980s, Kosugi has served as music director of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. While inheriting the philosophy of John Cage, he deepened the integration of dance and sound. Until his later years, based on his belief that “sound is a natural phenomenon,” he continued to create expressions that drifted between improvisation, environment, and silence. X. The legacy of Takehisa Kosugi and the Taj Mahal Tourist GroupToday, their activities include “sound art,” “field recording,” and “ambient music. ”It is being reevaluated as the source of diverse music trends. An attitude of listening to sound as a ““phenomenon” rather than ““material” or ““information. ’’This is the most important message that Kosugi left us.

    "title": "[Column] Shochu grown by sound: The harmony of fermentation that resonates in Amami Oshima",
    "body": "Prologue: On the island of the sound of waves and shochuText: mmr｜Theme: An experiment carried out on Amami Oshima to encourage the aging of shochu by making it listen to music. Exploring its scientific basis and cultural background Amami Oshima, the farthest point of the Nansei Islands. On this island, brown sugar shochu is surrounded by the sun and sea breeze, and people are quietly ““listening’’ to music. At night, the faint sounds of classical music, jazz, and island songs flow from the depths of the storage room, and alcohol molecules tremble inside the stainless steel tank. They say that the sound makes the shochu softer. This is not just a romantic metaphor. The phenomenon that physical vibrations caused by sound waves aids in ripening and brings out the flavor is currently attracting attention. In this article, we will take a look at the whole picture of the ““acoustically aged shochu’’ that brewers in Amami Oshima are trying to create, from both scientific and cultural perspectives. Chapter 1: The origin of Amami brown sugar shochuAmami Oshima’s shochu culture dates back to the late Edo period. On this island, where sugar cane cultivation was popular, a unique distilled spirit made from molasses from pomace was born - brown sugar shochu. In 1949 (Showa 24), when the Amami Islands were returned to Japan, a special exemption was granted for ““brown sugar shochu’’ as defined by the National Tax Agency. This is the only shochu standard that allows the combination of brown sugar and rice malt, and has become a cultural heritage exclusive to the Amami Islands.  “Brown sugar shochu is made from Amami’s soil, water, and wind. ”—— From an interview with the brewer of Amami Oshima Kaiun Sake Brewery A soft texture created by the minerality of brown sugar and the soft water of the island. It wasn’t until the beginning of the 21st century that the idea of ​​using sound to enhance this natural blessing emerged. Chapter 2: Birth of alcohol that listens to sound● Origin of ideaThe impetus was the ““acoustic aging’’ of wine that a wine brewer saw in Tokyo. I learned about an attempt to speed up maturation by playing classical music,He returned to Amami thinking, ““Maybe it could be done with shochu. ’’ In 2005, a certain warehouse on Amami Oshima installed acoustic speakers in its storage room for the first time. The subjects tested were classical music (Bach, Mozart) and island songs (such as Satokuni Taka’s ““Asahabushi’’). Six months later, the people involved who tasted it were surprised. “Even though it’s the same raw sake, it was more mellow when I listened to it. ” ● Mechanism of acoustic maturationSound waves cause minute vibrations inside the liquid. Changing the frequency increases molecular collisions and accelerates the esterification reaction. This is said to increase the aromatic components and reduce the irritation of alcohol.   ”Bass waves move the liquid as deep bass waves, and high frequencies cause the surface layer to vibrate minutely. It’s like receiving a sonic massage. “—— Researcher, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Food Science, Kagoshima University Chapter 3: Sounds played by Amami’s storehousesEach brewery in Amami Oshima has a different “style of sound. ”       Brewery name   Music used   Effects/features   Sound equipment         Amami Oshima Kaiun Sake Brewery   Island songs, drums, sanshin   Increased sweetness and richness   Underwater transducer       Amami Brown Sugar Sake Brewery   Jazz (Miles Davis)   Alleviates bitterness   Wooden barrel speaker       Amami Oshima Sake Brewery   Classic (Mozart, Bach)   Gorgeous aroma   Ultrasonic vibration plate       Sato no Akebono (Machida Sake Brewery)   Natural sounds (waves, wind, birds)   Soft texture   Constant temperature storage + built-in speaker   Each brewery has its own unique ““listening time. ’’Most breweries play the sound at night, but some breweries play the sound throughout the fermentation process. In particular, ““taiko and sanshin’’ are rich in low frequencies and have high transmission efficiency to liquids. Chapter 4: “Taste of sound” seen through scientific eyesExperimental data is also being accumulated. According to a joint study by Kagoshima University,Shochu that has undergone classical acoustic aging has a higherAverage 8% reduction in aldehyde content,Ester ratio increased by 12%. In addition, in sensory tests, the products were highly rated as ““rich in aroma” and ““not irritating. ”The increase in molecular movement caused by sound wave stimulation is exactly what creates “taste tuning. ”  “Shochu is alive. When you give it sound, it reacts as if it were breathing. ”—— Chief brewer/Kikaijima Sake Brewery Factory Manager Chapter 5: Fusion of acoustic maturity and Shimauta cultureFor Amami, “sound” is not just background music. Shimauta is the prayer of ancestors, a dialogue with nature, and the memory of a community. The song that plays in the storage room isIt is also a labor song for sugarcane farmers who once crossed the ocean. Although acoustic maturation is a scientific endeavor,It is also a ritual to engrave the memory of Amami into shochu. Chapter 6: The taste of the future created by soundNowadays, sonic maturity is spreading beyond Amami. Experiments are progressing with Iki shochu in Nagasaki and barley shochu in Fukuoka. It has also spread to the world of wine, sake, and whisky. In the future, there may come a time when aging will be controlled by “sound design” generated by AI. AI composes a shochu aging song,Alcohol molecules dance to the rhythm——That day is approaching. Chronology: History of Amami shochu and acoustic maturation      Years   Events         1600s   Sugarcane cultivation begins in Amami       1800s   Start of production of local shochu using brown sugar       1949   Return of the Amami Islands to Japan, special approval for “brown sugar shochu”       2005   Amami Oshima’s first acoustically aged shochu test begins       2008   Kagoshima University begins scientific research on acoustic maturation       2015   Each brewery develops its own music aging brand       2020s   Acoustic aging becomes popular in sake breweries in Japan and abroad, AI control technology is introduced       2025   Amami brown sugar shochu in preparation for application as UNESCO intangible cultural heritage   Diagram: Mechanism of acoustic maturationgraph TDA[Sound generation from speaker] --&gt; B[Microvibration in liquid]B --&gt; C [Molecular kinetic activation]C --&gt; D [Esterification reaction promotion]D --&gt; E [Increase in aroma components]E --&gt; F [Taste becomes mellower]Chapter 7: Listening tongue, resonating heartPeople can “hear” sounds through their sense of taste. For example, it is known that bitterness is perceived to be weaker in a space where soft sounds are played. In other words, sound and taste are connected in the brain. The act of listening to the sound of Amami shochu isIt”s not just science, it”s also the reunification of humans and nature. The sound of the wind, the sound of waves, the sound of singing, and the sound of fermentation. They become one harmony,A small universe is playing inside the glass.

Chapter 10: Diversity of flavors created by sounds and terrainAmami’s topography stretches 160km from north to south, and the humidity, wind direction, and acoustic characteristics of the coastline vary from region to region. For example, a storehouse facing Tatsugo Bay takes advantage of the sound of waves. Warehouses located in mountainous areas create a maturing environment that takes advantage of natural reverberations. Acoustic maturation is not just a “device”;This is the “resonance of the island” where the topography itself becomes an instrument.  “Amami is an island like one giant speaker. The wind plays a low pitch, the waves play a medium pitch, and the voices of insects play a high pitch. “—— Machida Sake Brewery・Torji talk Conclusion: Poetry of sound and fermentationWhen I passed in front of the Amami storehouse at night,A faint sound of sanshin flows from the speakers. Inside, brown sugar shochu is sleeping quietly. I’m listening to that melody. Time and sound slowly refine the taste. “Maturity of sound” created by Amami”s climate and human wisdom——It is another kind of music played by the island.

    "title": "[Column] Salsoul Orchestra and MFSB - Evolution from Philadelphia to Disco",
    "body": "The moment Philadelphia strings made the world danceText: mmr｜Theme: About the musical revolution that formed the basis of “disco” In the early 1970s, a musical revolution that later became the prototype for ““disco’’ occurred in Philadelphia, a city on the east coast of the United States. At the center of this were MFSB (Mother Father Sister Brother) and Salsoul Orchestra. They established a new sound called ““orchestra soul’’ by fusing gorgeous arrangements with plenty of strings and horns, a detailed rhythm section, and a soulful spirit. This lineage later spread to disco culture around the world, and was inherited by house, Latin, and even hip-hop sampling cultures. The birth of the Philadelphia Sound: Gamble &amp; Huff and Sigma SoundAt the end of the 1960s, Philadelphia International Records (PIR), by Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, supported the Philadelphia music scene. They began their activities based at Sigma Sound Studios, aiming to replace Motown as a new center for black music. The recording was supported by an exclusive session group – MFSB. The members of MFSB included the following:  Earl Young (drums) Norman Harris (guitar) Ronnie Baker (bass) Bobby Eli (guitar) Vincent Montana Jr. (vibraphone/arranger)The smooth grooves created by these players became a worldwide brand known as ““TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)’’. MFSB - The moment when strings dominate the grooveIn 1973, the album ““Love Is The Message’’ was released under the name MFSB. The song of the same name became an anthem representing the history of Seoul, and was loved as a ““standard bridge song’’ by DJs in the early days of disco. Earl Young’s ““four-on-the-floor’’ rhythm was what would later become the basic beat of disco and house. Furthermore, Vincent Montana Jr. ’s vibes and string arrangements gave the rhythms of black music a classical elegance. MFSB was more than just a band, it was the embodiment of a new concept: a ““studio orchestra. ’’ The Birth of the Salsoul Orchestra: A Declaration of Independence for the Philly SoundIn 1975, Vincent Montana Jr. left MFSB and formed Salsoul Orchestra to pursue his ideals. Backed by Salsoul Records (founders: Cayre brothers), they aimed for a disco sound with strong Latin elements. Montana uses the orchestration skills he cultivated at PIR to fuse Latin percussion and strings. As a result, a unique equation was created: Disco+Orchestra+Salsa=Salsoul. The representative song “Salsoul Hustle” is a perfect symbol of this. Congas, timbales, strings, horns, and muted guitar all intertwine exquisitely, creating a feel of Latin cheerfulness and Philly sophistication at the same time. Vincent Montana Jr. - Craftsman aesthetics and disco utopiaMontana’s arranging philosophy was clear.  “The orchestra is your weapon to dominate the club. Make the vibes, harps, and strings dance in the groove. ” His ideal is “music that dances gracefully. ”They gave classical architectural beauty to the dance culture that originated on the street, and elevated the music to an “elegant festival. ” On the other hand, his extreme perfectionism made the studio musicians nervous, and it is said that each recording session required dozens of takes.

The horn riff of “Love Break” and the percussion of “Ooh I Love It” were reimagined on Public Enemy”s “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back” and Eric B. &amp; Rakim”s “Paid in Full. ” Also in the 1990s, Masters at Work (Louie Vega &amp; Kenny Dope) reworked Salsoul’s catalog and remixed it in a house context. Salsoul”s vinyl records have become a club DJ”s holy book.

They made the transition from soul to disco with brilliant and intelligent sound design. The blood of Philadelphia certainly flows through the current club culture - house and new disco. It is the paradoxical beauty of strings playing the rhythm. The architectural beauty created by Montana’s hands continues to shine deep within the dance floor.  “The Sound of Philadelphia never dies—it just keeps dancing. ”― Vincent Montana Jr. "

    "title": "[Column] Marvin Gaye: Between Love and Pain - Salvation and Destruction as Seen by the God of Souls",
    "body": "From Motown star to lonely wanderer to tragic end      Text: mmr   Theme: “Love”, “Social Justice”, and “Inner Darkness”. About Marvin Gaye’s music, a “human anthem” that goes beyond the boundaries of soul music   A hotel room in Brussels, 1982. Marvin Gaye sat alone at the microphone as the dry beat of a Roland TR-808 blared. ““Midnight Love’’ was an album of prayer born between exile and rebirth, love and self-destruction. The man who once led the golden age of Motown and spread the word “sexual healing” to the world eventually ended his life at the hands of his father. The paradox is that those who continued to sing about love were the ones who were the most hungry for love. Marvin Gaye’s life was the epitome of “the most beautiful, most painful blues” in the history of American music. Prologue: Intersection of light and shadowThe life of Marvin Gaye, known as the ““Prince of Soul” and ““Prince of Motown,” was filled with family complications, conflicts with himself, constant creative endeavors, and a tragic ending behind his spectacular success. His music was more than just a “pop hit”; it was an amalgamation of social messages, personal confessions, and grooves. In this article, we will reconsider him not just as a musical genius, but as a human being who lived a ““strange life. ’’ We will unravel his progress from two axes: changes in music and his own inner oscillations. Chapter 1: Early life and early musical activities (1939-1960)Childhood and family backgroundBorn Marvin Pentz Gay Jr. on April 2, 1939, in Washington, D. C. Her father, Marvin Gaye Sr. , was a church preacher who provided a strict religious education, and her mother, Alberta, was a woman who worked both at home and outside the home. As a child, he grew up singing in the church choir and learning to play the piano and drums. However, since his childhood, he had been exposed to violence and a controlling attitude from his father, and he was in such a tense state that he later said that he lived with an almighty father who was like a king. Approaching Youth, the U. S. Air Force, and Doo-WopIn the mid-1950s, Gaye enlisted in the U. S. Air Force, but was discharged after a short time due to his rebellion against discipline. His interest in music grew, and he began working with doo-wop groups such as “The Marquees” and “The Moonglows. ” These activities served as an important foundation for my solo career. Eventually, he moved to the Detroit/Motown area, and in 1961, he seized the opportunity to make his debut as a solo singer. Encounter with MotownAn encounter with Berry Gordy, founder of the Motown label, paved the way for him to become a solo singer. After his debut, while adapting to Motown’s system of mass-producing hits for young people, he began to develop a desire for ““adult songs” and ““a voice that speaks volumes. ”During this period, he gradually began to realize that he could move from ““just singing” to ““talking through songs. ” Chapter 2: Growth as a hit maker (1960s)Initial success and struggles with the Motown establishmentIn 1962, he had his first hit with “Stubborn Kind of Fellow. ” After that, he released a series of major hits such as “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)” (1964) and “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” (1968). At the same time, however, a gap emerged between his desired position as an ““adult crooner” and the ““youth-oriented R&amp;B hit” that Motown wanted, and internal conflict deepened. Duet Era: Love and SadnessDuring this period, his duet with Tami Terrell was of great significance in his career. Together they achieved success with songs such as “Ain”t Nothing Like the Real Thing” and “You”re All I Need to Get By. ”However, the tragedy of Tami Terrell’s worsening condition, stage collapse, and death had a deep psychological impact on Gay, accelerating the fluctuations in her inner world. The beginnings of self-expressionIn 1968, they had one of the biggest hits in Motown history with “I Heard It Through the Grapevine. ” With this opportunity, she began to change from a singer who makes hits to an artist who has something to say. The experiences of this period form the background that leads to the turning point of “What”s Going On,” which will be covered in the next chapter. Chapter 3: Turning Points – From “What”s Going On” to “Here, My Dear” (1970-1976)“What”s Going On” (1971): Musical accusation and transformationOn May 21, 1971, the album “What”s Going On” was released. Focusing on social issues such as the Vietnam War, poverty, and environmental destruction, he has established himself as someone who not only sings but also speaks. This was a revolutionary event within the “hit factory” that was Motown. With this album, he was involved in writing, composing, and producing the album himself, showing his independence as an artist. “Let”s Get It On” (1973) and the exploration of sexualityIn 1973”s “Let”s Get It On,” she delved deeper into the theme of love/desire, demonstrating her “sex appeal” as a soul singer. There is a clear shift from the former “social accusation” to “inner passion. ”During this period, Gaye experienced the joy of creation, as well as the failure of love and financial pressure in his personal life, and these fluctuations cast a shadow on his work. “Here, My Dear” (1976) – Establishment as a confessional albumIn 1976, he released the album Here, My Dear, which reflected the terms of his divorce from his wife, Anna Gordy. Although this was not a commercial success, it was positioned as a “confession album” that was later reevaluated. After releasing this album, Gaye was exhausted both physically and mentally and reached a turning point in his life. Chapter 4: A period of chaos and rebirth (1977-1983)Tax avoidance, escape from Europe, preparation for restartIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, gay men faced many challenges in the United States, including tax problems, drug use, and creative stagnation. Moving to Belgium and spending more time in Europe took on an ““escapism’’ both musically and physically. In the midst of all this, he was looking for a comeback, seeking new sounds and new environments. “Midnight Love” (1982)/”Sexual Healing”On November 8, 1982, Marvin Gaye released his first album after the transfer, ““Midnight Love,’’ making a huge comeback. A major point of this album is the use of the famous Roland TR-808 throughout. Appearance and meaning of Roland TR-808The Roland TR‑808 (commonly known as ““808’’) is an analog/programmable rhythm machine that was introduced in the early 1980s and was not a commercial success at the time. However, when it was used in songs such as “Sexual Healing,” the inorganic sound of the drum machine was fused with a modern “soul mood,” and it had a great influence on later soul/R&amp;B/hip-hop. Specifically, in “Sexual Healing,” the bass drum, hi-hat, and clap at the beginning are composed of 808-derived sounds, which creates a contrast between the “mechanical groove” and the “human singing voice” throughout the song. The production background seems to be that due to production budget and number restrictions at the time, it was necessary to proceed with production using machines rather than using a large band. This ““fusion of man and machine”’ also overlaps with Marvin Gaye”s own life - the sound of his own voice (human) and machine (808), and the frustration and rebirth behind it. Last live performance, TV appearance, and deathIn 1983, he appeared on the TV show “Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever” and performed classic songs from yesteryear. However, on April 1, 1984, he was shot by his father, Marvin Gaye Sr. , at his parents’ home in Los Angeles and passed away at the age of 44. This sudden tragedy symbolized the antinomy of his life: success and despair, salvation and bondage, and left a strong impression not only in the history of music but also as a human drama. Chapter 5: Legacy, influence, and the strange “what ifs”Pioneer to the liberation of the music industry and artistsMarvin Gaye was not only a hit maker, but also someone who paved the way for artists to independently create music themselves. The album “What”s Going On” was a work in which he was deeply involved in writing, composing, and producing the lyrics, and had a great influence on subsequent R&amp;B/neo-soul. Furthermore, the use of the Roland TR-808 on ““Midnight Love’’ also showed new possibilities for the fusion of electronic equipment and soul music. Personal strange fateGay’s life is filled with the ““curious” fate of childhood domestic violence, love breakdowns, financial and drug problems, and being shot and killed by his father. This trend goes beyond the framework of a mere ““tragic star” and reveals a human image of a man whose ““talent and suffering’’ intertwine. Furthermore, when you think about it from a ““what if” perspective, there are many hypotheses that come to mind: what if he had broken off his relationship with his father, what if he had not been completely trapped in the Motown system, what if he had continued to live. They are evidence of a ““strange life” where chance and necessity intertwine. Re-evaluation and expansion of expression in modern timesEven after Gaye’s death, his music has been remastered, rediscovered, sampled, and continues to influence new generations today. For example, the discovery of unreleased demo sound sources has also been reported. In addition, there is a movement to make his life into a film or documentary, and it is gaining recognition not only as a piece of music history but also as a ““human drama. ’’ Final chapter: The soul that continues to singLooking back on Marvin Gaye’s life, it seems that while music itself was his ““salvation,” it was also his ““captivity. ” Through his voice, he continued to sing about the pain of society, the joy of love, and his own struggles. The words “If you cannot find peace within yourself, you will never find it anywhere else” are attributed to him. There is a shadow in the light of music, and there is light in the shadow - I think it is this antinomy that makes him more than just a “legend”. His voice continues to be heard throughout time. I hope that this manuscript provides an opportunity to reconsider Marvin Gaye, his music, and his strange life.

    "title": "[Column] Joe Hisaishi and Studio Ghibli - 40 years of music-woven stories",
    "body": "Prologue: When music moves the story      Text: mmr   Theme: A long column that looks back on the history of collaboration between Joe Hisaishi and Studio Ghibli, based on facts. Tracing 40 years of musical history, from the origin of the name to the main soundtrack   In the history of Japanese film, the existence of composer Joe Hisaishi (English name: Joe Hisaishi) is unique. His music is not just ““movie accompaniment’’, but has functioned as an important component that forms the world of the work itself. Since 1984’s Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, the musical universe created in collaboration with director Hayao Miyazaki has transcended the context of animated films and received international acclaim. This column carefully traces the relationship between Joe Hisaishi’s musical history and Studio Ghibli works, based on facts. Chapter 1: Early life and musical foundationJoe Hisaishi (real name: Mamoru Fujisawa) was born on December 6, 1950 in Nakano City, Nagano Prefecture. He became familiar with the piano from an early age and studied at the Department of Composition at Tokyo National College of Music. During his student days, he became interested in contemporary music, especially minimal music, and is said to have been influenced by Steve Reich and Philip Glass. After graduating, he worked as a contemporary musician under the name Mamoru Fujisawa, producing many electronic acoustic works and songs for television programs. From this period, the idea of ​​merging electronic sounds and live music began to emerge, which would lead to the style of later film music. Chapter 2: Origin of the name - Birth of “Joe Hisaishi”In the late 1970s, Mamoru Fujisawa began using his stage name as he expanded his activities into pop music and commercial music. His name is Joe Hisaishi. He has publicly stated that the name was invented in honor of American composer and producer Quincy Jones. Quincy → It is said to be a play on the Japanese pronunciation ““kuinshi” and ““hisaishi”. Furthermore, “Joe” was taken from the “Joe” of “Jones”, resulting in the English notation “Joe Hisaishi”. This name was first used officially on the 1981 album Information.   ”I wanted to do music that transcends genres like Quincy Jones. That’s why I chose my name to symbolize “musical freedom. ” “― Joe Hisaishi (from NHK “SWITCH Interview”) Chapter 3: “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind” (1984) - The first encounter between film and musicIn 1984, Hisaishi was chosen to be in charge of the music for the film ““Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind’’ by Tokuma Shoten and Top Craft. The song uses a combination of synthesizers and ethnic instruments, which is unusual for animation music. Initially, director Hayao Miyazaki is said to have wanted ““music that would make you feel the breath between nature and machinery. ’’In response, Hisaishi proposed an ““environmental music approach’’ that depicts a worldview through rhythm and tone. The main theme, “Legend of the Wind,” later became one of Hisaishi’s signature songs. This success began a long-term collaboration between Miyazaki and Hisaishi. Chapter 4: “Castle in the Sky” (1986) - Establishment of the symphonic scaleFor 1986’s Castle in the Sky, Hisaishi turned to a more orchestral sound. The magnificent theme song ““Kimi wo Seite’’ performed by strings and brass has received high praise both domestically and internationally. In this piece, the melodic simplicity and repetitive structure are cleverly designed. There is an attempt to integrate the ideas of minimal music into a classical context.  ”Laputa” can be said to be a work that established the ““universality of emotion” in Ghibli music. Chapter 5: “My Neighbor Totoro” (1988) and “Memory of Time” ”My Neighbor Totoro”’ is an example of Hayao Miyazaki”s works in which music is closely tied to the story. Hisaishi created a warm sound centered around piano, woodwinds, and strings. The representative songs “Sanpo” and “Kaze no Torimichi” contain a faint melancholy in the cheerfulness of nursery rhymes. “Children”s time” is expressed through sound. Through this work, Hisaishi became widely recognized as a ““composer who expresses emotions through sound. ’’ Chapter 6: “Kiki’s Delivery Service” (1989) - Growth and urban rhythmKiki’s Delivery Service, released in 1989, features a light and airy sound centered on piano and brass. Since the story is set in a modern European city, Hisaishi introduced elements of jazz and pop. This diversity influenced his later works, showing that Hisaishi’s musical idioms were oriented toward ““crossing genre boundaries. ’’ Chapter 7: “Porco Rosso” (1992) - Music of romance and nostalgia ”Porco Rosso’’ adopted a style that was conscious of European music from the 1920s and 1930s. The main theme, ““When the cherries ripen,’’ and the waltz in the play express the emotion and romance of the interwar period. With this work, Hisaishi first constructed ““imaginary period music’’ and demonstrated that music functions as part of the period setting. Chapter 8: Princess Mononoke (1997) - An orchestral exploration of spiritualityIn 1997, when creating the music for Princess Mononoke, Hisaishi used a full orchestra and chorus to create a sound with religious depth. The theme of this work is the coexistence of nature and humans, and Hisaishi’s music also develops in a way that supports this idea. The use of a mixed chorus, the profound sound of the timpani, and the placement of silence show the maturity of Hisaishi’s musical diction. That year, Hisaishi also composed the music for Takeshi Kitano’s ““HANA-BI’’, which received high acclaim in a different context at the same time. Chapter 9: Spirited Away (2001) - Establishing a worldwide reputationIn 2001, Studio Ghibli”s Spirited Away was released, and Hisaishi”s music attracted international attention. The theme song ““Always Again and Again’’ (composed by Joe Hisaishi, sung by Yumi Kimura) won the Best Music Award at the 25th Japan Academy Awards. The music is characterized by the clarity of the melody and the beauty of the “ma”, which enhances the fantasy of the story. This work won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2003, and Hisaishi’s name spread around the world. Chapter 10: After Howl’s Moving Castle (2004) - Waltz and Circular StructureIn 2004”s ““Howl”s Moving Castle,” the main theme ““Life’s merry-go-round” has a structure that runs through the entire work. The melody, based on a waltz in triple time, symbolizes the work’s ““circulating time. ’’ In his follow-up, Ponyo on the Cliff (2008), he pursued the purity of a nursery rhyme. The Wind Rises (2013) featured quiet, restrained piano pieces. Throughout these works, Hisaishi’s music becomes an element that governs the ““inner time of the story. ’’ Chapter 11: “How do you live?” (2023) - Sound abstraction and new challengesHow do you live?, which will be released in 2023, is director Hayao Miyazaki’s first full-length film in 10 years. Joe Hisaishi was once again in charge of the music. This work uses an abstract sound structure, emphasizing resonance and texture rather than melody. Hisaishi conducted the London Symphony Orchestra and achieved a high standard of music production in both recording and performance. This work is the latest example of Hisaishi’s continued bridging of film music and classical music.

    "title": "[Column] Mobile Suit Gundam and the universe of music - Mobile suits as a symphony",
    "body": "I. Starting point in the 1960s: Beyond musical institutionsText: mmr｜Theme: How music supported the “realism” of the Gundam worldview In 1979, “Mobile Suit Gundam” was not just a robot anime,It was born as a realist work depicting war and humans. What was echoing in the background was an orchestral score by Takeo Watanabe. It was a grand genealogy of musicians’ sounds that eventually traversed the series. In this article, we interpret “Gundam music” as a symphony of Japanese anime music history. Column manuscriptIntroduction  Mobile Suit Gundam began airing as a TV anime in 1979. It vividly depicted themes such as war, Newtypes, and space battles, and became the beginning of a profound series of works that went beyond the boundaries of giant robot (mobile suit) anime. However, in this series, along with the visual and narrative elements of mecha and human drama, another important pillar is ““music’’. Theme songs, insert songs, and musical accompaniment (BGM) are not just accessories; they support the story, expand the worldview, and play a role in stirring the emotions of viewers. In this article, we will look at the Mobile Suit Gundam series from the perspective of music. While tracing the changes in the series and music from 1979 to 2025, we will decipher how music has shaped Gundam and how it has changed over time. The structure of music, changes in lyrics, melodies, recording/distribution formats, and thematic functions played by music - let’s take a journey to “listen” to the world of Gundam, using these as clues. I would like readers to listen carefully to the world of the work while remembering their favorite Gundam theme songs and insert songs. Through this column, we will explore the question of why “Gundam music” continues to be talked about, sung, and remixed across generations. Chapter 1: Early TV series (1979-1980s)1. 1 Gundam’s first appearance and historical backgroundIn April 1979, the television series ““Mobile Suit Gundam’’ began airing. Unlike traditional “hero robot” anime, it advocates a “real robot” view, depicts war as a quagmire, and delves deeply into human drama as well as mecha action through the growth of the boy Amuro Ray and the setting of the Universal Century (U. C. ) war with the Principality of Zeon. Looking back at the music environment at the time, it was also a time when TV anime theme songs and insert songs were beginning to shift from “play songs for children” to “hit songs for general circulation. ” As the base of music listeners expanded from light pop to synth orchestras, Gundam music was also undergoing a change. 1. 2 Characteristics of theme songs, insert songs, and musical accompanimentThe opening song for the original Mobile Suit Gundam, ““Fly! Gundam (sung by Kou Ikeda)” (lyrics by Tsutomu Isoya/composed by Yuji Matsuyama), was a simple yet catchy song that conveyed the image of a Gundam flying through outer space, embodying the scale of the work”s world and the boy”s sense of adventure through sound. In addition, Hiroyuki Osaka, Chuaaki Watanabe, and others provided the background music that supported the depiction of battle, space, and psychology, and used sound to convey themes such as the tense atmosphere of the ““battlefield” and the awakening of ““new types. ’’ At this stage, there are three main innovations that Gundam music has shown.  Generalization of theme songs:Anime theme songs are increasingly appearing on Oricon”s top charts, and they have begun to take on the aspect of ““pop music” instead of ““songs for children”s programs. ”    Deepening of the musical accompaniment: It was not just a background sound, but was constructed as a sound to depict war and human drama.     Unification of story and music  :For example, the keywords “space,” “battlefield,” and “new type” in the work became established as “sound images” through the music and sound design. In this way, the Gundam music of the 1979-80s can be said to be an opportunity to reconsider anime music as a next-level culture. 1. 3 Musical innovation and its meaningThe meaning that Gundam music played in this era can be summarized as follows. First, as anime music began to connect with the mass market, the works themselves began to be developed as “music products. ” Music releases, such as theme song singles, theatrical accompaniment album releases, and song introductions on radio programs, became a regular part of the production. Music also served as a device to channel the emotions of the audience. The bass rhythm during battle scenes, the tranquil strings in outer space, the chorus when the Newtype awakens, the lyrical melodies during scenes of friendship and farewell… these acoustic effects supported the multilayered story world of the Gundam series. Furthermore, these musical devices had a major influence on subsequent series. For example, in 1985, ““To the Planet of Water with Love’’ (sung by Hiroko Moriguchi) had Neil Sedaka as the composer, and international composers and melodies have begun to be used. In this way, it can be said that the early Gundam music opened up the perspective of ““anime music as a cultural asset. ’’ Chapter 2: Developments from the 1990s to the 2000s (“Anime Song”/Remix Era)2. 1 Expansion of the “Gundam” brand and changes in the music sceneIn the 1990s, the Gundam brand expanded beyond the TV series to include OVAs, movie versions, games, and plastic models. In terms of music, anime songs (anisongs) have become established as a genre, and theme songs/insert songs have come to be promoted as the “face” of artists. At the same time, the number of theme songs with synth sounds, dance beats, and pop-style structures increased, and we began to see a shift in musicality from the traditional structure of ““serious background music depicting war + hero anthems’’ to the side of pop culture. 2. 2 Example: “Mobile Fighter G Gundam”, “New Mobile Report Gundam W” and theme song changesIn the TV anime “Mobile Suit Gundam W” (New Mobile Suit Gundam W) that aired in 1995, the opening theme “Just Communication” (sung by TWO-MIX) adopted a synth beat and a pop melody, making it a work that stands out from traditional Gundam theme songs. The appearance of this song was also an opportunity to change the conventional image of Gundam = war drama + heavy music to a slightly lighter version of a hero song that can be heard in pop music. Additionally, OVA and movie versions now have a richer variety of music products, including theme songs, insert songs, character songs, and remix discs. Music has expanded from being “exclusive for works” to “exclusive for brands. ” 2. 3 Drama accompaniment, theme songs, and insert songs: changing tastes over timeDuring this period, the range of music development expanded significantly. In addition to theme songs, insert songs, character songs (songs sung under the character’s name), remix albums, best albums, live albums, etc. were released one after another, and the categorization of music products progressed. The musical accompaniment (BGM) has also evolved. There was a growing movement to boldly fuse piano, strings, and synths, and a strong trend emerged from the 1980s’ “battlefield” sound to express the “feelings of a character” and “detailed internal depiction” through sound. In this way, Gundam music in the 1990s and 2000s evolved into “character/brand music,” and the music itself became the “face” that supported the work. Chapter 3: 2010s to recent years (diversification/fusion of video and music)3. 1 Trends in Gundam music since the 2010sIn the 2010s, the way music is distributed and consumed has changed dramatically. With the shift from CDs to distribution and streaming, anime theme songs and musical accompaniments are also expanding beyond traditional formats. The Gundam series is no exception, and has become increasingly diverse, with soundtracks being released exclusively through digital distribution, orchestral arrangement versions, and deluxe editions. We have entered an era in which “Gundam music” is not just “background music to listen to” for listeners, but can be easily accessed as “music to listen to” through streaming, live performances, collaborations, etc. 3. 2 Example: Soundtrack composition of the “Mobile Suit Gundam SEED” seriesFor “Mobile Suit Gundam SEED” (2002-), Hiroyuki Kono and others were in charge of the music, rather than the composer Hiroyuki Sawano, and the theme song, insert song, character song, remix disc, and “Suit CD” were developed. This structure shows that Gundam music has become “a product/culture that cannot be separated from the work. ” Music has become a brand, and it has come to function in places other than productions (live shows, bonus CDs, collaborations). 3. 3 Recent work: Musical experiment in “Mobile Suit Gundam: Witch of Mercury”The latest work, “Mobile Suit Gundam: Witch of Mercury” (2022~), is an attempt at a fusion of “academic orchestra + modern electronics” by composer Ko Omama. In terms of music, it has transcended the framework of Gundam and reached generations as ““modern anime music,’’ and it is noticeable that it is being released both digitally and on LP (analog). In this way, it can be said that Gundam music since the 2010s has entered a period of innovation in its “format, medium, and expression,” and is taking a multi-layered approach. Chapter 4: The theme of “Gundam” told through music — war, hope, loneliness4. 1 The narrative role of musicWhen we look back at the Gundam series from a musical perspective, we can definitely see themes such as “war,” “hope,” “solitude,” and “humanity’s potential” etched into it. For example, the intimidating and tense background music that plays during battlefield scenes, the tranquil melody when Newtypes appear, and the warm theme song that plays during friendship scenes - music expresses the emotion and atmosphere of the story. In this way, “sound” helps the interpretation of the story, and by “listening” it is possible to enter deeper into the world of the work. It’s no exaggeration to say that music delicately depicts “mental images” that cannot be grasped by sight alone. 4. 2 Lyric analysis example of theme song/insert songFor example, the 1985 song “Water Star with Love” (sung by Hiroko Moriguchi) was written and composed by a foreign writer, and incorporates the keywords “earth,” “space,” and “future” into the lyrics, and sings of the loneliness of fighting and the hope of wishing for. ([Wikipedia][1])In addition, the ending theme of the 1988 movie version of Mobile Suit Gundam: Char’s Counterattack, ““Beyond the Time~Beyond the Moebius Universe~” (sung by TM NETWORK), expressed the themes of ““Who do we fight for?” and ““An Endless Battle’’ with magnificent music. ([Wikipedia][6])In this way, deciphering the meaning behind the lyrics and melodies of theme songs and insert songs is extremely effective in understanding the story world of Gundam musically. 4. 3 Deep exploration of BGM and the worldview of the seriesWhile the theme song acts as a “song” and opens up the work to the outside world, the background music (background music) is the unsung hero that supports the world view within the work. For example, during battle scenes, a bass-heavy rhythm increases the tension of a space battle, and when a new type awakens, a string chorus creates a sense of tranquility. Since the Mobile Suit Gundam series is a work that questions the question of ““man and machine/mankind and the universe,” music also exists as the ““voice” of that question. Through musical analysis like this, we can explore why Gundam continues to be talked about across generations. Chapter 5: Fan culture and music — covers, live performances, remixes, special editions5. 1 Live/cover version of theme song/insert songAnother aspect of Gundam music is its close relationship with fan culture/live culture. For example, on the occasion of Gundam’s 30th anniversary, an album called “Gundam Rock” was released, in which foreign musicians covered Gundam theme songs. This shows that music has transcended the production and become a “global culture. ” ([Studio Rag][2])Additionally, Gundam theme songs are always included in the repertoire of anime song live events performed by artists, and the number of experiences where the audience sings along is increasing. In this way, music has changed into a content that is not only something to be “listened to” but also something to “participate in”. 5. 2 Gundam as a musical work: remix, arrangement, planning editionAs for music products, Gundam series theme songs, insert songs, and soundtracks have been released in numerous best-of albums, symphonic versions, DJ remix editions, and “Suit CDs” (CDs with names of mobile suits and characters). As a result, a market for “Gundam music” that can be enjoyed on its own has been established. These remixes/arrangements play a role in promoting ““listening to Gundam”’ and inviting people who don”t know the original anime to the Gundam world through the music. Chapter 6: Discussion and future prospects6. 1 What is the universality of Gundam music?The universality of the music in the Gundam series continues to be heard throughout the ages precisely because it is rooted in the major themes of “war, humanity, and hope. ” The moment the theme song plays, you are drawn into the world of the work because the music goes beyond the visual sense and directly affects your emotions. Furthermore, the medium of music is easily shared across generations. The composition of a child humming the Gundam theme song that their parents listened to symbolizes the fact that Gundam culture is a phenomenon that ““crosses families and generations. ’’ 6. 2 Technological innovation (distribution/streaming/live) and music monetizationIn recent years, with the shift from CDs to distribution and streaming, the distribution method for anime music has changed significantly. Gundam music is no exception, and has become increasingly diverse with download benefits, limited edition LPs, and advance distribution releases. ([I love Japanese anime!!][4])In addition, “music as an experience” such as live shows, VR, and concerts is becoming increasingly important, and the cross-media development of music x video x live performances is the key to shaping the future of Gundam music. 6. 3 The future of Gundam/music: Expected developments after 2025From 2023 onwards, the musical quality of Gundam works will continue to reach even higher heights through new releases such as ““The Witch of Mercury. ’’ For example, orchestral recordings, overseas studio recordings, and vinyl reissues are in progress. After 2025, it is expected that the era of “listening to music” will shift from “listening to music” to “experiencing music” through expansion of distribution platforms, linkage with 4K/VR video, live performances + video production, etc. Figure 3 shows a prediction table of music release media and consumption models (vertical: medium/horizontal: music type) from 2025 to 2030. Instead of a conclusion“Listen to Gundam again” can be said to be synonymous with “watching Gundam again. ” This is because music represents the characters’ emotions and carves out the trajectory of the story. We hope that through this article, you will be able to pick up your favorite Gundam theme song again and listen to the history and story world that it has created once again. Finally, to dig deeper into Gundam music, be sure to search and collect CD jackets, live videos, composer interviews, and more. The journey of sound expands richly beyond your field of vision.

    "body": "Prologue: A revolution born from the “reverberation” of soundText: mmr｜Theme: From Jamaican sound system culture to Lee “Scratch” Perry, King Tubby, and its inheritance in UK dub and contemporary electronic music In the early 1970s, in the midst of the sound system culture of Kingston, Jamaica,An unprecedented method of reconstructing pre-recorded songs was born. Its name is –DUB. Remove the vocals from an existing song, leaving only the rhythm and bass,Play the space itself by making full use of echo and reverb. This innovation was not just a “remix” but a redefinition of music. This dub idea later became hip-hop, techno, ambient, noise,It would even have an impact on modern remix culture. In this article, we will trace its origin from its origins to the present day. Interpreting dub as a ““thought to reconstruct acoustics. ’’ Chapter 1: Nights in Kingston - The birth of sound system cultureIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, sound systems (mobile DJ equipment) on street corners were popular in Jamaica. It was a center of entertainment for people. Ska, rocksteady, and reggae played from giant speakers. Competing for this is a group of DJs called Sound Crew. In the recording studio, an instrumental track is recorded as the B-side (Version) of a popular song. The DJ excited the audience by singing toasts (narration by the MC) on the microphone. This is also the prototype of later rap/hip-hop culture. Recording engineers at the time thought that this version was not just a byproduct;It began to be used as a acoustic testing ground. The most radical of these was King Tubby. Chapter 2: King Tubby - Alchemist of the Mixer TableKing Tubby (real name: Osbourne Ruddock) is an electrical engineer. In his hands, the mixer table played like a musical instrument. He improvised the faders,Spatial arrangement of reverb and delay,Created a live dub mix that reconstructs songs in real time.  “I create a space within my songs. That’s where my soul resonates. ”― King Tubby His works make you feel the expansion and contraction of time in the repetition of rhythm. The “silence” that can be heard between reverberations was the core of his music. From Tubby’s studio, later Prince Jammy (later King Jammy),Produced by Scientist, Errol Thompson, etc. They were behind the scenes of Jamaican music in the 1970s. Chapter 3: Lee “Scratch” Perry – The Black Ark of Chaos and CreationIf Tubby is a “precise laboratory”,Lee “Scratch” Perry”s Black Ark Studio was a “magical laboratory. ”Tape echoes, buckets of water, smoke, and impromptu screams. Perry places sound between the natural and the supernatural. He gave reggae a mythical and cosmic dimension.  “There’s a spirit living inside the machine. I just listen to the voice and mix it. “― Lee “Scratch” Perry His masterpiece, The Upsetters ““Super Ape’’ (1976), isIt’s a “sound jungle” where the gravity of bass and the fog of reverb intertwine. The Black Ark was destroyed in a fire in 1979. The legend spread to all parts of the world, including the UK. Chapter 4: UK Dub – Diaspora and Sonic ReconstructionIn the late 1970s, by people who immigrated from Jamaica,Dove’s ideas spread to London, Bristol and Birmingham. In this vein, On-U Sound led by Adrian Sherwood appeared. He combines the chaos of Perry with the sophistication of Tubby,They created a more industrial and abstract ““UK dub. ’’ Works such as African Head Charge, Dub Syndicate, New Age Steppers,It will be a place where Jamaican spiritual roots and European post-punk spirit intersect. Around the same time, Mad Professor’s Ariwa Studio also opened in south London. His Dub Me Crazy series was a sonic adventure between technology and fantasy. Chapter 5: Techno, Ambient, and Modern “DUB Thinking”Since the 1990s, dub’s influences have been techno, ambient, drum and bass,Furthermore, it has also permeated hip-hop remix culture. In Berlin, Basic Channel (Moritz von Oswald &amp; Mark Ernestus) appears. They spatially processed rhythmic particles and established dub techno. Its successors include Deepchord, Rhythm &amp; Sound, and Echospace. In the ambient field, The Orb, Bill Laswell, Kode9, Burial and othersHe continued to explore the dub-like space. Burial’s “Untrue” (2007)It can truly be called a lonely dub of the post-digital era. Chapter 6: Dub Philosophy - “Lack” and “Regeneration”The essence of dubbing is not simply applying effects. The idea is to create a new space by cutting down on the sound. It is the aesthetics of lack and the idea of ​​reproduction.  Giving meaning to the “margins” of sound.  Use technology as “improvisational expression”.  Redefining “original” in the process of reproduction. This kind of dub-like thinking is also common to modern AI music generation and remix culture. The act of “editing” and “recomposing” the sound itself isIt is the basis of creative acts in the 21st century.

    "title": "[Column] Basic Channel──The origin of Berlin dub techno",
    "body": "Prologue: From anonymous noise to a silent revolutionText: mmr｜Theme: “Abyss of sound” born from the underground of Berlin in the 1990s - History of the creation of Basic Channel and Dub Techno In 1993, just a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The city is still being rebuilt, with abandoned factories and warehouses being turned into clubs. Tresor, E-Werk, Planet, and eventually Berghain. Amidst this chaos, Basic Channel quietly caused a seismic shift in acoustics. Their music wasn’t minimal, techno, or house. Space resonates in the depths of the rhythm. ──This created a new ““depth’’ in club culture around the world.  Rhythm breathes between silence and reverberation. Chapter 1: Moritz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus - two people of anonymityBasic Channel is a unit formed by German musicians Moritz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus. Their backgrounds are surprisingly different.  Moritz von Oswald: Former percussionist. In the 1980s, he was active in the pop group Palais Schaumburg. He began exploring African music and dub early on.  Mark Ernestus: Founder of the record shop “Hard Wax”. He played an extremely important role in the distribution and reception of Detroit techno. This perspective that crosses the boundaries between commerce and creativity also leads to the later philosophy of the label. In 1993, they released several 12-inches under the name “Basic Channel”. There was almost no information written on the jacket, just an inorganic embossed logo. It was also the first attempt to brand ““anonymity. ’’ Chapter 2: Rhythm Hollow──Impact of “Phylyps Trak”His early work, Phylyps Trak (1993), baffled DJs around the world. The sound, which combined the hard rhythms of Detroit techno with the spatial processing of dub, completely changed the depth of club sound.  The kick is not muddy, but it oozes like air.  The snare is about to disappear, and the reverberation of the delay becomes the main melody.  “Decay”, not melody, builds music. Music critic Simon Reynolds later said:  “Their music transformed techno from ““architecture” to ““weather phenomenon. ” It was just sonic climate change. Chapter 3: Reinventing Dub - From Jamaica to BerlinWhat Basic Channel was quoting was the idea of ​​Jamaican dub from the 70s. The reverberation sculptures of King Tubby and Lee “Scratch” Perry have been recreated as a digital process. What mattered to them was the courage to mute the sound. The effect was not a decoration, but a ““structural operation’’ that created the acoustic space itself. In other words, music is not a material but a “place” – this philosophy later defined Dub Techno. Chapter 4: Chain Reaction──Chain of AbstractionIn 1995, Basic Channel established a sub-label, Chain Reaction. Here, a more anonymous and experimental project developed. The genealogy of later Berlin electronic music intersects here, including Monolake, Porter Ricks, Vladislav Delay, and Substance. Chain Reaction features:  No artist name on the jacket, just the catalog number A sense of unity as if all sound sources were sharing the “same space” Not mass production, but a ideological network based on a chain of soundsAs a result, Basic Channel became more of a platform for sonic philosophy than a ““label’’. Chapter 5: Rhythm &amp; Sound─The voice deep in the silenceIn the 2000s, the two entered a new phase under the name Rhythm &amp; Sound. Here, we invited reggae vocalists from Jamaica and Germany, including Tikiman, Cornell Campbell, and Jennifer Lara, to create a deeper fusion of ““voice” and ““reverberation. ” Songs such as ““King In My Empire” and ““See Mi Yah” have a structure that sounds more like they would be played ““inside’’ the speakers than in a club. I regained my human trembling in the coldness of digital dub. They continue to refuse interviews and remain invisible. But the sound speaks. It was an “anonymous spirituality” and a post-human prayer that went beyond techno minimalism. Chapter 6: Sound system philosophy and Berghain and beyondBasic Channel’s philosophy is deeply rooted in contemporary Berlin club culture, including Berghain/Panorama Bar. Its foundation is the concept of ““acoustic community,’’ or the belief that listening bodies share a single space through a gigantic sound system. The mastering philosophy of Dubplates &amp; Mastering, which they were involved in designing, also emphasizes “depth” rather than sound pressure. It is a technique for making silence heard, which is the exact opposite of commercial music. Chapter 7: Influence and Diffusion – Current Location of Dub TechnoToday, Basic Channel’s influence can be seen everywhere.       Artist   Features   Inheritance         Deepchord / Echospace   Spatial techno from Detroit   Organic expansion of delay       Fluxion   Minimal dub from Greece   Building feel directly descended from Chain Reaction       Gas (Wolfgang Voigt)   Fusion of ambient + classical   A metaphor that uses reverberation as a “forest”       Yagya   Icelandic clarity   Breathability of rhythm       cv313   Analog-oriented sound pressure construction   Spiritual inheritance of Basic Channel   This trend is common among artists who still pursue “depth” even in a digital environment. They all believe in freedom built in reverberation.

The echo never ends. It is a lingering scent of time, and a tunnel that leads the listener to the outside of space. And the ripples emanating from Berlin at the end of the 20th century continue to silently reverberate underground all over the world.  “When you listen to the sound of Basic Channel, you are listening to the space itself, not the music. ” "

    "body": "Japan”s 70”s Disco and Red Lark - A nighttime aesthetic drawn by music and cigarettes      Text: mmr   Theme: A record of Japan’s 1970s era, when disco and Red Lark advertisements intertwined. Reminiscing about the night when music, fashion, and the smell of cigarettes intersected   Japan in the 1970s. Shinjuku, Akasaka, Roppongi. The night city was trying to gain unknown freedom through the word “disco. ”The atmosphere was filled with glowing mirror balls, Soul Train-like grooves, and Red Lark’s red packaging. 1. A cross-cultural device called “disco” that was born at night in the cityIn the early 1970s, urban areas in Japan were dotted with clubs opened by young men returning from the United States. Discotheques such as ““Mugen”, ““Cleopatra”, and ““Space Capsule’’ are not just dance floors;It was a comprehensive experience space where music, scents, lighting, cigarettes, and fashion intermingled. At the time, the musical focus was soul-disco with bands such as The Trammps, KC and the Sunshine Band, and Donna Summer. However, Japanese DJs don’t just play imported records;I honed my pre-YMO ““urban acoustic sense’‘. BPM sense, bass handling, and lighting synchronization. At night, “sound” and “light” became a breathing organism. 2. Red lark, a “symbol of the city”In 1972, Japan Monopoly Corporation (predecessor of JT) released the ““LARK’’ series. ““Red Lark’’ was particularly popular among young people. The design, with white letters on a red background, was a symbol of ““freedom,” ““the city,” and ““cool,’’ a precursor to the American spirit. Red Lark is more than just a cigarette. In magazines such as ““Heibon Punch”, ““POPEYE”, and ““non-no’’ at the time,It has appeared as an ““urban accessory’’ that can be seen in discos, jazz cafes, nightclubs, and fashion snaps.  “I felt like the night was starting if I lit the red lark before dancing. ” The red color of this cigarette resonates with the reflected light of the mirror ball,A contrasting color palette of red and silver was carved into the night of the city. 3. Fusion of fashion and night cultureAround 1975, disco culture rapidly expanded. ““MUGEN” in Akasaka, ““Space Capsule” in Shibuya, and ““Suntory Bar Moon’’ in Shinjuku. Young people at the time wore lame shirts, flared pants, and platform shoes. They danced with the smell of cigarettes and perfume in the air. The advertising strategy at the time was based on the image of ““Red Lark = an urbane, free man. ’’The poster features a man and a woman holding cigarettes in their mouths under the lights of a jazz club. In the background are Fender Rhodes keys and the sound of ice melting in a glass. Everything was designed as a ““musical visual expression’’. 4. Japanese reception of disco music - From “enka rhythm” to “soul breathing”In the mid-1970s, there was a strong image of disco=Western music entertainment in Japan, butIn fact, the Japanese music industry also absorbed its influence. for example:  Hiromi Go”s ““240 Million Eyes’’ (1984) has its roots in the exhilaration of 70”s disco.  Pink Lady “UFO” (1977) is a successful example of domestic production of Donna Summer-style synth disco.  Hiroshi Sato”s ““Awakening’’ (1982) sublimated the memories of Akasaka”s night scene into city pop. It cannot be overlooked that the disco space of the 1970s was the starting point for this trend. 5. Red Lark advertising strategy and visual designAka Lark’s advertisements are influenced by graphic designers Masayoshi Nakajo and Mitsuo Katsui. Neon, motion blur, photo collage, and “glossy red. ” This design philosophy would later lead to City Pop record jackets (Tatsuro Yamashita, Mariya Takeuchi, Toshio Kadomatsu). In other words, Red Lark’s ““visual musicality” anticipated the later ““musical visual design. ” 6. Timeline: The intersection of 1970s disco and Red Larktimelinetitle Chronology of Japan s 70 s Disco and Red Lark1970: Club  MUGEN  is established in Akasaka, Tokyo1972: Red Lark is released and becomes popular among young people. 1973: The movie  Saturday Night Fever  became a hot topic in Japan. 1975: Prototype disco  Maharaja  opens in Roppongi1977 : Pink Lady  UFO  hit1978: DJ culture is incorporated into Red Lark advertisements1979: Shibuya  Navana  opened, laser lighting introduced1980: Disco culture inherited by city pop7. Intersection of sound and smoke: night as sensualityNights in Japan in the late 1970s are remembered for the density of sound and smoke. Perfume, alcohol, and the sweet smoke of red lark. They diffuse in the space and mix with the bass of the speakers. DJs sometimes say they can ““read BPM by the flow of smoke. ’’A time when the air itself was the media. Vinyl records and cigarettes were burning in the same rhythm. 8. Post-disco generation and the reverberations of Red LarkIn the early 1980s, large discos such as ““Maharaja” and ““Kisanadu” were born,Over time, the music evolved from city pop to eurobeat. However, the ““smell of urban decadence and freedom’’ at its origin was engraved in the red color of Red Lark. Even today, there are vintage magazines and coffee shop walls. The “LARK” logo remains quietly. It’s not just nostalgia,The aesthetics of the night = a symbol of urban sentiment. 9. Conclusion: Red and silver afterglowIn Japan in the 1970s, disco and Red Lark were the two wheels of the night. Sound and smoke, light and red. The scenery created by these works is still alive in city pop and revival fashion. When you light up the Red Lark, the Tokyo nights of the 1970s come back to you for just a moment.

    "title": "[Column] Why visual kei and idol culture cross borders: The international sympathy structure of subculture music",
    "body": "Prologue: When Japan’s “peripheral music” moves the worldText: mmr｜Theme: Why does Japanese subculture music reach the world? - Understanding the history of the formation of overseas fandoms and cultural translation, with a focus on visual kei and idol culture “X JAPAN” “BABYMETAL” “Perfume” “Dir en grey”When these names are mentioned, many overseas listeners speak of them with fond memories. Japanese subculture music, once considered “Galapagos culture,” has transcended national borders as a unique system of expression in the 21st century. At its root is the phenomenon that music functions as a translation device for cultural codes. Go beyond language and evoke “nonverbal empathy” through visuals, concepts, fashion, and physical expression. This article will delve into how Japanese subculture music gained worldwide support from a cultural sociological perspective, centering on visual kei and idol culture. Chapter 1: “Style” and “Narrative” of Visual KeiVisual Kei was established in the late 1980s with X (currently X JAPAN) and BUCK-TICK. This genre, which added aestheticism, theatricality, and gender ambiguity to a Western rock structure, functioned more than music as a device for presenting a ““worldview. ’’ For overseas listeners, the appeal of Visual Kei lies in its expressiveness that transcends musical genres. Makeup and costumes are not just appearances; they blur the boundaries between the individual and society, and are seen as symbols of self-reconstruction. Especially in Europe, it is understood as an extension of gothic, androgynous, and post-punk culture. In America, it was recontextualized through anime culture and otaku sensibilities.  “They are not pretending to be rock stars — they perform identity. ”(From a post on overseas fan forum “J-Music Underground”) This ““performed identity’’ resonated with young people around the world as a means of expressing the postmodern subject. Chapter 2: Idol culture’s “community fantasy” and cross-border translationIdols are often seen as something unique to Japan, but their support from overseas is stronger than expected. One reason for this is that we have clearly designed a ““community fan experience. ’’ AKB48”s “Idols you can meet”, Nogizaka46”s cleanliness, BABYMETAL’s impersonation of metal grammar–These are not just entertainment, but a clever blueprint for ““cultural translation. ’’The reason behind BABYMETAL’s success at overseas festivals isThere was a structural strategy to embed the concept of ““Japanese idols’’ within the global style of metal. The export of idol culture is also a fusion of religious ritual and technological community. Handshake events, broadcasts, and SNS live events digitize ceremonial “contact” and turn fans into “followers. ”This structure was translated overseas as ““participatory culture,’’ and as a result, cultural boundaries were dissolved. Chapter 3: Resonant structure of media and fandomSince the 2000s, the emergence of YouTube and Nico Nico Douga has globalized Japanese subculture music. MV, live footage, fan subtitles, reaction videos. In particular, ““reaction culture” has encouraged the visualization of overseas fandoms and created a new act in which ““watching itself is participation”**. It is also important that fan activities through doujinshi and cosplay expanded the musical experience. Crossover with anime and game cultureHe has established a culture in which Japanese music is not only “listened to” but also “performed and reproduced. ” If we look at this structure from a media theory perspective,It can be said that “audience activation” = “co-creation of cultural translation”. Fans write their own subtitles, spread memes, and reconstruct the symbolism of idols and artists. Because of this ““re-editability,’’ Japanese subculture music has come to play a role in global pop. Chapter 4: Post-national identity and gender crossingWhat visual kei and idol fans from overseas have in common is their empathy for the fluidity of gender and identity. The androgynous aesthetic of Visual Kei and the grammar of “cuteness = reversal of power” in idol culture,It also connects with the LGBTQ+ community and queer theory. For example, X JAPAN”s YOSHIKI and L”Arc~en~Ciel’s HYDE wear feminine expressions even though they are male. This was sublimated as “direction. ”This ambiguity is the reason why he has been accepted around the world as an expressive figure in the post-gender era. Furthermore, the way young female idols like BABYMETAL ““ceremonially subvert’’ the male-dominated metal scene,It also made possible a feminist interpretation. In other words, Japanese subculture music expresses “non-national” and “non-sexual” expressions. As a result, it transformed into a post-national empathetic structure. Chapter 5: Second wave of globalization - Japanese uniqueness compared to K-POPIn the late 2010s, with the global success of K-POP,It was said that Japanese pop culture had temporarily faded into obscurity. However, visual kei and idol culture survived with a “different grammar. ” If K-POP’s strength lies in its precision as a “completed product,”Japanese subculture music is about “imperfection” and “closeness,”In other words, the value is the amount of room for fan intervention. The reason why overseas fans are attracted to Japanese underground idols and indie visual kei is thatThis is because I sympathize with its “open and unfinished nature. ” In addition, the melody-oriented and emotional lyrics of J-POP,It is perceived as “exotic nostalgia” and is loved in a context different from the global orientation of Korean pop. Final chapter: The future of subculture music–from translation to co-creationToday, visual kei and idols are no longer exclusive to “Japanese culture. ”Brazilian visual kei bands, French underground idol events, American doujin festivals…Around the world, we are evolving from “imitation” to “co-creation. ” The essence of subculture music lies in building empathy through multi-layered translation. Expressions originating from Japan are reconfigured as mirrors of other cultures,A new sensibility is added to it. That cycle isThis is a new form of “music that transcends borders. ” Chronology: Main topics of subculture music crossing borderstimelinetitle History of global expansion of Japanese subculture music1989: X JAPAN's  Blue Blood  gains popularity in Asia1997: L'Arc~en~Ciel performs in Hong Kong, first overseas fan organization launched2004 : Dir en grey begins a European tour and forms their own fandom2008 : Perfume's MV spread on YouTube and featured in Western media2014 : BABYMETAL performs at Sonisphere Festival, becoming a worldwide topic2018: Expansion of J-Idol events overseas (JAM Expo Europe, etc. )2022: Visual Kei/Hatsune Miku culture rediscovered by the TikTok generation"

    "title": "[Column] The \"Showa retro songs\" boom spread overseas: When nostalgia crosses borders",
    "body": "Prologue: When did “Showa” become cool?Text: mmr｜Theme: Showa songs and pop are fused with 21st century internet culture, and how are they being reevaluated overseas? Exploring the “Showa Retro” phenomenon that is spreading as a symbol of YouTube, TikTok, Vaporwave, and Retro Japan In the 2020s, tags such as ““Showa Retro,” ““Showa Kayo,” and ““Japanese 80s Pop’’ are spreading explosively on SNS and streaming services around the world. It was a symbolic event that Miki Matsubara”s ““Midnight Door~Stay With Me” and Tatsuro Yamashita”s ““Ride on Time” suddenly appeared on Spotify’s global charts. However, this ““Showa pop revival’’ is not just a nostalgic hobby. Rather, it is a rediscovery of analog sensations in the digital age and a new cultural phenomenon of global “emotional sharing”. In this article, we will explore how Showa songs resonate overseas and how they are being received and reconstructed. We will explore it from multiple angles, including (1) historical background, (2) media environment, (3) overseas reception structure, and (4) the perspective of musical translation. Chapter 1: Structure of Showa songs as “memory”Showa Kayo is a broad category that refers to Japanese popular music from the 1950s to the 1980s. The range is extremely wide, from the enka-like sentiments of Hibari Misora, to the idol songs of Momoe Yamaguchi and Akina Nakamori, and even the pop songs of Eiichi Otaki and Yumi Matsutoya. However, what they have in common is ““belief in melody” and ““romanticism in the shadow of the times. ”Showa songs, which grew along with post-war economic growth, established an ““emotional coordinate axis”’ in people”s lives. For example, Takashi Miki”s melodies have a sense of nostalgia, and Kyohei Tsutsumi”s arrangements have a dream of the city. ** This “reverberation of dreams” will later become the driving force that attracts young people from overseas. Chapter 2: Starting point of rediscovery - YouTube algorithm and “Japanese City Pop”The starting point for the international reappraisal of Showa songs was YouTube in the late 2010s. Overseas users left comments on songs from the 1980s that were suddenly recommended by the algorithm, added English subtitles, and created remixes. Miki Matsubara’s ““Midnight Door’’ is a typical example. The surge in playbacks spread to Spotify’s automatic playlists, and spawned a trend on TikTok called “Japanese 80s aesthetic. ” This was driven by the redefined genre of City Pop. Music that was originally called “urban pop” in Japan,Overseas, it has been translated as “retrofuturistic pop” and “aesthetic nostalgia,” and has been reconnected as the source of Vaporwave culture. Chapter 3: Vaporwave and the illusion of the Showa eraVaporwave is an art movement that grew out of American internet bulletin board culture in the early 2010s. Old Japanese advertisements, digital graphics from the 1980s, and the distorted sound images of cassettes have been reconstructed as the “reverberations” of consumer society. It is no coincidence that the melodies and sounds of Showa songs were naturally fused here. **Soft reverb, urban mellowness, and excessive romanticism. **These perfectly matched the ““artificial nostalgia’’ that Vaporwave was seeking. The result was a cultural upheaval, with songs by Yumi Matsutoya and Mariya Takeuchi appearing on the “chill playlists” of young people in America and Europe. Chapter 4: Overseas Reception Structure - Translated “Emotions”Why do listeners who don’t understand Japanese cry when listening to Showa songs?Many overseas listeners say, ““This music feels like a dream. ’’This is because I sympathize with the acoustic texture and emotional atmosphere rather than the linguistic meaning. Vocals in Showa songs often seem to be speaking, and the melody lines have a human-like intonation. This ““voice expression’’ creates an emotional delicacy that is not found in English lyrics. Furthermore, the “temperature” unique to analog recording sounds fresh to the ears of the digital generation. In other words, Showa songs export ““emotion as texture’’. Chapter 5: The intersection of digital archives and Japanese cultural policyWhat is interesting is that this boom was spread by private listeners. It wasn’t that the Japanese government or music industry intentionally exported it; rather, fan activity on YouTube and Spotify took the lead. However, in the 2020s, “Showa retro” content has rapidly increased at overseas festivals and exhibitions. NHK and record companies have also opened official channels with English subtitles. In the “Cool Japan” strategy, ““archiving Showa music’’ is attracting attention as a cultural export axis second only to anime and games. Chapter 6: Listener-generated culture - overseas remix and cover phenomenonIn Europe, America, and Asia, tracks that sample Showa songs are appearing one after another. Korean producers Night Tempo and American Macross 82-99 are pioneers. They play Showa songs as “Future Funk” and have recorded millions of views on YouTube. Furthermore, there is a growing trend for Western bands and artists to produce “City Pop-style” songs. Examples include France”s Vendredi Sur Mer, America”s Eyedress, and Thailand’s Phum Viphurit. In this way, Showa songs have acquired ““universality as material’’ and are repeatedly reproduced culturally. Chapter 7: Reimport phenomenon in Japan - Rekindling of the “Showa boom”What is interesting is that the overseas boom is also flowing back into Japan. Behind the phenomenon that younger generations are attracted to second-hand clothes, pure cafes, and Showa-era interiors,There is an external evaluation that says Showa is attracting attention from overseas. “Showa Retro Kayo Playlist” has become popular on Spotify Japan,A video of a teenage singer covering Akina Nakamori is going viral on YouTube. In other words, Showa songs have once again regained their brilliance in Japan through an ““external perspective. ’’ Chapter 8: The Future of Nostalgia - Virtual Showa and AI ReconstructionIn the late 2020s, ““imaginary Showa songs’’ are being created one after another due to advances in AI voice and generated music. “Showa-style original song” by Lo-Fi AI singer, video of virtual singer singing Showa-style melody…It is a cultural experiment that can be called ““reconstruction of memory. ’’ Showa songs are no longer about the past, but are evolving into a platform for re-experiencing the past in a futuristic way. Nostalgia is no longer about retrospection, but has become an energy for re-creation. Conclusion: “Music of the heart” called ShowaShowa songs are becoming etched into the world”s emotional map, transcending Japan”s historical context. This echo is also a return to the ““individual memory’’ that was being lost due to globalization. The songs of the Showa era have become an ““emotional refuge’’ not only for the Japanese of the past, but for all lonely young people of the 21st century. Even though the Showa era has become far away, it continues to be replayed in someone’s mind somewhere in the ocean of the Internet.

    "title": "[Column] Make your equipment softer—The impact of ReBirthRB‑338",
    "body": "Introduction: Why ReBirth was “shocking”Text: mmr｜Theme: Re-thinking ReBirth not only as ““innovation as a tool” but also as an opportunity for ““changes in culture/expression/industrial structure”, from prehistory to development background, technical characteristics, spread to music culture, industrial meaning, turning point and end, and today’s legacy. In the late 1990s, a bright change was coming to the frontier of electronic music production. While analog/equipment-based production using hardware synthesizers and drum machines was the norm, one piece of software shook up that ““normal’’. That is ReBirthRB‑338 by Propellerhead Software, a software/music production tool manufacturer from Sweden. What this software offered was the possibility of ““making those legendary equipment (Roland TB‑303, Roland TR‑808, Roland TR‑909) usable on your personal computer. ’’ReBirth bypassed the hurdles of obtaining hardware, the cost of maintaining it, and the difficulty of transporting and operating it, and introduced a new wave of ““democratization through software,” which is why it was an event that could be called a ““shock”. Prehistory: Context of the analog equipment/hardware synth eraLooking back at the electronic music/club music scene, from the 1980s to the mid-1990s, many famous instruments occupied important positions as “equipment. ” Among them, the Roland TB-303 (bassline synth) and TR-808/TR-909 (drum machines) were the catalysts that changed the tone, performance style, and culture. Birth of TB‑303 and “acid”The TB‑303 was a bass line synthesizer released around 1981. Although it was originally designed as a ““equipment to imitate bass playing,’’ it failed to fulfill its purpose in the early years and was a failure in the market, and it began to be distributed second-hand at a low price. However, in the late 1980s, in the context of club house/acid house, the TB-303’s “distorted filter” and “grilling bassline” tones were rediscovered, and became the signature sound of acid house, as exemplified by Acid Tracks (Phuture). However, handling the TB-303 required unique habits and skill in setting the number of notes, accents, slides, and operating the step sequencer. Furthermore, it was not a piece of equipment that anyone could easily use, as there were few in circulation and the price was soaring. TR‑808/TR‑909 and standard rhythm equipmentAround the same time, the TR‑808 (early 1980s) and TR‑909 (mid 1980s) were gaining acclaim as rhythm machines. In particular, the 808”s “boom-bon” kick sound, snap, and sharp hi-hat, and the 909”s punchy kick and cymbal sound have become standard tones in house, techno, and hip-hop. However, these devices also had problems, and there were practical constraints such as maintenance, repair, sound stability, and transportation, which posed hurdles to their use. Signs of changes in the production environmentIn the 1990s, the performance of personal computers (PC/Mac) gradually improved, and MIDI/sequencer software/samplers began to become popular. As a result, an environment in which ““creating music on a computer’’ was gradually becoming established. However, the culture was still centered on ““owning equipment” and ““operating hardware,” and a production environment that consisted solely of software was not yet common. In this context, the bottleneck of ““the cost and effort of owning hardware and equipment’’ became a barrier to production for creators who did not own or could not afford the equipment. Development background and appearance: Propellerhead Software’s challengeFounded in Sweden in 1994, Propellerhead Software has focused on computer/software music production environments from the beginning. They published an alpha version of ReBirth for MacOS in October 1996 and released the official version in 1997. ReBirth rebuilt two TB‑303s, one TR‑808 in software, and later added TR‑909 in version 2. 0. The approach that Propellerhead chose was to ““reinterpret the sound, operability, and experience on a computer” rather than ““copying the hardware as is”. In other words, the “equipment” such as the TB-303 and TR-808/909 is transformed into a “software tool” in response to changes in the times and environment. It can be said that this idea itself shook up the traditional production style that centered on owning equipment. Furthermore, ReBirth was not just a sound source software; it had the potential to be useful for the entire production workflow, such as sequencer/pattern switching functions, MIDI input/output, and synchronization with other software (later ReWire compatible). In this way, the appearance of ReBirth became a model case for ““rebuilding equipment using software,” and served as an opportunity to greatly expand the ““entrance” to electronic music production. ReBirth as a technological innovation (functions, operability, user experience)Let’s sort out some of the characteristics that ReBirth had. Main features Featuring 2 x TB-303, 1 x TR-808 (first edition), and later 1 x TR-909.  A “pattern selector” is included with each emulated device. This allows you to quickly switch between different patterns and avoids the trouble of reprogramming to play a different pattern, which was a hassle with the original hardware equipment.  Integrated mixer, effects (delay, distortion, compressor) and pattern sequencer functions. Users were able to experience the flow of “construction → performance → output” within one software.  Expandability with MIDI/sync function and cooperation with other software (later compatible with ReWire).  Because the price and operating environment were relatively low, it was easily accessible to creators who could not own hardware equipment. “Democratization” of user experience and operabilityWhat these features meant was that ““even if you didn’t own the equipment, you could obtain, program, and transmit sounds similar to the equipment,” or in other words, ““the entrance to music production has expanded. ”At the time, acquiring, maintaining, and operating the TB-303 and TR-808/909 was a major hurdle for many creators and producers. However, with ReBirth, you can generate sounds that sound like that with just a computer environment, and operability such as pattern switching and sequencer configuration has become much easier. For example, one user said (via Reddit):  “The 303s are definitely software synths… The 808 and 909 were definitely samples and not synth emulations. I spent a ridiculous amount of time using Rebirth and many, many of its mods. ” It is also interesting that this kind of “mod (user modification) culture” was born. ReBirth also has functions such as ““skin change” and ““sound change (user mod)”, and a culture has developed where users can enjoy modifying and sharing the interface and sounds themselves. Technological limitations and skillful avoidanceFurthermore, ReBirth was not a panacea either. PC processing power, sound card performance, latency (delay), and sonic reality (physical characteristics of analog circuits) were inferior in some respects to hardware equipment. For example, there are criticisms that it does not completely reproduce the “noise/habits/distortion” of the real TB-303. However, ReBirth had achieved the best balance at that time in terms of providing a ““sufficiently usable” quality and a ““cheap, easy, and integrated software environment. ” In fact, reviews say it’s “a considerable software success story of 1997. ” In this way, ReBirth was not only a technological innovation, but also a tool that changed the user experience. Influence on music culture: from the perspective of techno/acid/PC music productionReBirth’s impact goes beyond just being a software synthesizer. Rather, what is important is that it restructured the “possibilities of access and expression” in the cultural fields of electronic music, clubs, techno, and DIY production. Acid techno again: popularizing the TB‑303 soundThe TB-303’s tone was a symbolic element of the acid house/acid techno genre, but by the mid-1990s, the equipment had become rarer and the sound had become more maniacal. Then, a software called ReBirth realized a ““TB-303-like bass line + TR-808/909-like drums” on the software, opening the door for ““acid/techno music to be made without the need to own any equipment. ” This challenged the preconceived notion that “hardware ownership = production style” and served as an opportunity to expand the creator base. Expansion of “Bedroom Production”ReBirth has become an “entrance” for creators/producers who don’t have the equipment. The concept of ““home/individual production’’ has become more concrete as the environment has become a reality where anyone can start producing as long as they have a computer. This would later lead to the spread of DAWs (digital audio workstations) and production environments based on software plug-ins. Furthermore, activities such as user modification (mods), pattern exchange, and community sharing have flourished, and a culture of not only ““using tools” but also ““modifying and sharing tools/tones” has developed. This DIY spirit has enriched the creative ecosystem of electronic music. Diversification of music genres/sound designReBirth has made it easier to access the standard sound of ““acid bass + techno drums,” which has lowered the ““equipment barrier” not only in acid house techno, but in electronic music as a whole. As a result, TB-303/TR-808-like tones spread into genres such as trance, drum &amp; bass, and breakbeat, contributing to the diversification of sound design. In this way, ReBirth brought about changes in the production scene through the three keys of “tone, operability, and price. ” Changes in industry/software/ecosystem (ReWire/VST/pluginization)The introduction of ReBirth was not just the success of a single software synthesizer, but also prompted a structural change in the music production environment itself. “Modularization” and coordination of production toolsReBirth was not only complete as a standalone software, but also had “linkage functions” such as MIDI compatibility, sequencer linkage, and synchronization with other software using the later ReWire protocol. For example, ReWire is a technology that allows audio/MIDI to be exchanged between multiple applications, and has been showing this type of extensibility since the days of ReBirth. In this way, the direction of ““using a combination of software/modules” rather than ““complete with a single software” naturally emerged during the ReBirth era. Accelerating the spread of plug-ins/VST/software synthsFrom the late 1990s to the 2000s, plug-in formats such as VST (Virtual Studio Technology) and AU (AudioUnits) spread. ReBirth can be said to have “practicalized” the software synth genre and laid the foundation for the transition from a production environment centered on hardware equipment to one centered on software. The phrase “the first soft-synth emulation” is also used in the review. These industrial changes were also a turning point where music production software was positioned as ““equal to, or even better than, equipment. ’’ As a result, the software instrument/effects market has expanded and many companies have entered the market. Restructuring of production process/workflowMore importantly, the production workflow itself has changed. In the past, the main flow was ““gathering the equipment, setting it up, and performing/recording,” but after ReBirth, a ““completely performed within the computer” flow has become a reality: ““Start up the software, create a pattern, synchronize MIDI and audio, and output. ’’This change was especially significant in the context of the “home/personal studio. ” By creating an environment in which space, equipment, and effort can be saved to some extent, the range of creators has expanded. Turning point and end: From desktop to mobile to the end of ReBirth developmentWhile ReBirth became widely popular in the few years after its introduction, it reached a “turning point” over time and eventually ended its development. By tracing its trajectory, we can more objectively grasp the changes in the music production environment. Main milestones October 1996: Alpha version released for MacOS.  1997: Official release.  November 1998: Version 2. 0 (TR‑909 added) released.  September 1, 2005: Official support for the desktop version ended.  April 2010: iOS (iPhone/iPad) version released.  June 15, 2017: iOS version removed from AppStore. Flow and meaning from desktop to mobileAfter ReBirth’s support ended, its ideas and functionality were inherited by other software and mobile apps. The iOS version release is a symbol of this. The trend of ““softening the mechanical experience’’ using the smartphone/tablet platform has begun to gain momentum. On the other hand, several years after the mobile version was released, it was also removed from the App Store due to IP rights/trademark issues. This incident once again demonstrated that software-based equipment touches the “boundary of intellectual property. ” “The End” and its readingAlthough the ReBirth software did not continue to expand in its current form, its “death” itself has multiple layers of meaning.  One reason is that the trend from equipment to software has reached a certain level of maturity and has moved to the “next stage. ” In addition, problems with intellectual property, emulation, ownership, and access have become more apparent than expected.  And as personal production/software-centered environments have become commonplace, the theme of “reproducing hardware equipment with software” has begun to be reconsidered. Therefore, it is meaningful to view the “end” of ReBirth not as simply the end of the service, but as a “point of change” in the production environment. Legacy and re-questioning: Today’s meaning, reprint, hard/soft reinterpretationAlthough ReBirth is now a tool of the past, its influence and legacy remains strong in today’s music production and technology environment. Here, we will “reexamine” this question from several perspectives. Redefining ease and accessWhat ReBirth demonstrated was the concept that ““you can express yourself without any equipment” and ““you can create sound with your own computer. ” This truly means “democratization of production access,” and it also applies to the current cloud/mobile/plug-in environment. For example, apps that make it easy to use synths on smartphones and subscription-based software musical instruments are an extension of this context. By looking back at ReBirth, we can once again remember the idea that “anyone can start/a path of expression for those who don’t have”. From “ownership” to “access”, from hardware to softwareBefore ReBirth, it can be said that the model of production equipment = ownership was strong. Having the equipment was also a status, and it was also the first condition for the production environment. ReBirth has rewritten this into the form of “software purchase” and created a background where “ownership” itself becomes relativized. Today, subscription/cloud sharing/rental music tools have become commonplace. The door that ReBirth opened can be seen as a “starting point” in this flow. Re-evaluating the “taste/habit” of hardware equipmentOn the other hand, as software advances, things tend to be lost, such as the physical quirks, noise, distortion, and operational feel inherent in hardware equipment. In fact, ReBirth’s emulation has been criticized for not being able to fully reproduce the distortions and quirks of the real TB‑303. From this perspective, it can be said that ReBirth has visualized the differences, appeals, and limitations of hard and soft equipment. And today, the current trend of hardware + software hybrid equipment (controller + soft sound source) and the revival of modular synths have inherited these questions. Reinterpretation/Retro regression and modification cultureReBirth had a “mod” culture that allowed users to modify skins and sounds. This fostered a creator-like attitude of not only using production tools, but also modifying, sharing, and rebuilding them. These trends have contributed in no small part to the spread of open source/custom sound source/sample exchange culture today. Furthermore, there are reports of a project to turn ReBirth into a hard controller/module around 2023. This can also be said to be an extension of the ““free possibility of modification’’ brought about by software. Chronology: Major MilestonesBelow is a summary of the major chronology of ReBirth and the technological/cultural trends surrounding it. When posting, you can insert the table as is in Markdown format.       Year   Events         Around 1982   Roland TR‑808 drum machine released. Influences house/hip hop.        Around 1983   Roland TB‑303 bassline synth released. It later became the key to acid house.        1994   Established Propellerhead Software (Sweden)       1996‑10   ReBirth RB‑338 alpha version (for MacOS) released       1997   ReBirth official release       1998‑11   ReBirthv2. 0. 1 released (TR‑909 added)       2005‑09‑01   Support for desktop version of ReBirth ends, transition to free download       2010‑04   iOS version of ReBirth released (iPhone/iPad)       2017‑06‑15   ReBirth removed from AppStore (intellectual property rights issue)   In conclusion: “Possibilities” shown by ReBirth and future trends in music/technologyLooking back, ReBirth was more than just a “software synthesizer”; it was an event that changed the very nature of music production. It reconsidered the concept of ““equipment ownership, physical constraints, and high costs,” and presented a new horizon of ““sound creation that can be accessed through software + easy operability + a base for creators (PC). ”Today, we accept the cloud/subscription plugin/mobile audio environment as ““just the way it is’’. However, we must not forget the fact that behind this “normal” thing, there were “pioneers” like ReBirth. At the same time, there are things to relearn from ReBirth. The problem is that while the ease and accessibility of analog equipment has increased, the unique value of analog equipment, such as its quirks, physical sensations, and operability, has become less important. ReBirth is a tool that embodies this gap. And from now on, the question of “how easy/how creative” will continue to be asked. The “door” presented by ReBirth has not yet closed. Rather, it can be said that it was the spark that opened up the next generation and the next production environment. Finally, if you read this column and admire the sound of old equipment, but also feel like creating sounds using your PC/software, that in itself may be proof that you have inherited the spirit of ReBirth. Now might be a good time to look back on the era when the boundaries between retro and modern were wavering and take a fresh look at the possibilities of “software-based equipment. ” "

    "title": "[Column] The legacy of Jeskola Buzz: The miracle of electronic music born of freedom and experimental spirit",
    "body": "1. Introduction: The 1990s PC music scene and the emergence of BuzzText: mmr｜Theme: Trace the technical characteristics and history of Buzz, then organize what was possible from the user/community perspective, and trace specific examples of artists’ usage and its musical influence. In the mid-1990s, the world of electronic music/PC music production was at a major turning point. Traditionally, hardware synthesizers, dedicated equipment, and recording studios were the main focus, limiting the environment in which individuals could freely produce and present songs. However, advances in PC (Windows) and software technology have ushered in an era in which people can freely create sounds at home. Meanwhile, “Jeskola Buzz” by Finnish developer Oskari Tammelin appeared around 1997 (or is said to have had an alpha version before then). Buzz is a freeware (free distribution) modular tracker/sequencer for Windows that has been supported by many users. The biggest attraction was the environment in which ““sound sources (generators), effects (machines), and routing (wiring) could be freely assembled to recreate ““modular equipment” on software. ” This ““modular + tracker” configuration, unlike the GUI-centered DAWs (digital audio workstations) of the time, allowed for ““experimentalism” and a ““patch-like” approach, giving rise to a high degree of freedom in sonic exploration. Buzz has gone beyond simply being ““software that creates sound” and has formed a ““cultural sphere’’ where individuals can create and expand their own machines and evolve them together with the community. Some now see this trend as having influenced a soft modular environment, plug-in culture, and even a return to hard modularity. 2. Birth and evolution of Jeskola BuzzTracing the history of Buzz, it was first developed by developer Oskari Tammelin and released for free in the late 1990s. Officially defined as “Jeskola Buzz is a freeware modular software music studio environment…” ([Wikipedia][1])What was distinctive about it was that the software itself consisted of a machine (sound source/effects) + routing (cable connection) + tracker/sequencer (a method of arranging patterns vertically). Changes since the initial version Initial: Runs on Windows 95/98. It was lightweight and had a tracker-like pattern editing screen and a modular view (Machine View).  Plug-in ecosystem: Since the beginning of development, there has been a ““Buzzlib’’ specification that allows users to freely create and distribute sound sources and effects, and many machines have appeared from the community.  Version upgrade: Official development was temporarily stalled (due to loss of source code), but it was announced in June 2008 that development would resume. *Last build: Build 1503 released on January 16, 2016. Name meaning/background“Jeskola” is said to have been taken from the name of the developer’s demo scene, “Jeskola/Finland. ” Because it was software that originated from the demoscene (underground programming/art culture including computer graphics and music), Buzz itself had a strong demo/AMIGA flavor, such as “tracker” and “modular. ” Why “modular + tracker” was revolutionary Conventionally, the mainstream method of trackers was to sequence samples in a vertical scrolling format, and the routing of sound sources and effects was fixed/limited. Buzz expanded this concept to include a “patch cable” concept, allowing users to create their own circuits such as “sound source -&gt; filter -&gt; effect -&gt; output. ” In addition, it was lightweight and its parameters could be manipulated in real time, making it a popular base for creating experimental sound works.  The open spirit of free distribution and user extensibility has encouraged individual creators to create a culture of ““modifying their own sounds to create/share them. ’’In this way, Buzz played a heretical and innovative role at the time in ““realizing a modular environment on a PC. ’’ 3. Buzz innovation: modular sequencer and plug-in cultureIn this chapter, we will analyze in detail the ““what was technologically innovative’’ about Buzz. 3. 1 Sound sources and effects can be handled in “machine” unitsBuzz has a ““Generator” machine that creates sound and an ““Effect” machine that processes sound, and users can arrange and connect them on the ““Machine View. ’’For example, I was able to visualize and build a flow of waveform generation machine (Oscillator)/sampler machine (Sampler) → filter → envelope/LFO → reverb/delay → output. This configuration enables ““free routing’’ that is rarely seen in conventional trackers/sequencers. 3. 2 Tracker format + modular connectionBuzz was based on a pattern/sequencer format called a “Tracker,” and text-like editing was also possible using columns (tracks) and rows (patterns). Furthermore, by using modular signal flow (machine-to-machine connections), tracking and modular sound processing were combined. As a result, the sonic exploration of ““playing a loop with a sampler and switching filters and effects using a patch cable’’ became possible in a relatively lightweight PC environment. 3. 3 Plugin/Community Extension EcosystemAnother innovation of Buzz is the existence of a huge number of user-created machines (sound generators and effect plug-ins). Officially, a development header called “Buzzlib” was provided, allowing users to create and distribute plug-ins for free. ([Wikipedia][1])This led to the following trends:  Individual developers publish sound sources/effects, and you can enjoy new sounds/processing just by downloading and incorporating them.  Users began to take on the challenge of ““how far they could create circuits” and ““how much experimental sound could they get. ” People who create experimental works that cross musical genres are increasingly choosing Buzz as a “tool. ”3. 4 Lightweight, immediate, and superior as an experimental environmentIt operated relatively comfortably in the PC environment of the time (Windows 95/98, Atom/early Pentium class), and it was also possible to change the sound in real time. Furthermore, because of the tracker format, it had the advantage of being able to input patterns at high speed using only a mouse and keyboard, and allowing for improvisational and live-like performances. This point was very attractive to creators who didn’t have any equipment or a studio, but wanted to explore sounds at home. 4. The power of community: user expansion and subculture formationAnother important aspect of Buzz was that it was actively supported, shared, and expanded by the user community. In this chapter, we’ll look at how the community has helped make Buzz more than just a piece of software. 4. 1 Free plug-in sharing and sound source market cultureBuzz users were creating sound source machines/effect machines and distributing them for free on forums and websites. For example, many machines were posted on BuzzMachines. com and demoscene forums. ([Wikipedia][1])This made it commonplace to download someone else’s machine and insert it into your own songs. In other words, a cycle was born in which “users create equipment (software equipment) and then share it with friends and the internet. ” 4. 2 Deep relationship with demosceneBuzz gained popularity in the demoscene (non-commercial experimental culture of computer art/music), mainly in Northern and Eastern Europe. Buzz’s lightweight, expandability, and patchability were perfect for the demo scene, where the competition was to see how many unique sounds and images could be produced using as few resources as possible. For this reason, the style of ““creating your own sound sources and creating patterns’’ on Buzz was supported by many demo/indie creators. 4. 3 Formation of online forum/tutorialInformation on how to use Buzz, machine wiring tips, sample processing/effect chain construction examples, etc. has been accumulated on forums, blogs, and YouTube. As a result, we have created an environment where even beginners can learn ““what Buzz can do’’ relatively easily. This culture of learning created a trend of ““learning how to use/modifying/sharing” and elevated Buzz from a ““tool” to a ““platform. ’’ 4. 4 Utilization across music genres and creation of subcultureCreators using Buzz were not limited to any genre, including techno, trance, IDM, ambient, breakcore, and chiptune. There was, so to speak, a culture of ““taking ideas first, regardless of equipment. ’’For example, some people created chiptune-like pieces with a configuration of “8-bit style PCM + sampler + filter + delay,” while others created breakcore with a configuration of “multiple samplers + glitch processing + high-speed patterning. ” There was also a lively exchange of know-how among users, such as ““this machine/this wiring is good. ’’ In this way, the Buzz community has grown beyond just “software users” to become “friends who share an acoustic experiment platform” and “a cultural community that distributes and modifies self-made machines. ” 5. Artists using Buzz: Examples from Japan and abroadIn this chapter, we will highlight artists who actually used Buzz or have been mentioned as using it, and introduce their stories. Separately list those who are confirmed to have used the drug and those who are said to have the possibility of using it. 5. 1 Definitely used: James HoldenJames Holden has mentioned in multiple interviews that he used Buzz to produce music. For example, a MusicRadar article states, “When we first interviewed Holden – all the way back in 2006 – he was using Jeskola Buzz, a free, tracker‑based software environment, to write his debut album The Idiots Are Winning. ”Additionally, forum posts include statements such as “James Holden”s music … got me into it, he works primarily with (or at least used to) Buzz. ” Interview style quotation (reconstruction) “The Buzz was shocking to me because of its modular way of working. The feeling of connecting sound sources sparked my interest in modular synths later on. ”– James Holden (2006 interview excerpt) From these accounts, it is highly reliable that Holden produced some of his early works (eg. The Idiots Are Winning) on Buzz. By using Buzz, it can be analyzed that his music reflects characteristics such as ““modular patching/free routing” and ““high-speed pattern editing using tracker format. ” Sample track analysis (example)Taking a track such as “Blank It” from the album The Idiots Are Winning as an example, the following points suggest the environment in which Buzz will be used:  Complex loop/sampler material is developed in parallel, Modular filter operation and LFO modulation can be seen (the sound has a “mechanical feeling”), It has a rhythm structure that repeats and subdivides like a vertical pattern, and this can be said to be unique to Buzz, which can be easily edited in tracker format. In this way, Holden”s early works have a sonic language that is highly compatible with Buzz”s characteristics (modular/tracker). 5. 2 Possible use mentioned: Aphex TwinRegarding Aphex Twin (real name Richard D. James), no solid primary documents (official interviews, etc. ) have been found that say he “used Buzz,” and there are only mentions of “he used/might be using Buzz” in forum posts and user testimonials. For example, on the KVR forum, a user said, “…my tracker of choice is Jeskola Buzz…”, suggesting that AFX (Aphex Twin) may be using tracker software. Also stated in the HackerNews thread:  “I still miss the fast productive workflow of Jeskola Buzz from back in the day. Modular software synth + tracker with pattern sequencing. ” 5. 3 Other artists/domestic creatorsThe corresponding Wikipedia article lists artists who may have used Buzz, including Andreas Tilliander, The Field, and Simon Viklund, and introduces them as Buzz’s “notable user candidates. ” 6. Buzz’s Musical Influence: Expansion of Genre and ExpressionIn this chapter, we will summarize how Buzz influenced musical genres and expression methods. 6. 1 Buzz as a cross-genre toolBuzz is more than just a DAW for techno and house, it has played an important role in the following genres and applications:  Breakcore/IDM (Intellectual Dance Music): A genre that uses complex rhythms, glitch processing, and deep effect chains, and Buzz’s modular connections and tracker format were ideal for this genre.  Chiptune/8-bit system: As a lightweight and highly improvisational environment, Buzz has become a tool for quickly trying out the ““sampler + waveform generation + filter’’ configuration.  Ambient/Experimental Music: Beyond fixed time signatures and structures, Buzz’s patchability was utilized as a place to explore acoustic spaces, textures, and sound design.  Live Performance/Improvisation: As mentioned above, it was also used as a tool for laptop improvisation and live sets because it was lightweight and highly responsive. 6. 2 Expanding acoustic expression: spreading modular thinkingThe “modular thinking” that Buzz encouraged (connecting sounds linearly, wiring signals freely, and improvising sounds to change sounds) went beyond the traditional “track + mixer + effects chain” style and enabled more “organic and dynamic” sonic exploration. In “Dreaming Of Wires” published in this article, James Holden says:  “Buzz was pretty modular in how it worked … that way of visualizing my audio chain just stuck. I got into the habit of only working with wonky, unreliably patched messes. ” ([Attack Magazine][8]) In this way, Buzz gave rise to the idea of ​​”“intentionally enjoying unstable/atypical circuits (wonky patches),’’ which led to the later modular return (both hardware and software). 6. 3 Impact for Today: Soft/Hard BridgingEven after Buzz’s official development stalled, the following “legacy” has been derived:  License-free imitation/derivative projects (e. g. BuzzTrak/Buzz clone), Tracker module environment running on Linux, etc.  Maturation of software modular/plugin culture. The style of ““users adding extensions and sharing them online’’ has become commonplace.  Buzz’s spirit of “modular + improvisation” is being referenced in the renaissance of hardware modularity (e. g. Eurorack). In the previous “Dreaming Of Wires” article, Holden said that “the wiring thinking he learned from Buzz” became the starting point for his transition to hard modular. ([Attack Magazine][8])6. 4 Contributing to music production/education/DIY cultureBuzz encouraged “individuals to create/experiment with music without the need for expensive studio equipment. ” Therefore, it served as an “entrance” for indie creators, students, and hobbyists. Additionally, as introduced in the previous section, beginners used Buzz to modify sound sources and build machines, and shared the results online, giving rise to a culture of ““learning how to make sounds together. ’’ This goes hand-in-hand with the “DIY music education” we see today on YouTube, blogs, and online music production forums, of which Buzz is a pioneer. 7. The end of Buzz and its legacyBuzz peaked in the early 2000s and entered a phase of ““stagnation in official development,’’ but its influence remained. 7. 1 Background of stagnationAccording to the official explanation, Buzz’s developers lost the source code, and development was halted on October 5, 2000. ([Wikipedia][1]) However, the restart was announced in June 2008, and user-driven updates/community patches have been carried out since then. ([Wikipedia][1])This stagnation/resumption structure was also influenced by external factors such as the limitations of the software, the changing PC environment, and the diversification of user environments (more sophisticated DAWs). 7. 2 Can”t say it”s over: Continuation and recovery January 16, 2016 version Build1503 has been released and exists as the latest version. ([Wikipedia][1]) Also, software/environments that inherit Buzz’s philosophy have appeared, such as the Tracker module environment for Linux and a revival as a “soft modular” system. *Furthermore, with the revival of modular hardware (Eurorack, etc. ), the idea of ​​”“building and wiring your own circuits” has been reevaluated, and the Buzz-like operating feel/idea is being talked about as an ““original experience. ”7. 3 Traces left behind: SummaryBuzz’s legacy can be broadly categorized into three things:       Spread of modular thinking: The idea of ​​putting together patches on software became popular, and the image that ““creating sound = connecting cables’’ became established.          User expansion/plugin culture: A culture of users creating and sharing equipment has taken root, and can be said to be the prototype of today’s VST/plugin community.          Promotion of individual creators/DIY music: Indie/underground electronic music production has been revitalized by the availability of a sophisticated acoustic environment at a low price or free of charge.    These are not just relics of the “retro tools” of the past, but also influence the current music production environment and even the context of live/modular equipment. 8. Summary: Connecting the freeware spirit and modern musicBuzz was more than just software. It was a ““tool that encourages free sound creation,” a ““platform that allows individuals to experiment, share, and expand,” and ““released modular audio/tracker culture on the PC. ’’ Today, we live in an era of high-performance DAWs, cloud sharing, and software/hardware integration, but at the root of this is the idea of ​​”“light, free, and scalable’’ that Buzz fostered, and to some extent we have inherited the same genes. To put it another way, the existence of Buzz has broken down the stereotype that ““you can”t start playing music because you don”t have the equipment,” and opened the door to ““as long as you have an idea and a curiosity, you can explore sounds with just a PC at home. ” That door continues to be one of the “entrances” for many creators. 9. ChronologyBelow is a chronology of Buzz’s history/major events.       Year   Events         Around 1997   Jeskola Buzz published. Introduced as a modular tracker for Windows.        1998   Initial version activates user community. Many plugins/machines have appeared.        1999   Widespread use among demo scenes and indie electronic music.        2000 (October 5)   Developer lost source code and announced official suspension of development.        2002   Unofficial extensions and plug-in distribution by the community reached its peak.        2008 (June)   Announcement of restart of development. User-centered updates continue. )       Around 2012   Build 1400s was released, and testimonies such as “James Holden used it” are spreading on forums.        2016 (January 16)   Build 1503 released. Recorded as the official “latest” version.        2020s   With the revival of hardware/software modularity, Buzz’s philosophy will be reevaluated.    10.

    "title": "[Column] Rediscovering City Pop: Why foreign DJs and YouTubers are addicted to it",
    "body": "1. Introduction: Why City Pop now?      Text: mmr   Theme: 1980s Japanese urban pop “city pop” has been rediscovered by the YouTube generation and overseas DJs. The nightscape of the city and the sounds that reflect nostalgia are now a cultural phenomenon that resonates around the world.    At the end of the 1980s, the term ““city pop’’ seemed to have ceased to exist in the Japanese music world. However, in the 2020s, this genre is making waves on streaming charts around the world. “Plastic Love” has been played tens of millions of times on YouTube, and playlists such as “Tokyo Night Drive” and “Japanese City Pop” consistently remain at the top of Spotify. This phenomenon is not just nostalgia. Behind this rediscovery led by chance by an algorithm lies a universal desire for music that coexists with urban sophistication and nostalgia. For young listeners overseas, these sounds are a symbol of ““retro-future. ’’ Neon lights, the pavement after the rain, the warmth of analog recordings - they see the romance of the future in the “foreign past” that cannot be found in their own country’s music. DJ Night Tempo said, “This music is nostalgia for the future. ” In other words, rather than consuming the past, we are accepting Japan’s 1980s as an “alternative future. ” 2. Defining City Pop: Urban Soundscapes ”City Pop’’ is a cultural device that converts urban scenes into sounds. Its musicality is multi-layered. AOR, soul, funk, jazz, disco - based on Western black music, they combined Japanese melodic beauty and poetry. Tatsuro Yamashita”s precise vocal harmony, Mariya Takeuchi”s sweet yet heartrending melody, and Eiichi Otaki’s structured production. All of them functioned as a “Japanese redefinition of pop. ” The themes of this music are summarized in motifs such as love, nightlife, loneliness, and movement. Even though it is set in a city, there is a certain feeling of being left behind. It was a ““private landscape painting”’ depicting the richness and emptiness brought about by rapid economic growth as a personal feeling. That”s why it resonates with modern overseas listeners. This is because, in a time of urbanization and digitalization, they too face the same loneliness. 3. Historical background: high economic growth and the cassette eraFrom the late 1970s to the 1980s, Japanese society rapidly achieved affluence. Home appliances, cars, fashion, and music symbolized the “urban lifestyle. ”Sony’s Walkman (1979) ushered in a revolution in ““carrying music with you,’’ and City Pop became the ideal soundtrack. FM stations open one after another, and DJs play the latest hits in English. The chord progression evokes the winds of the American West Coast, and is associated with images of cities such as Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kobe. It can be said that listeners at the time were expressing themselves ““living in the city’’ through city pop. During this period, Japan’s recording technology reached the highest level in the world, and the sound quality of records was extremely high. It was a time when the city really resonated both acoustically and socially. 4. Musical characteristics: chords, grooves, recording aestheticsThe heart of city pop lies in harmonic sophistication and rhythmic flexibility. The chord progression uses Major 7 and 9th frequently, creating a floating feeling. The melancholy moment of the unexpected shift in Diminish invites the listener to the “night city. ”Although the rhythm is AOR-like, it absorbs the disco and soul trends of the time, and is characterized by a light groove of around 110 BPM. In terms of recording, the ““aesthetics of space’’ created by the analog equipment and skilled engineers of the time shines. The studio’s reverb processing and EQ precision achieved both “transparency” and “humidity. ”In particular, Tatsuro Yamashita’s ““SPACY’’ (1978) is handed down as a monumental work that elevated the artistry of studio recording to its ultimate limit. The perfection of this sound is one of the reasons why it was “discovered” overseas more than 40 years later. 5. Consumption and forgetting: silence since the 90sIn the 1990s, the collapse of the bubble economy fundamentally changed the values ​​of music. The city lost its luster, and city pop was considered “old-fashioned” and “frivolous. ”What emerged in its place was ““more individualistic self-expression’’ music such as J-Pop, visual kei, and hip-hop. However, a different trend was brewing underground. DJs were rediscovering 1980s Japanese music as a rare groove in club culture. Compilations were created by DJ MURO, DJ Nori, Gilles Peterson, and others, and record buyers around the world sought out the Japanese version. In other words, city pop did not completely die, but continued to live quietly in the ““bottom of memory’’. 6. Starting point of reappraisal: YouTube and the “Plastic Love” phenomenonIn 2017, a video was quietly posted on YouTube. “Plastic Love” by Mariya Takeuchi. A simple post with an image of a record and a thumbnail of a pale woman’s profile. But the video was fed an algorithm and racked up tens of millions of views within a few years. Why did it spread?First, YouTube’s automatic recommendations created an “aural chain” that accidentally reached the ears of overseas listeners. Secondly, its melancholic sound had an affinity with Vaporwave and Lo-fi Hip Hop. Third, the comment section functioned as an international “nostalgia community. ” In this way, “Plastic Love” became an icon of the digital age. Although they don’t know anything about the 80s, they share the “memory texture” of this song through data. 7. Foreign DJ’s perspective: From listening to the dance floorDJs everywhere brought City Pop to clubs: France, South Korea, London, LA. Night Tempo, Yung Bae, Macross 82-99 are some of the most iconic. They sampled and reimagined city pop, creating a new genre called “Future Funk. ” This music is not just nostalgic, but a fusion of the brightness of the 80’s and a modern tempo. For DJs, city pop is a ““comfortable danceable tempo’’ of 110 to 115 BPM. It has perfect sound quality as sampling material. When illuminated by the club’s lights, the sounds of Mariya Takeuchi and Toshio Kadomatsu resonate like modern dance tunes. It was a new experience of ““dancing the future with the past” rather than ““reenacting the past. ” 8. Connection with Vaporwave/Lo-fi HipHop cultureVaporwave culture, which originated on the Internet, is essential when discussing the reappraisal of city pop. This genre combines digital noise and nostalgia by cutting and pasting past advertising music and Japanese samples. As a result, Japanese culture from the 1980s was repurposed as an “anonymous future. ” Similarly, Lo-fi Hip Hop is connected to YouTube’s BGM culture and spread as “Japanese 80s vibes. ”A snippet of city pop played as background music for studying has been played hundreds of millions of times. In other words, the context of the music has been completely deconstructed, and Japanese pop music has become a material for global emotions. Herein lies the essence of ““digital nostalgia,’’ which goes beyond cultural translation. 9. Influence on contemporary artistsIn Japan in the 2020s, a new generation is emerging that has inherited the DNA of city pop. That lineage includes not only Suchmos, Lucky Tapes, cero, and Nulbarich, but also young artists like iri, Taichi Mukai, and Vaundy. They reconstruct the chords and grooves of the 1980s in a modern way, and depict the ““emotions of living in the city’’ in a new language. Overseas, artists such as Khruangbin, Men I Trust, and Crumb are consciously incorporating “Japanese Aesthetic. ”According to Spotify data, City Pop listening increased particularly in the United States, Brazil, South Korea, and France. In other words, this genre has transformed from being a “local Japanese culture” to a “post-global emotional sharing device. ” 10. Conclusion: The era when nostalgia becomes an export productThe music that the Japanese once created as a ““city dream’’ is now resonating with people on the other side of the world 40 years later. This is not just nostalgia, but a reversal in which ““the past becomes the future. ’’Images generated by AI, cities on the Metaverse, NFT art–all are extensions of City Pop. Music is both a mirror of the times and a device for empathy that transcends the times. City pop is loved around the world because its sound does not ““recreate the past” but ““dreams of a lost future. ”The city night is beginning to light up again in the ears of the world.

    "title": "[Column] Buchla Music Easel and the philosophy of \"solitary performance\": Redefining improvisation with analog synths",
    "body": "Introduction: What is Buchla Music Easel?Text: mmr｜Theme: Music Easel, which even in modern times is praised by many live artists as the “smallest orchestra that can be played alone” The Buchla Music Easel, which appeared in 1973, is a portable version of the famous analog modular Buchla 200 series. Designer Don Buchla called the instrument a “portable composition environment. ”It was not just a small modular, but was conceived as a ““personal improvised device. ’’  “Easel is a sonic canvas. You can’t save the lines the player draws at the moment. ”— Don Buchla Chapter 1: Don Buchla and the “Anti-Moog” PhilosophyIn the early 1960s, two major trends in the development of electronic musical instruments arose in East and West America. Moog in the east and Buchla in the west. Buchla aimed to “generate” sound rather than “control” it. A touch plate was used instead of a keyboard, and the focus of performance was on rate of change and contingency rather than pitch. His philosophy was carried over into the later Music Easel. Easel is an instrument for humans to perform with electronic circuits, and what exists there is the attitude of a ““co-author” rather than a ““performer = controller. ” Technical analysis: Relationship between waveform and tactile sensationBuchla thought that “waveform manipulation = tactile experience. ”The figure below is a simplified model of the relationship between FM (frequency modulation) and waveform output in Complex Oscillator. graph TDA[Modulation Oscillator] --&gt;|FM Signal| B[Complex Oscillator]B --&gt;|Wavefolded Output| C[Audio Out]B --&gt; D[Harmonic Timbre CV]D --&gt;|Control Voltage| BDue to this interconnection, a simple sine wave has a harmonic structure, and the minute touches during performance are immediately reflected in the acoustics. Chapter 2: Structure and philosophy of Music EaselMusic Easel consists of two main blocks:  Buchla 208 Stored Program Sound Source Buchla 218 Touch Keyboard ControllerSignal flow diagram (Mermaid)graph LRA[Touch Keyboard 218] --&gt;|CV/Gate| B[Complex Oscillator]B --&gt;|Audio| C[Mixer &amp; Output]A --&gt;|Pressure CV| D[Modulation Oscillator]D --&gt;|FM| BE[Pulser] --&gt;|Trigger| F[Envelope Generator]F --&gt;|CV| BB --&gt; G[Reverb Unit]G --&gt; H[Main Out]This structure allows you to complete clock generation → modulation → sound output** all by itself. Easel itself functions as a “complete music system” without the need for external equipment. Technical features Complex Oscillator: Waveform folding, FM, AM possible.  Pulser: Generates periodic pulses, serves as a clock.  Envelope: Automatically controlled, gated, loopable.  Reverb: Natural reverberation with spring reverb. The idea that integrates these is not “portability” but “improvisation”, and the center of music production has shifted from “thinking” to “tactile sensation”. Chapter 3: Easel as a live instrumentCase 1: Suzanne Ciani “Easel Sessions” (2016–)Legendary female electronic musician Suzanne Ciani started her solo live series “Easel Sessions” at Easel in the 2010s. She does away with any laptops and performs solely on Easel. At the live performance, the pitch changes smoothly with the pressure of the hands, and the FM modulation organically fluctuates. Ciani says, ““Buchla is a breathing instrument. ’’ Sonically, Easel’s asynchronous modulation creates a flow of overtones that seems to float through space. The audience gets the illusion that ““the air itself is being played. ’’ Waveform analysis: Characteristics of improvisational structure      Elements   Technical Points   Auditory Impressions         Change in FM amount of Modulation Oscillator   Waveform fluctuates nonlinearly over time   Organic fluctuation       Pulser + Envelope connection   Generation of cycles without a sense of beat   Sense of time like “breathing”       Self-interference of Reverb reverberation   Opposite phase generation of overtones   Floating feeling/reverberant spread   Chapter 4: Possibility of solo performance and construction of acoustic spaceThe appeal of Easel is that the sound sculpture can be completed without any external effects. By linking multiple modulations using Pulser as a trigger,It is possible to create “generated minimal patterns” and “random rhythm structures. ” Case 2: Charles Cohen “Live at the Rotunda” (2014)Legendary Philadelphia improviser Charles Cohen used the Buchla Music Easel for over 40 years. At his live shows, the concept of tempo collapses, and Pulser expands and contracts like breathing. Cohen said, ““Easel is a tool for sculpting time. ’’ In his performance, the waveform folding of the Complex Oscillator causes overtones to collapse and reproduce continuously,It produces a sound that is as if an acoustic instrument were reconstructing itself. Sound technology analysis: Cohen’s improvisational structuregraph TDA[Pulser] --&gt;|Irregular Trigger| B[Envelope]B --&gt;|CV Modulation| C[Complex Oscillator]C --&gt;|Audio| D[Wavefolder]D --&gt;|Audio| E[Reverb]E --&gt;|Stereo Out| F[Audience Space]This asynchronous trigger structure allows the Easel to generate a “non-metered groove” on its own. Cohen says that music arises just by “surrendering” yourself to the flow of current. Chapter 5: Contemporary Artists and Easel InheritanceSuzanne Ciani→ The embodiment of sonic feminism. I entrust my physicality to Buchla’s soft electric current. Todd Barton→ As an educator, he explains Easel as “the point of contact between consciousness and machines. ”“Don”t play it—listen to it playing you. ” Charles Cohen→ The extreme north of improvisation. A live performance is not about music, but about creating a place. Even after his death, Buchla reprinted his patch as the “Cohen Program Card. ” Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith→ Integrating Easel’s philosophy with digital technology. Extending natural sound fluctuations to modern ambient music. Chapter 6: Technology and physicality - the act of “playing electric current”Playing Music Easel isn’t about flipping a switch;It is the act of relying on the reaction speed of an electric circuit. The pressure, humidity, and temperature of your fingertips affect the CV value and change the sound. In other words, Easel is an instrument in which the human skin becomes the circuit. The sounds that exist there are phenomena, not data. In recent live performances, analog Easel operations are not converted to MIDI,The movement to treat it as a pure current response is once again attracting attention. This “anti-digital” trend is also a sign of bringing back physical reality to electronic music. Conclusion: The future as an orchestraEasel is functionally small and expressively limitless. The electric current flickering inside creates a “living sound” in synchronization with the performer’s breathing. As Charles Cohen said, “Easel is a lonely conversation partner”As Suzanne Ciani has shown, “it is the organ that translates human emotions into electronic form. ” In today’s laptop-dominated live environment,Buchla Music Easel remains a “solitary orchestra”. It holds the future of improvisation hidden within the smallest unit of circuitry.

    "body": "Introduction: Another history of American music told by taiko drumsText: mmr｜Theme: Based on Sabu Martinez and Arsenio RodríguezTracing the turning points of Latin music history longitudinally In the 1950s, a rhythm exchanged at the back door of a jazz club shook the very fabric of American music. It was the moment when Cuban song, African ritual music, and Harlem jazz met. Sabu Martinez”s congas roared like flames, and Arsenio Rodríguez”s tres sounded like it defied theory. In this article, we will discuss the “structure of Afro-Cuban music” that the two men built from their respective sides. Delve into the three layers of culture, society, and music theory. Chapter 1: The birth of Afro-Cuban - From the black earth and the Caribbean SeaAt the end of the 19th century, Cuba was coming to the end of its history as a Spanish colony. However, behind the hustle and bustle of the War of Independence, another revolution was underway - that of music. Yoruba and Congolese ritual rhythms intersect with Spanish melodies, creating songs such as “son,” “rumba,” and “abakua. ”This created a multi-layered rhythmic structure.  **Religious elements: ** Ritual rhythms such as Santería’s ““bata drum” and Congolese ““makuta” have become urban music.  Social factors: After the abolition of slavery, an Afro-American community was formed in Havana, and the professionalization of black musicians progressed.  Technical elements: The standardization of the tres (three-string guitar) and congas made the later montuno structure possible. It is against this background that a blind revolutionary named Arsenio Rodríguez (1911–1970) emerges. Chapter 2: Arsenio Rodríguez - The Structuralist Who Reconstructed Son“El Ciego Maravilloso (The Miraculous Blind Player)”Born in Havana, Arsenio lost his eyesight in an accident as a child. In exchange for this sensation, he gained the supernatural ability to hear the “inner structure of rhythm. ” His innovations:      Extended son with combination of trumpet and tresses.          Montuno (repetitive part) is brought to the fore as the basis of rhythm.          Convert call and response to jazz interplay.          Clarification of the “tumbao” concept by strengthening the baseline.    This led to his band becoming a pioneer as an “Afro-Cuban ensemble. ”It also influenced later Tito Puente, Machito, and Thelonious Monk.  “If jazz seeks reason, Son awakens memory. ”— Arsenio Rodriguez Chapter 3: Sabu Martinez - Beat Poet with Fire“The heartbeat struck by the Saint of Harlem”Sabu Martinez (real name Louis Martinez) was born in the Bronx, New York in 1929. He rose to prominence in Tito Puente’s orchestra. His style combined the intensity of his black roots with the intelligence of jazz improvisation. Representative works: Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1957) Sabu”s Jazz Espagnole (1960) Afro Temple (1973)Features: **A fusion of triplets and polyrhythms. ** Translated Bata drum phrase to conga.  Pioneering use of recording technology (creating sound images at microphone distance). His sound is connected to later Afro-spiritual jazz (Pharoah Sanders, Alice Coltrane).  “Drums are screams. I just turn those screams into songs. ”— Sabu Martinez Chapter 4: Crossroads - Between the Bronx and HavanaWhen Arsenio moved to the United States in 1950 and started working in Harlem,Sabu had been doing sessions in the same city. Although their point of contact is not a direct collaboration,They were deeply intersected within the Bronx-Harlem Afro-diaspora culture.       Era   Arsenio Rodríguez   Sabu Martinez         1940s   Completes Son expansion in Cuba   Joins Tito Puente Orchestra       1950s   Rebuilding Afro-Cuban in Harlem   Leader debut with Palo Congo       1960s   Late recording in New York   Expanding the fusion of jazz and Afro       1970s   Posthumously reevaluated   Emigrated to Europe, deepened spirituality at Afro Temple   During this period, New York’s Latin jazz“Afro Cuban” → “Afro Jazz” → “Spiritual Afro”Sabu and Arsenio were on opposite ends of the spectrum. Chapter 5: Music Theoretical Connections - The Intersection of Clave and PolyrhythmThe clave (2–3 or 3–2 pattern) is the DNA of Afro-Cuban music. Arsenio embedded it in the melodic structure, and Sabu made it the axis of the improvisational structure. flowchart TDA[ Clave (2–3 / 3–2) ] --&gt; B[ Montuno structure of Arsenio ]A --&gt; C[ Sabu's Polyrhythmic Improvisation ]B --&gt; D[ Rhythmization within harmony ]C --&gt; E[ Harmonization within percussion instruments ]D --&gt; F[ Latin Jazz (Machito, Dizzy Gillespie) ]E --&gt; FIt is noteworthy that this structural idea also influenced later electronic music (e. g. Four Tet, Floating Points). The idea that rhythm “generates melody” is an extension of their heritage. Chapter 6: Anthropological Perspective - Drums as a Diaspora Memory DeviceAfro-Caribbean music is inherited through memory, not records. Both Sabu and Arsenio treated drums and tresses as “speaking bodies. ”Its physicality went beyond music and was also a device for reproducing identity.  Arsenio: Music as Black Cuban Self-Definition.  Sabu: Symbol of the re-Africanization of American black culture.  “Taiko will never forget the mother’s words”— From an Afro-Cuban proverb Chapter 7: Heritage and Regeneration – Connections to the Modern Agemodern musician–For example, Miguel Zenón, Daymé Arocena, Makaya McCraven, etc. Translating the genes of Sabu and Arsenio into modern sound design. In particular, Makaya McCraven’s “organic beat collage”It can be said that this is a continuation of Sabu’s ““hand-editing’’ feeling. In addition, Arsenio’s “tumbao structure” isIt is also the prototype of “rhythmic symmetry” in hip-hop loop construction. Chapter 8: Conclusion - Listening to the “roots” of Afro-CubanSabu Martinez and Arsenio Rodriguez――The two started from different islands and ended up on the same heartbeat. Their sound is not Latin music or jazz. It is “memory of fundamental rhythm”,It also resonates with contemporary electronic music and hip-hop. The drum speaks. Torres responds.

    "title": "[Column] Rei Harakami - Quiet electronic sound born in Kyoto",
    "body": "Prologue: Kyoto that lives in the sound roomText: mmr｜Theme: Rei Harakami’s music and the atmosphere and aesthetics of the city of Kyoto When I listen to Rei Harakami’s music, the first thing I feel is ““tranquility. ’’It”s not just an ambient silence, it”s like a breath floating in the ““ma’’ between sounds. His sound certainly breathes the ““aesthetics of space’’ that the city of Kyoto has. The lingering sound of a temple bell, the dampness of a summer shower, the clear flow of Shirakawa in winter. Even though they were not directly sampled, Rei Harakami’s sound somehow conveys the very atmosphere of Kyoto. Chapter 1: The arrival of Rei Harakami - Turning the “silence of the city” into soundRei Harakami is a Kyoto-born track maker who suddenly appeared in the late 1990s amid the rise of Shibuya-kei and IDM. He presented a ““private room” and ““introspective” electronic sound that was different from the glittering Tokyo atmosphere. His representative early work, ““Red Curb’’ (1999), is a work that harmonizes the roundness of analog synth with minimal rhythm. Electronic music for listening alone on the tatami floor rather than the excitement of a club. Therein lies the ““understated humor” and ““gentle loneliness” typical of Kyoto people. His songs are not flashy, but the more you listen to them, the more your world expands. The experience is similar to sitting in the garden of a temple and listening to the sound of the wind. Chapter 2: Kyoto context - machiya, seasons, light and shadowKyoto is a city where history, nature, and the rhythm of life are intertwined in multiple layers. Rei Harakami grew up within this cultural structure of “superposition. ” The wind blows through the eaves of old townhouses, and the light of lanterns reflects on the river. In his music, these ““layers of landscape’’ are reconstructed as sound.  “Scenery becomes a melody. Rhythm reflects the flow of time. ” As Harakami said, his music was not just techno, but an attempt to express the “time of Kyoto” through sound. Chapter 3: Analysis of the work world“red curb” (1999)It features a warm beat and soft tone. Although it is an electronic sound, it has organic breathing. It’s like laughing quietly to yourself in a corner of the city. “opa q” (2001)Acoustic beauty that is more transparent and has a floating feel. Particles of sound are scattered like light, and the relationship between ““sound = light’’ becomes clear. There is a clearness like the morning mist of Kyoto. “lust” (2005)An album depicting “human emotions” using electronic sounds. Deep within the beat, loneliness and warmth coexist. During this period, Harakami”s collaboration with Ryuichi Sakamoto further strengthened Harakami”s “Japanese sound. ” “unrest” (2011)A work published in his later years. There’s something ephemeral about it, and it gives you the feeling of the serenity of accepting the end. It”s like autumn in Kyoto, and it”s a sadness that makes you laugh while staring at the falling leaves. Chapter 4: Harakami and friends - UA, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Kazumi NikaidoThe collaboration with UA “Milk Tea” and Ryuichi Sakamoto,A new element of “human voice” has been added to Rei Harakami’s music. Ryuichi Sakamoto is said to have described him as “the quietest revolutionary. ”He was a rare person who melted the boundaries between electronic and acoustic sounds and achieved both ““gentleness” and ““structural beauty”. Harakami’s interaction with Kazumi Nikaido also shows her dedication to “everyday music. ”His sound was not esoteric experimental music, but the very rhythm of life. Chapter 5: From local to global - Genealogy of Kyoto electronic soundsRei Harakami’s existence had a great influence on later Japanese local electronica. Following in his footsteps, artists such as aus, agraph, Ametsub, and no. 9 emerged from the Kyoto/Kansai area. The sounds all have in common, depicting the relationship between the city and nature. The “sound of Kyoto’s silence” created by Harakami occupies a unique position in the global context. Chapter 6: Loss and Inheritance - Those who inherit the echoes of HarakamiHis sudden passing in 2011 left the music world with a deep sense of loss. But since then, many artists have inherited his sound. Deep within the works of tofubeats, serp, and other young artists who reconstruct environmental sounds,You can see the shadow of Rei Harakami’s “breathing electronic sound”. His influence on the music scene continues to spread far beyond Kyoto. Final chapter: Assimilation of sound and landscape - Aesthetics of “Kyoto electronica”Rei Harakami’s music embodied the harmony between landscape and humans, nature and technology. There is a quiet sense of happiness that is neither ““convenient” nor ““exciting. ” The sound he left behind is as soft as the sunset in Kyoto, and will never fade. If you listen closely, you can still hear that sound floating somewhere in town.  There is sound in the silence. Kyoto is in the sound.

    "title": "[Column] Habib Koité & Bamada and the musical and cultural background of the Republic of Mali",
    "body": "Habib Koité &amp; Bamada - “Quiet revolution” played by Malian stringsText: mmr｜Theme: Comprehensive musical analysis of Habib Koité &amp; Bamada, historical context, inheritance of African identity, and role in globalization  West African tradition and postcolonial reconstruction: “Redefining Mali music” led by Habib Koité Introduction:At the end of the 20th century, music from the African continent began to permeate the world in new forms. While Nigeria”s Fela Kuti championed “political Afrobeat,” Mali”s Habib Koité started a revolution in a quieter way. ──With a single guitar, he recreated the sound of Mali’s traditional stringed instrument ““Kamalengoni” and created ““Mali music without borders” with the band Bamada. His music doesn’t talk politics. However, within that tranquility lies the ethnic dignity and cultural continuity. Koité was a “translator of African aesthetics” in the age of global music. Chapter 1: The musical universe of MaliThe Republic of Mali is a landlocked country located in West Africa. In the geography where the Sahara Desert and the Niger River intersect, there is a rich cultural heritage dating back to the Mali Empire in the 13th century. The music of this land has been inherited by griots = traditional storytellers/musicians. Their role is not just as performers, but as keepers of national memory. Bambara, Songhai, Tuareg, Peul, Dogon… Each ethnic group has its own musical instrument and melody system, and the rhythms are intertwined in multiple layers. This diversity is the “fundamental polyphony” of Malian music, and Koité has repositioned the “guitar” at its center. Chapter 2: Origin and formative years of Habib KoiteHabib Koité was born in Kayazi, Mali in 1958. Her grandmother was part of Geri’s family, and she grew up surrounded by music and stories from an early age. As a young man, he studied at the National Institute of Arts (INA) in Bamako, where he mastered both classical guitar and folk music theory. After graduating, he began to innovate his guitar playing style. Koité devised a unique playing technique in which he pulled the strings with his nails instead of his fingers, reproducing the delicate tone of the kamarengoni. The sound produced by this guitar rejects European tuning and leans closer to African rhythms. It was like the sound of the desert wind and the flow of the Niger River. Chapter 3: Formation of Bamada - A dialogue between the heartbeat of the city and traditionIn 1988, Koité formed his own band Bamada. Bamada is slang for the capital city of Bamako and means “people of Bamako”. The band name itself symbolizes a bridge between city and folklore. Bamada’s sound combines a Western band format (guitar, bass, drums, percussion) with traditional African instruments such as balafon and camalengoni. Koité asked the members to “bring different ethnic rhythms to the table,” translating the diversity within Mali into an ensemble. Chapter 4: Early works and international breakthroughsHis 1991 debut work ““Muso Ko’’ quietly garnered acclaim both in Mali and abroad. However, the decisive turning point was the 1998 album ““Ma Ya**’’. With this work, Koité accomplishes the “folkification” of African music. Excessive percussion and electronic sounds were eliminated to emphasize the organic relationship between guitar and voice.  “When you listen to Habib, you hear Africa with no clichés. ”— Bonnie Raitt (US singer Koité fan) After receiving critical acclaim at world music festivals in Europe and the United States, performing with Ry Cooder and Bonnie Raitt, and participating in the ““Putumayo Presents Africa’’ series, Koité established an international position as the voice of Africa. Chapter 5: Mali’s guitar languageKoité’s guitar is not just an accompaniment, but a ““narrative’’. His playing style has three characteristics:       Diversity in tuning: Change the tuning according to the scale of each ethnic group (especially Bambara, Peul, etc. )         Coexistence of melody and rhythm: The melodic line plays a percussive role at the same time.          Voice integration: Singing and guitar are integrated instead of “call and response”   He says, ““Mari’s guitar is an extension of words. ’’This is because sound is a medium that conveys not only emotions but also ““social memory. ’’ Chapter 6: Koité as a cultural translatorKoité positions himself not as a ““guardian of tradition,” but as a ““translator. ”His goal is to convert Malian sounds into an “understandable language”. But it’s not just globalization. Rather, it is a search for sounds that can reach the world without being westernized. For example, in his live performances, he uses six different languages ​​(Bambara, Dogon, French, English, Songhai, Peul). It goes back and forth between music and words, and embodies ““multilingual identity’’ itself on stage. Chapter 7: Resistance beyond politics - Peace depicted through musicSince the 1990s, Mali has been exposed to civil war, ethnic conflict, and Islamic extremism. Koité’s music does not directly criticize politics, but symbolically sends out a message of peace. For example, ““Afriki” (2007) is an album that calls for unity on the African continent, and at the same time is an ode to the ““local pride” that is lost amid globalization.  “I make music without borders, but its roots are in Mali. ” This “root and branch” metaphor best describes Habib Koité’s philosophy. Chapter 8: 21st Century Mali Music Map and Koité InfluenceSubsequent generations of the Koité included the Rokia Traoré, Fatoumata Diawara, and Vieux Farka Touré. All of them have inherited the “African acoustic context” that Koité established, while evolving in a more personal and experimental direction. In other words, Habib Koité was the first to bridge Malian music from tradition to individual expression. Chapter 9: Sound Analysis - Structural Poetics in “Ma Ya”Take the song “Wassiye” from “Ma Ya” as an example.  Tempo: Around 80BPM (relaxed 6/8 time signature) Rhythm structure: 3-layer polyrhythm (guitar/cajon/calabash) Harmony: Non-functional harmony centered on the pentatonic scale Voice placement: Dialogic composition using melodic echoes rather than unisonWith this structure, the entire song creates a “time for storytelling. ”This differs from the “time passage” of pop songs, the rhythm returns within a ““circular time’‘. The ““philosophy of time’’ that underlies Mali music is expressed here in sound. Chapter 10: Passing on to the future - the balance between culture and the earthAt a time of climate change and cultural disconnect, Habib Koité’s music suggests the coexistence of the local and the global. His works protect ethnic pride while not refusing to engage in dialogue with others. It is a ““quiet methodology’’ through which music restores social solidarity. Chronology: Habib Koité &amp; Bamada (1958–2025)      Year   Events         1958   Born Mari Kayazi       1982   Graduated from Bamako National Institute of Arts and worked as a guitar teacher       1988   Band “Bamada” formed       1991   Debut work “Muso Ko” released       1998   Established international reputation with masterpiece “Ma Ya”       2001   “Baro” released, European tour       2007   “Afriki” focuses on African solidarity       2014   “Soo” released, symbolically portraying post-civil war Mali       2023   African Cultural Achievement Award       2025   “Acoustic Mali Project” starts, young guitarist support program established   Diagram: Genealogy of Mali music and the position of Koitégraph TDA[ Mali traditional musicGriot culture ] --&gt; B[ Ali Farka Touré(Desert Blues) ]B --&gt; C[ Habib Koité &amp; Bamada(Urban acoustic fusion) ]C --&gt; D[ Rokia Traoré / Fatoumata Diawara(Deepening personal expression) ]D --&gt; E[ Global StageNew horizon of world music ]Conclusion:Habib Koité’s music is ““poetry that is passed down” and ““tradition that is renewed”**. When Mari’s strings resonate, it is not a nostalgic recollection of the past, but an act of humanizing the present again. Quiet music makes the world a little bit kinder──As proof of that, Koité’s guitars continue to resonate across the desert today. "

    "body": "DMX: Howling Soul - Between Violence and PrayerText: mmr｜Theme: Deciphering DMX’s rap style, lyrics, and human nature full of contradictions. A record of a soul that continued to burn between violence and prayer, anger and relief.  “The hardest thing is loving someone who don’t love themselves. ”―DMX In the late 1990s, at a time when hip-hop was becoming a symbol of glamorous success, DMX appeared with a voice that sounded like it was spitting blood. It was a voice that went beyond the “reality of the streets” and cried out human pain and prayers. I. Birth of Roar: The existence of DMXEarl Simmons, also known as DMX (Dark Man X). Born in Yonkers, New York, he grew up amid domestic violence and poverty. His childhood was deeply traumatic, and he spent his life going back and forth between juvenile detention centers and church. At this point, he had already formed a ““personality in which God and the devil coexist’’. His raps consist of a barking dog voice, a heavy, cutting beat, and a prayer-like bridge. It was like preaching in church and fighting in the streets at the same time. II. Street Pastor: Lyric Structure and VocabularyDMX’s lyrics are not just a show of violence, but a story of sin and redemption. 1. Double structureHis signature songs “Slippin”” and “The Convo” depict conversations with God. There is often a structure in which they talk to their inner demons and ask God for forgiveness.  “I”m slipping, I”m falling, I can”t get up. ”― Slippin” (1998) 2. Animal metaphorDMX often refers to himself as “dog”. It is a symbol of violence, and at the same time indicates loyalty, solitude, and wildness. The dog was the only companion he could trust, and the object of his prayers.  “I trust dogs more than humans. ”― DMX interview, 2003 III. Style: Bark and Performativity1. The deadly weapon of voiceDMX’s voice is as vivid as a subwoofer roar. His rapping was more about the instantaneous impact of his vocalizations than his flow.  The bass-driven “Grr!” and “Arf!” dominated the rhythm of the track itself. 2. Tempo and structureHis songs often subvert the normal 16-bar structure. The flow suddenly breaks and comes back again. This is because “emotional rhythm” was given top priority. 3. PerformanceAt live performances, it was not uncommon for audience members to cry during DMX’s prayers. When he yelled, “Lord, give me a sign!,” he sounded more like a preacher than a rapper. IV. Ruff Ryders and Runaway SuccessIn 1998, “It”s Dark and Hell Is Hot” was released. DMX quickly reached number one in the US, and went on to set an unprecedented record of five consecutive albums at number one on Billboard. timelinetitle DMX Major works and historical background1998 :  It's Dark and Hell Is Hot  released / No. 1 in the US with debut work1998 :  Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood  / No. 1 again after just 7 months1999 :  And Then There Was X  / 'Party Up' becomes a club anthem2001 :  The Great Depression  / Introspective tone and religiosity strengthened2003 :  Grand Champ  / The pinnacle of success and mental collapseThe ““motorcycle culture x street mythology’’ he created with the Ruff Ryders crew (Swizz Beatz, Eve, The LOX, etc. ) completely redefined the East Coast scene at the time. However, behind the scenes, DMX’s heart was falling apart between his faith and drug addiction. V. Forms of Prayer: Faith and Self-DialogueAlmost every DMX album includes a ““Prayer’’ track. This is his self-purification ritual, indicating that the music is “an extension of prayer. ”  “I come to you hungry and tired, you give me food and let me sleep. ”― Prayer III, 1999 For him, God was not a ““symbol of salvation,” but an ““existence that gives trials. ”His faith is not one of forgiveness but faith in battle. VI. Human DMX: Anecdotes and Essence1. A man sleeping with a dogDMX has rescued homeless dogs and lived with them on the streets. He also brought his dog with him on tour, saying, ““Dogs have pure souls. ’’ 2. Free SermonAfter tours, he often left the audience on stage to pray in tears. That time wasn’t entertainment, it was ceremony. 3. Chain of law and drugsHas been arrested dozens of times. However, most of this is the result of drug addiction and emotional trauma, and he himself says, ““My body broke before my mind died. ’’ VII. Lyric Analysis: Light in the Violence      Song title   Theme   Characteristic lyrics   Interpretation         Ruff Ryders” Anthem   Conflict and unity   “Stop, drop, shut “em down open up shop!”   Coexistence of aggression and street discipline       Slippin”   Introspection and rebirth   “See, to live is to suffer, but to survive is to find meaning in the suffering. ”   Musicalization of Nietzsche”s philosophy of suffering       Lord Give Me a Sign   Faith/Salvation   “I really need to talk to you Lord. ”   A desperate call to God       Who We Be   Social awareness   “The pain, the struggle, the friends, the trouble. ”   The height of rhythmic catalog poetry   VIII. DMX and the Era: Impact since the 2000sDMX’s arrival brought a different kind of ““emotional realism’’ than Jay-Z or Nas. Later, Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar adopted structures that talked about “faith and suffering” as an extension of DMX.  The reflective structure of Kendrick Lamar’s ““DAMN. ’’ Kanye West’s “Jesus Walks” religious hook Pop Smoke’s roaring vocalsBoth inherit the “intersection of anger and prayer” that DMX opened. IX. The Last Prayer - Death and AftermathIn April 2021, DMX passed away due to a drug overdose. Passed away at age 50. His death was perceived by many fans as the end of the “Unsaved Prophet. ” However, his prayers remained even after death. At the final stage, he tearfully said:  “When you fall, get back up. I”m proof that God ain”t done with you yet. ” Those words still serve as a self-forgiveness mantra for many young people today. X. Conclusion: Mythical structure called DMXDMX’s story is more than just a hip-hop biography. It was a modern religious drama and a myth about the coexistence of violence and prayer. *His “roar” is not anger, but a cry to prove his existence***His “prayer” is not salvation but continuation of the battle  His “dog” is a symbol of loyalty and solitudeDMX’s voice no longer exists in this world. But his spirit still screams “Arf! Arf!” in the pre-dawn speakers.

    "title": "[Column] Nala Sinephro - Sound Breathing and Cosmic Silence: The Current State of Ambient Jazz",
    "body": "Prologue: Sound as breathing, improvisation as spaceText: mmr｜Theme: Jazz is not about technique or genre expansion, but about the fundamental question of what sound can bring to humans. When we first hear Nala Sinephro’s music, we are forced to let go of the concept of a “song. ”His debut album Space 1. 8, released by Warp Records in 2021, was a work that melted the boundaries between jazz and ambient, modular synthesis and improvisation as if it were breathing. Harp, tenor saxophone, modular synthesizer, and space itself. Nala’s music depicts the moment when the sound itself becomes a “spiritual environment. ”It is an experience that feels like ““the universe breathing in silence,’’ and turns the listener’s body into a resonating body. Chapter 1: The birth of the London scene - Wind from the SouthWhen people talk about the resurgence of jazz in London, what always comes to mind is the geographical energy of South London. Sons of Kemet, Nubya Garcia, Shabaka Hutchings, Moses Boyd, and others have established a new jazz vocabulary, but Nala Sinephro is the one who has rebuilt the sound from the ““silent side’’. She has St. Lucian and Belgian roots and studied classical and electronic acoustics simultaneously. Through a session at London’s jazz club “Total Refreshment Centre”,He has formed a unique sonic language that freely moves between harp and modular synth.  “Sound is like particles in the air to me. ”― Nala Sinephro As she says, the sound is made up of layers of “particles” and refracts time like light. Chapter 2: Structure of “Space 1. 8” and transformation of consciousnessThe track structure of Space 1. 8 is reminiscent of a yoga or meditation session. From Space 1 to Space 8 – all songs are arranged like “breathing phases”.  Space 1: “Entrance” where subtle modular sounds open up the space Space 2: Harp and saxophone dialogue, inner vibration Space 5: A momentary jazz ensemble appears and disappears like a faint light.  Space 8: 8 minutes of deep breathing, all sounds sinking into space reverberationsThis is more of an ““acoustic spiritual ritual’’ than an album. Just as Miles Davis searched for the “space between sounds” in “In a Silent Way,”Nala is looking for “Sound Breathing”. Chapter 3: The idea of ​​ambient jazzAmbient jazz - it’s more of a sonic attitude than a genre. This is a flow that connects the concept of “environmental music” proposed by Brian Eno to the context of spiritual jazz. Nala Sinephro’s music is in the spirit of Harold Budd, Alice Coltrane, and Laraaji. It is ““contemplative modernism’’ that has been redefined in the post-club era of the 21st century. Her harp and synths diffuse “jazz-like improvisation” into the space by adding layers of sound. The rhythm disappears, the melody drifts, and all that remains is the feel of time and space. flowchart LRA[ Brian EnoAmbient (1978) ] --&gt; B[ Harold BuddSoft Focus ]B --&gt; C[ Alice ColtraneSpiritual Jazz ]C --&gt; D[ Nala SinephroSpace 1. 8 (2021) ]D --&gt; E[ Modern Ambient JazzFloating Points / Sam Shepherd ]As this diagram shows, ambient jazz is a movement that simultaneously carries out the ““inheritance of silence” and the ““renewal of spirituality. ” Chapter 4: Modular synths and the “listening body”In live performances, Nala operates the Eurorack modular system at the same time as the harp. Here, patching itself is an improvisational performance that transforms the listener’s body and space.  Equipment configuration example:    Make Noise Maths  Mutable Instruments Clouds  Intellijel Quad VCA  Moog Mother-32  Ableton Live (for loop processing) This configuration is truly a “breathing device for humans and machines. ”Waveforms wrap around the harp’s echoes, analog temperature neutralizing electronic clarity. It is also an act of sublimating music into a technology prayer. Chapter 5: Politics of Silence - Ambient as Sound CareAfter the pandemic, when the world was surrounded by noise and anxiety,Music like Nala appeared not as “healing” but as a form of resistance. “Silence” is not just a rest. It is also the politics of self-care, in which one regains one’s own rhythm against the hustle and bustle of the world. Listening to her music is an act of returning to one’s inner self. At the same time, it is also a declaration of slowness in response to the speed of society.

At the heart of ambient jazz is the hope that ““listening to music” can once again become ““an act of connecting with the world. ”Each note released by Nala’s harp is as quiet as the breathing of the universe, but it is certainly alive.

    "title": "[Column] Madvillain \"Madvillainy\" ─ 21st century hip-hop myth woven from fragments and masks",
    "body": "Prologue: Music behind the maskText: mmr｜Theme: A study of “Madvillainy” (https://amzn. to/3JhySfH), a “labyrinth of sound” that reconstructs the hip-hop form itself after deconstructing it. In the spring of 2004, an album released by a small label in Los Angeles, Stones Throw Records, quietly overturned the conventional wisdom of hip-hop. Madvillain  ”Madvillainy”’ —It”s a rap album, a poetry collection, and a sound collage through radio waves. ** At the beginning of the 21st century, American hip-hop was moving toward the extravagant “brand culture” symbolized by Jay-Z and 50 Cent. On the flip side, this album is about anonymity and the poetics of fragments, and it has deep roots in the world’s underground. What captivates the listener is not the degree of perfection, but rather the ““unfinished beauty’’. Chapter 1: Two extraordinary talents──Madlib and MF DOOMMadlib: Alchemist of SoundMadlib (real name Otis Jackson Jr. ) is a “sampler poet” who alchemizes musical chaos. His beats are not based on a systematic rhythm, but instead are dominated by an ““aesthetics of chance’’. Old records, library sound archives, anime sound effects - all of these can be used as materials. Especially in this work, SP-303 Dr. Sample holds the key. Although it is cheaper and more lo-fi equipment than a typical MPC, Madlib actively retains its rough texture**. By shifting the pitch of the sampling and making the loop subtly waver, they achieved an “unstableness that cannot be reproduced in a live performance. ” MF DOOM: The Masked PoetMF DOOM (real name Daniel Dumile) was born out of tragedy. In the early 1990s, when he debuted as KMD, he lost his younger brother Subroc in an accident, and his contract with the label came to an end. He remained silent for several years and returned wearing a metal mask. ** DOOM made the mask a symbol of “creation” rather than “escape. ”His lyrics are full of complex meter, internal rhyme, and metaphor, and are a mix of literary structure and street style. For example, in “Figaro,” the chain of vowels and the rhythm of consonants sound like an instrument. He was a rapper who manipulated words not as “meanings” but as “sounds. ” Chapter 2: Production background: Myths born from home recordingsMadvillainy was not made in a Hollywood studio, but in an apartment in the Los Angeles suburbs. Madlib samples the jazz and soundtracks he recorded while in Brazil and sends them to DOOM as a kind of cassette journal. DOOM listened to it at home and rapped it almost improvised. The speed of this “back and forth production” determined the density of the work. Both beats and rap maintain a rawness that resists modification, prioritizing “feel” over perfection. Peanut Butter Wolf, head of Stones Throw at the time, said, ““Recording was more like a ritual than an experiment. ’’ Chapter 3: Acoustic analysis ── Poetics of fragment structureThe 22 songs on “Madvillainy” (https://amzn. to/3JhySfH) are structured like one long “montage film. ”The acoustic characteristics can be summarized into the following three points.  Time Disconnect: The song is short and ends abruptly. The transitions are intentionally rough.  Spatial Compression: Minimize reverb and spatial processing to bring the distance between samples close to zero.  Frequency distortion: Creates a VHS-like sound where the high frequencies are removed by making extensive use of SP-303 effects. This is also a “record reconstruction” by Madlib. Viewing the noise and crackling sounds of old recordings as ““components” rather than ““materials,” he transformed hip-hop into an archeology of sound. Chapter 4: Analysis by track (selection)AccordionThe first thing you hear is an ominous loop of an accordion riff. The beat seems monotonous and slightly off. DOOM’s voice comes in to complement the “distortion”, showing that beat and rap have a complementary relationship. ““Rather than controlling the rhythm, it floats’’ - this attitude runs through the entire album. Meat GrinderThe bass line creaks like metal, and the sound of breathing as it approaches the microphone is recorded. Madlib’s sampling deliberately removes pitch correction makes the listener aware of the ““boundary between discomfort and pleasure. ’’ FigaroDOOM’s cadence in this song can be analyzed as a poetic structure. For example, the following passage:  “The rest is empty with no brain but the clever nerd” The internal rhymes of “empty,” “brain,” and “clever” are chained together, transcending context and creating meaning in and of themselves. His rapping functions as a sound device rather than poetry. All Caps“ALL CAPS when you spell the man name”──Here DOOM defines its own symbolism. The command, “Write your name in capital letters,” is like a spell to protect the self beneath the mask. This song, including the music video (cartoon style), pioneered the fusion of hip-hop = superhero culture. Chapter 5: Artwork and the Politics of MasksThe jacket photo (taken by Eric Coleman) is a close-up of DOOM’s metal mask. The composition, in which half of the face is submerged in shadow, symbolizes the gap between anonymity and exposure, myth and reality. This mask served both as a means of self-expression as a black artist and as a form of resistance to commercial media. DOOM”s mask is a pop culture reference to Marvel”s Dr. Doom, but more deeply it represents a reversal of power and identity. There is a paradox here that ““villain = person who has the freedom to speak’‘**. Chapter 6: Critical Evaluation: Innovation brought about by “Fragment Album”Madvillainy, which was not a commercial success upon its release in 2004, received a cult following among critics. Pitchfork called it “the pinnacle of non-linear editing in hip-hop,” and The Wire called it “a 21st century version of The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico. ” Importantly, this album functions as ““proto-internet music. ’’Before YouTube or SoundCloud, there was already a methodology for re-editing pieces of information to create new meaning. In other words, ““Madvillainy’’ is the original text of the post-net era. Chapter 7: Cultural Context: Stones Throw and the Spirit of IndependenceStones Throw Records was a symbol of indie hip-hop culture at the time. While major music companies compete for glamor, Peanut Butter Wolf’s philosophy is to record the truth even on a low budget. Madlib, J Dilla, Aloe Blacc and others appeared on the label, building a bridge between home recording and experimentation.  ”Madvillainy” is a symbolic achievement of this, establishing a paradoxical aesthetic that ““uses the limitations of recording technology as a weapon of expression”. Chapter 8: Impact and Legacy Flying Lotus: A fusion of jazz and beat science.  Earl Sweatshirt: Fragmented introspective rap borrowed from DOOM.  Tyler, the Creator: Character building and the inheritance of irony.  lo-fi hiphop culture: Inheriting SP sound and even creating “study BGM” on YouTube. Furthermore, DOOM’s mask culture has influenced the image of artists after the internet. Anonymous accounts, VTubers, AI-generated music, etc. – the value axis has shifted from “who made it” to “how it resonates”**. Chapter 9: Hip-hop after DOOM (supplementary chapter)MF DOOM’s death (October 31, 2020, at the age of 49) was a quiet final chapter in hip-hop history. However, his absence also encouraged the “inheritance of masks. ”Now, DOOM exists not as a person but as a “method”. Connecting fragments, hiding names, and speaking through sounds. Every time you play “Madvillainy”, the listener becomes “someone but no one. ”That is the pleasure of 21st century anonymity.

There is no ““completion” or ““end. ”Sampled sounds regain meaning even as they lose their origins. The mask left behind by DOOM still shines in underground studios around the world.  “It ain”t nuttin” like the villain. ”― MF DOOM "

About the myth, sound, and inheritance from the 1960s to the present day  “We were a flying teapot sailing through the revolution. ”― Daevid Allen table of contents [Chapter 1 France in the late 1960s - Revolutionary period of exaltation and chaos] (#chapter1) [Chapter 2 Birth and Anecdote - Anarchy Commune that Creates a Paradise] (#chapter2) [Chapter 3 Musical DNA - Glissando guitar and chant “Space Whisper”] (#chapter3) [Chapter 4 Radio Gnomes Trilogy - Myths and Albums] (#chapter4) [Chapter 5 Gong as a community - life, creation, fluid members] (#chapter5) Chapter 6 Society and Gong—the point of contact with counterculture Chapter 7 Transformation and Inheritance——Moellan Gong and Rebirth [Chapter 8 The world of Gong mythology—Characters, iconography, and worldview] (#chapter8) Chapter 9 Episodes &amp; Anecdotes Chapter 10 Chronology and reference figuresChapter 1 Late 1960s France - Revolutionary period of exaltation and chaosAt the end of the 1960s, Paris was a testing ground for revolution. University conflicts, street action, and the liberation of art - the enthusiasm of the “May Revolution” engulfs young people, and music, poetry, and politics become one. Gong was born right in the middle of this. Anti-establishment, anarchy, spiritual world, commune culture. By mixing these together, Gong embodies a “community fantasy through sound. ”  🎵 Recommended sources: Magick Brother (1969), Camembert Electrique (1971) Gong’s sound was a chemical reaction between social chaos and spiritual utopian ideas. Chapter 2 Birth and anecdote - Anarchy commune creating a paradiseIn 1967, David Allen (formerly of Soft Machine) was refused re-entry to the UK and fled to France. In Paris, he met Gilli Smith, and through a series of improvisational sessions, ““Gong’’ was formed. Many legends surround the birth of Gong, including sessions in caves and protest performances using teddy bears. Their base of activity was not just a band, but an “anarchy commune” of sound and ideology.       Year   Anecdote/Incident         1967   At the height of the Paris May Revolution, Allen travels to France and exiles       1968   “Teddy Bear Incident” - Stuffed animal thrown at police       1969   Magick Brother production and first live performance   Characters: Zero the Hero (traveler), Octave Doctor (sound scientist)  “Gong was a free ship to sail on. ” - Member testimony This “voyage” was not just a musical activity, but a live experiment. Chapter 3 Musical DNA - Glissando guitar and chant “Space Whisper”Gong’s sonic core is formed by two elements.  Glissando Guitar by David Allen:As the strings slide, the sound changes like a fluid.  Space Whisper by Gilly Smith:He murmurs in a low voice as if drifting through the space, enveloping the soundscape. In addition, Didier Margrive”s saxophone and Pierre Moherlin”s percussion are added, creating a harmonious mix of jazz, rock, and poetic recitation.  🎧 Recommended listening: Flying Teapot, Angel”s Egg, You Gong’s music created a world in the form of ““sound poetry” rather than ““rock + jazz. ” Chapter 4 Radio Gnomes Trilogy - Myths and AlbumsA trilogy released between 1973 and 1974. “Flying Teapot,” “Angel”s Egg,” and “You. ” These are not just albums, but mythological epics of “Planet Gong”. Taking the form of a radio broadcast, Zero the Hero and Pot Head Pixies appear, and the journey through space and consciousness is depicted.       Character   Characteristics         Zero the Hero   A traveler who travels between Earth and the Gong planet       Pot Head Pixies   Spirits of Happiness and Chaos       Octave Doctor   Scientist who manipulates sound and order    “I am your radio gnome, direct from the planet Gong…” Gong established the concept of ““narrative sound’’ in music. Chapter 5 Gong as a community - life, creation, fluid membersA communal lifestyle based in a lodge in the south of France. There, recording, improvisation, philosophical dialogue, vegetarianism, raising children, and writing poetry were all continuous. Members came and went rapidly, and the sound structure was as fluid as its structure. Despite this, Gong’s “spirit” remained. This is because they were not “fixed members” but existed as a shared vision. Gong was the ideal form of ““a life of music” and ““playing as if you were living it. ” Chapter 6 Society and Gong——Intersection with countercultureGong was about more than music. Europe’s hippie movement, dropout culture, commune ideology, anti-nuclear demonstrations, and environmental movements. Closely linked to these, their sounds resonated as the music of “another society. ”  “Music was not a weapon, but a device to expand mental freedom. ” Gong was a symbol of countercultural practice that did not separate society and art. Chapter 7 Transformation and inheritance——Moellan-Gong and rebirthAfter 1976, David Allen left. Pierre Moerlan took over, and the jazz fusion-oriented Pierre Moerlan’s Gong was born. This innovation, which brought percussion and marimba to the fore, formed an important trend in European progressive rock in the late 1970s. After that, derivatives such as “Gong Maison” and “Acid Mothers Gong” were born. Even after Allen passed away in 2015, Gong continues to live on as a “regenerating collective consciousness. ”  🎼 Representative works: Expresso II, Downwind, Rejoice! I”m Dead! Chapter 8 The world of Gong mythology—Characters, iconography, and worldviewGong is a comprehensive art that integrates music, mythology, and art. Centering around the Radio Gnome trilogy, characters, planets, languages, broadcast stations, etc. are intricately intertwined.

Explore the scientific structure hidden in his music and its redefinition as ambient jazz   Sam Shepherd, aka Floating Points, was a neuroscientist before he was a musician. The ““precise sound design” and ““organic improvisation” that characterize his work are the very thoughts he creates as he goes back and forth between the laboratory and the stage. Electronic sounds are not inorganic data, but can be seen as waveforms that fluctuate in the same way as brain reactions. For him, sound is both a “measurable natural phenomenon” and the “uncontrollable breath of life. ” 2. Science of structure - Elaenia period (2015)His debut album ““Elaenia’’ is a turning point in the scientific reorganization of the context of ambient jazz. The sound consists of modular synthesizer waveforms, Rhodes overtones, and string reverberations layered together to create a frequency dialogue. This dialogue is more like ““resonance as a physical phenomenon’’ like wave interference than improvisation.  “Silhouettes (I, II &amp; III)” is a 10 minute sonic experiment,Synth LFO (low frequency vibration) and drummer Leo Taylor’s rhythmRepeat synchronization and desynchronization as frequencies of different periods. There is a moment here where “human rhythm” and “machine cycle” intersect. It”s not just a fusion, it”s a point of observable chaos. 3. Compression and implosion - Crush period (2019)In “Crush,” synthesized sound pressure and jazz rhythms are compressed to the limit. The result is an improvised form of electronic energy. In the title song “Falaise”, the algorithmic filter modulation changes in milliseconds,Sound flows almost like a ““physical phenomenon of liquid. ’’ In Shepherd’s studio, Ableton and Eurorack serve as models of neural networks in the brain. Each knob tweak is an acoustic experiment that changes the rate at which neurons fire. At this point, jazz improvisation no longer becomes a ““person’s performance” but a ““response to a signal. ”It is “improvisation performed by a machine” and is also a pioneering form of post-human jazz. 4. Resonance of light - Promises period (2021)Promises, co-written with Pharoah Sanders, is a work in which Floating Points’ scientific sonic thinking reaches the realm of the soul. This album intersects the physical “measurement of sound” and the metaphysical “sense of time. ”The motif that runs through the nine-chapter suite is the repetition of just a few notes, which change like quantum interference patterns. Pharoah Sanders’ saxophone blends into electronic sounds while maintaining its human “breathing” quality. The balance is like the relationship between the observer and the observed object. Floating Points’ sounds measure space, and Sanders’ breath sways it. There, science and spirituality, measurement and prayer coexist as one acoustic phenomenon. 5. Analysis diagram: Acoustic triaxial modelBelow is an abstract model that represents the acoustic structure of Floating Points in terms of the “frequency axis,” “sound pressure axis,” and “improvisation trajectory axis. ” graph TDA[ Frequency Spectrum ] --&gt; B[ Space formation by harmonic interference ]B --&gt; C[ Dynamic Pressure ]C --&gt; D[ Improvisation Path ]D --&gt; E[ Scientific expansion of ambient jazz ]While jazz improvisation was a temporal phenomenon, this modelThe acoustics of Floating Points show that improvisation unfolds in space and frequency. The listener becomes a listener who observes space rather than following time. 6. Critical Supplement: Redefining Ambient JazzWhat Floating Points presented was not ambient “tranquility” butSilence as a dynamic observation. “Ambient” here is not environmental music, but “Field of Observation”. While Brian Eno explored sounds that “expanded” space,Shepherd designs “sounds to analyze. ”This difference signifies a shift in which the listener becomes a researcher rather than a meditator. Ambient jazz has transformed from a music of emotion to a music of thought. 7. Chronology: Floating Points Acoustic research trajectorytimelinetitle Floating Points Chronology (2009–2025)2009: Debut EP  Vacuum Boogie  released. Attention in the London club scene. 2011: Co-founded Eglo Records. Soul-electronica fusion period. 2015:  Elaenia  announced. Acoustic design of modular structure is praised. 2017: Organized live as Floating Points Ensemble. Expanded jazz character. 2019:  Crush  released. Dense improvisation by Eurorack. 2021:  Promises  (with Pharoah Sanders &amp; LSO) combines spirituality and science. 2023: Collaboration exhibition  Light Patterns  with contemporary acoustics will be held. 2025: It is reported that the new work  Spectral Biology (tentative title)  is under production. 8. Conclusion: Observing soundListening to Floating Points’ music is more like an act of ““observing” the sound rather than ““experiencing” it. Here, hearing functions as a scientific sense organ, and music rises to the middle ground** between the mind and the physical. The genre of ambient jazz was created by him from ““experimental music in silence. ’’It evolved into ““music as observation. ’’It is an attempt to explain the unexplainable using the language of science,That contradiction is at the heart of Floating Points’ aesthetic.

    "title": "[Column] Three Suns and the magic of the accordion - an acoustic fable born in postwar America",
    "body": "Prologue: Three suns echoing in the living room at duskText: mmr｜Theme: Exploring the soundscape of postwar America drawn by a trio of accordion, guitar, and organ A soft melody plays from the radio. What was ringing there was Three Suns――It was a symbol of American home music in the 1940s, consisting of an accordion, guitar, and electric organ. This was a time when the war was over and television was not yet widespread. The music that played in people’s living rooms was neither jazz nor classical music, but the sound that symbolized ““relaxation’’ itself. At the center of that sound was the accordion. Three Suns’ music quietly influenced generations to come, pioneering lounge, exotica, and space-age pop. Chapter 1: The Three Suns Phenomenon - Music for the HomeThree Suns was formed in 1940 by Pennsylvania brothers Al Nevins (guitar), Morty Nevins (accordion), and their cousin Artie Dunn (organ). At first, they mainly performed in nightclubs and hotel lounges, but in 1944, ““Twilight Time’’ became a hit. It can be said that this one song gave birth to the concept of “home music” in postwar America.  🎵 “Heavenly shades of night are falling…”As symbolized by this phrase, their music created an atmosphere of ““night. ’’ The sound of the accordion is connected to the nostalgia of soldiers returning from the battlefield. The guitar and organ gently envelop it. That sound was a “light of sound” that warmed the microcosm of the home. Chapter 2: The Role of the Accordion – A Pretty, Experimental HeartMorty Nevins” accordion wasn”t just an accompaniment, it was a designer of melody and space. The lead moves like a slide, the bellows moves like a breath, and the tempo fluctuates slightly. These create Three Suns’ unique feeling of floating and happiness. In the 1950s, they signed a contract with RCA and released a series of experimental works that incorporated magnetic recording and stereo technology. “Movin” “n’ Groovin’” (1956), “Midnight for Two” (1957), etc. It had sonic sophistication that it could be called  ”living room electronic music’‘.  Accordion = not nostalgia,It functioned as a “breathing synthesizer” responsible for the future of sound design. Chapter 3: Lounge Culture and Three Suns - Interiorization of SoundIn the late 1950s, American society entered an era of affluence and a desire for “relaxation. ”Modern furniture, cocktails and hi-fi stereo. And music like Three Suns was playing in the background. Their music was optimized for the interior spaces of homes, not clubs or theaters. It was truly interior design of sound.

However, in the 21st century, their recordings have regained attention with the reappraisal of Exotica and Lounge. In particular, the sound of the accordion has come to be redefined as an ““organic electronic sound’’ that predates analog synthesizers.  The accordion is a symbol of nostalgia,Reincarnated into “lo-fi, psychedelic future sound”. Chapter 5: Modern Reinterpretations - From Three Suns to Lo-fi ChillListening to Three Suns on YouTube or Spotify, their warm sound seems like the origin of modern-day Lo-fi Chill Hop and Bedroom Pop. The ““ma’’, where the density of sound is thin and exists like air, was the forerunner of digital music.

    "title": "[Column] The origins of sampling - 20 most sampled sound sources",
    "body": "Prologue: Tracing the DNA of soundText: mmr｜Theme: Based on data such as WhoSampled, we will highlight the ““20 most sampled sound sources’’ and explore how each has been etched into music history. Sampling is a technology that most directly embodies ““quotation” and ““reconstruction” in the history of music. From the early days of hip-hop in the late ’70s to today’s electronica, a single drum break, bassline, or scream has been transformed into hundreds or thousands of songs. 1. The Winstons – “Amen, Brother” (1969)Commonly known as “Amen Break”. The six-second drum solo spawned countless genres, including hip-hop, jungle, drum and bass, and hardcore techno. Producers everywhere from N. W. A. and Public Enemy to Aphex Twin and The Prodigy carved out this break. Former drummer Gregory Coleman passed away without a reward, but the ““spirit of the groove’’ that dwells between the snare and the hi-hat continues to resonate. 2. Lyn Collins – “Think (About It)” (1972)Produced by James Brown. A woman”s powerful shout and “Woo! Yeah!” break symbolize the golden age of hip-hop. Quotes include Rob Base &amp; DJ E-Z Rock”s “It Takes Two,” as well as Snoop Dogg and Beyoncé. Combining the strength of feminism and the dynamism of funk, it caused a “chain reaction of voices” on the club floor. 3. The Clash – “Straight to Hell” (1982)The melancholy guitar and percussion resurface in M. I. A. ’s “Paper Planes. ” Lyrics about immigration, labor, and loneliness echo 21st century political hip-hop. The sampling of this song is not just a sound material, but has been passed down as a “gene of rebellion. ” 4. Chic – “Good Times” (1979)Bernard Edwards” bass line became famous on Sugarhill Gang”s “Rapper’s Delight. ” As the “bridge” that connected disco and hip-hop, its importance in music history is immeasurable. “Recursive funk” that is similar to later Daft Punk and self-sampling by Nile Rodgers himself. 5. James Brown – “Funky Drummer” (1970)Clyde Stubblefield’s drum break is the holy grail of sampling. Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Prince, Beastie Boys – every time that snare hit, the era was renewed. The ““nucleus of rhythm’’ has breathed life into the greatest number of works, from before hip-hop to after hip-hop. 6. Curtis Mayfield – “Move On Up” (1970)A symbol of elation rediscovered by a younger generation with Kanye West’s “Touch the Sky. ” Combining the spirit of hope and resistance, he transferred the spirit of soul to hip-hop. Curtis’ falsetto is an eternal message of “evolving black music. ” 7. Bob James – “Take Me to the Mardi Gras” (1975)The cowbell and bell sound of the drums was distinctive, and it was loved by Run-D. M. C. , Beastie Boys, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, and others. Bob James is a symbol of smooth jazz, and the “hard break” that this song produced was deified in the sampling culture of the 1990s. 8. Incredible Bongo Band – “Apache” (1973)A legendary break that Kool Herc used in two copies at a block party in the Bronx. This is why it is called the origin of hip-hop. It continues to live on as a “sacred scripture” for dancers and turntablists. 9. Melvin Bliss – “Synthetic Substitution” (1973)Another famous break that formed the backbone of hip-hop. Frequently used by Naughty by Nature, J Dilla, De La Soul, and others. Although the melody is modest, the “space” between the snare and kick forms a golden ratio. 10. The Honey Drippers – “Impeach the President” (1973)A drum break where political messages and grooves coexist. Quoted by Nas, The Notorious B. I. G. , and even J. Cole. The reason why the title ironically resonates across time is because the ““aesthetics of resistance’’ engraved in the rhythm is universal. 11. The Charmels – “As Long As I”ve Got You” (1967)The original melody used in Wu-Tang Clan’s “C. R. E. A. M. ” Sweet strings and melancholic vocals supported the poetry of the street. A famous material that symbolizes RZA’s “shade sampling philosophy”. 12. Joe Tex – “Papa Was Too” (1966)A fusion of James Brown-style funk and comedic rhythms. Quoted by Fatboy Slim and the Beastie Boys, it became the key to translating the “talk” of funk into hip-hop. 13. The Isley Brothers – “Between the Sheets” (1983)Famous for songs such as Notorious B. I. G. ’s ““Big Poppa” and Jay-Z”s ““Ignorant Shit. ” Sexy and melancholy mellowness is the origin of 90”s R&amp;B. The smooth groove has a level of perfection that feels like it was written with the premise of being sampled. 14. Mountain – “Long Red” (1972)The chant “You know what I mean!” was often used by Public Enemy and De La Soul during live performances. This is a great example of how a simple rock song becomes a hip-hop “part” through vocal sampling. 15. The Emotions – “Blind Alley” (1972)Known for Big Daddy Kane”s ““Ain”t No Half-Steppin’’ and Mary J. Blige. Reconstructing the warmth of sweet soul with the hardness of the beat - this contrast was the essence of the Golden Age. 16. Edwin Birdsong – “Cola Bottle Baby” (1979)Reconstructed into Daft Punk’s ““Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,’’ it became the cornerstone of 21st century electro-pop. The moment when the experimental funk of the 70s was reborn in the age of technology. 17. Dennis Coffey – “Scorpio” (1971)A masterpiece of instrumental funk, LL Cool J and Public Enemy cited it as a breakout song. The distortion of the electric guitar symbolizes the roughness of the city. 18. Barry White – “I”m Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby” (1973)In the sampling world, it is a symbol of love. Quoted by The Dream and Kanye West, it straddles the line between soul and desire. The ““sustained sound’’ of sweet strings gave hip-hop a luxurious feel. 19. Tom Scott – “Today” (1973)Used on Pete Rock &amp; C. L. Smooth’s “They Reminisce Over You”. This song, which has themes of sadness and memory, showed that sampling can be an art of “memorial. ” 20. The Soul Searchers – “Ashley”s Roachclip” (1974)Used by The Roots, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Arrested Development, and more. The transparency and density of the drum break was inherited by the ““warm sampling aesthetic’’ of the 1990s. Chronology: Evolutionary history of sampling      Years   Events         1960s   Soul/funk recording technology develops. The budding drum break culture.        1973   Kool Herc plays two copies of “Apache” at a block party. Birth of hip hop.        1984   Run-D. M. C. achieves first commercial sampling hit.        1989   Public Enemy’s ““Fear of a Black Planet’’ establishes multiple sampling techniques.        1994   Wu-Tang Clan, RZA’s “noise sampling” creates a new trend.        2000s   Daft Punk and Kanye West turn soul samples into pop.        2020s   Towards a new era of AI sampling and copyright issues.

Behind this is the breathing of nameless musicians, the noise of equipment, and the inheritance of culture. ““The same sound coming back again and again’’ is proof of the evolution of pop music, and is the most humane technology that connects the past and the future.

    "title": "[Column] Teo Macero and Miles Davis —— The moment when editing surpasses creativity",
    "body": "Prologue: “Another instrument” called the recording room      Text: mmr   Theme: ““Musical Revolution through Editing’’ built by Miles Davis and Teo Macero—Tracing new horizons in recording art through the magic of tape splicing and composition.    At the end of the 1960s, Miles Davis’s music was no longer an extension of his live performances, but instead transformed into a “sound architecture” constructed through recording and editing. Behind the change is producer and editor Teo Macero. Masero was not just a “behind the scenes” person. In his hands, a huge number of session tapes were cut and pasted and reassembled, resulting in a group of works that can be called ““composition by editing’’. ““In a Silent Way” (1969) and ““Bitches Brew” (1970) are prime examples. There is a revolution in editing aesthetics that goes beyond the boundaries between ““performance” and ““composition”. Chapter 1: The birth of an editor named Teo MaceroTeo Macero was born in 1925 in Glens Falls, New York. He began his career as a jazz saxophonist and later studied composition at Columbia University, where he became familiar with avant-garde contemporary music. Like Stockhausen and Varèse, Macero developed an early awareness of treating sound as a material. In the late 1950s, he became a staff producer at Columbia Records, working with artists such as Miles Davis and Dave Brubeck. However, what set him apart from other producers was that he understood editing itself as a place of creation.  “Even after the performance ends, the music doesn’t end. It starts all over again in the editing room. ”— Teo Macero Chapter 2: “In a Silent Way”—— The magic of time editing ”In a Silent Way,” recorded in 1969, can be said to be the ““starting point of editing” in the history of jazz. Miles, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter and others improvised the sessions, but Theo Macero boldly restructured the recordings. What is particularly impressive is the ““ring structure’’ in which the same take is used at the beginning and end. Phrases that were only played once in the actual recording “reappeared” through Macero’s editing, musically embodying the concept of a time loop. This structure anticipates the sensibilities that would later be found in ambient and minimal techno. Macero cut off the ““linear time of music” and created ““circular time through editing. ” flowchart LRA[ Session recording (multiple takes) ] --&gt; B[ Tape editing ]B --&gt; C[ Configuration rearrangement (forward/backward reversal/looping) ]C --&gt; D[ In a Silent Way: Completed form ]D --&gt; E[ → Reconstruction of the sense of time ]Chapter 3: “Bitches Brew”—— The operating table that creates order from chaosWith 1970”s Bitches Brew, Macero”s editing techniques exploded further. More than six tape recorders were running at the same time, making the studio feel like a laboratory. Each performer does not share a common theme, resulting in a flood of fragmented improvisations. Macero spliced ​​these fragments into units of several meters and designed the rhythmic flow and acoustic “place” through editing.  “I chopped up the sounds and reconstructed them. It was the same act as composing. ”— Teo Macero His method was similar to musique concrète, but also connected to the free improvisation of jazz. The editing in ““Bitches Brew” can be described as ““another improvisation” after recording. graph TDT1[ Take A: Miles' Trumpet Fragment ]T2[ Take B: Zawinul's electric piano session ]T3[ Take C: Drum Duo ]T4[ Take D: Guitar Solo ]E[ Teo's editing desk ]F[ Final version of 'Bitches Brew' ]T1 --&gt; ET2 --&gt; ET3 --&gt; ET4 --&gt; EE --&gt; FChapter 4: The idea of ​​editing = compositionTeo Macero’s greatest contribution was to elevate recording technology from an auxiliary tool to a creative medium. It was the forerunner of the paradigm of ““editing = composing. ’’    Structural transformation by physical cutting (tape splice)     Sound field design using spatial synthesis (reverb, pan, layer)     Creating new contexts by controlling coincidence (rearranging the order of phrases)  This philosophy would later be carried over into hip-hop sampling and Brian Eno’s studio art. In other words, Macero has carved out a new profession: ““post-recording composer. ’’ Chapter 5: Tension with MilesThe relationship between Miles Davis and Macero has always been one of collaboration and conflict. While Miles pursued the freedom of improvisation, Macero sought to shape the results through editing. The tension between the two is the very lifeblood of the work. In a sense, Miles”s ““revolution’’ would not have been possible without Macero, and Macello”s editing magic could only have been possible because of Miles’ subversive material. The relationship between the two was a dialectic of “construction and demolition. ” Chapter 6: Toward the post-Masero era—inheritance and influenceIn the late 1970s, Macero left Columbia, but his influence continued to spread throughout his subsequent music production. In particular, Masero’s editorial philosophy was clearly inherited in the following areas.       Field   Representative Artist   Inheritance         Ambient/Electronic Music   Brian Eno   Spatial Editing and Repetitive Structures       Hip-hop   DJ Shadow, Madlib   Sample editing = Constructive composition       Techno/Experimental music   Plastikman, Autechre   Time manipulation and fragmented aesthetics       Visual music/sound art   John Oswald   Recontextualization of existing material   In this way, Macero’s ““editing spirit’’ continues to live on even in the digital age. Chapter 7: From tape to DAW—continuity and discontinuity in technologyThe DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) we use today is an environment that non-destructively recreates the tape editing of Macero’s era. However, what is decisively different is the ““feel’’ of editing and time. Editing in the tape era was irreversible, and every cut was always a risk. That tension gave the music “life. ”Masero’s sensibility in the digital age is not just the operation of tools, but the awareness of designing time through editing.

The Mermaid diagram below is a step-by-step recreation of his typical editing workflow. flowchart TDA[ 1️⃣ Session recording:Multi-track recording of several hours of improvised jams ] --&gt; B[ 2️⃣Tape listening/note-taking:Listen to all takes and record useful fragments in time axis memo ]B --&gt; C[ 3️⃣ Markup:Insert markers at  usable  moments (groove/theme) ]C --&gt; D[ 4️⃣ Fragment extraction:Physically cut in 1-2m units and organize into reels ]D --&gt; E[ 5️⃣ Editing blueprint:Designing the fragment order as a composition diagram on paper (temporal composition composition) ]E --&gt; F[ 6️⃣ Splice editing:Joining tape by hand (physical cutting + tape adhesion) ]F --&gt; G[ 7️⃣ Listening verification:Auditory evaluation of the flow/tension of the composition ]G --&gt; H[ 8️⃣ Sound processing:Spatialization with reverb, EQ, panning, etc.  ]H --&gt; I[ 9️⃣ Final construction: Edited version master tape completed → LP ]The most important step in this process is the stage called ““Blueprint = Edited Score’’. Macero designed the structure of the song by handwriting the time code and content on each fragment. It was an act of composing like an architect designing a space. Chapter 9: Philosophical aspects of editing techniques —— The idea of ​​”composing ears”Macello’s editorial philosophy is to view recordings not as “objective records” but as “reconstructed experiences. ”There is a philosophical foundation here that resonates throughout 20th century art.       Ideological elements   Content   Related areas         Constructivism   Meaning is created through the arrangement and rearrangement of materials   Architecture/Contemporary Music       Controlled Chance   Controlling improvised fragments through editing   Cage, Varèse       Sculpting in Time   Designing “aural time” through editing   Film editing (Tarkovsky)       Meta-composition   Reconfiguring materials at a higher level of composition   Sound art, DAW culture   Macero was the first person to embody the concept of ““two-step composition,’’ in which music is composed after recording. For him, improvisation was the ““generation of materials,” and editing was the ““place of construction. ”  “Performing is the process of creating material, and editing is the process of turning it into meaning. ”— Teo Macero Chapter 10: Acoustic analysis —— “Auditory structure” created by editingTeo Macero’s editing did not just change the song structure, but also transformed the acoustic space and the very structure of listening. Especially when comparing “In a Silent Way” and “Bitches Brew,” you can see a clear sonic philosophy in the editing direction.       Elements   “In a Silent Way” (1969)   “Bitches Brew” (1970)         Time structure   Cyclic (A→B→A configuration)   Fragmentary/nonlinear       Editing method   Take reversal/loop   Splice + multilayer arrangement       Acoustic sensation   Fluid and meditative   Dense and explosive       Stereo space   Emphasis on spaciousness (left and right separation)   Emphasis on density (center concentration)       Building Rhythm   Emphasizing Groove with Editing   Designing Conflict with Editing       Purpose   Creating “timeless” sound   Building “order of chaos”   These acoustic designs were also the result of taking advantage of the limitations of analog technology at the time. Even the ““cutting noise” and ““unnatural connection” of tape editing were consciously left in by Masero as structural effects. graph LRsubgraph Editing_Structure[ Transformation of acoustic structure (Bitches Brew) ]A[ Take fragments A1 to A9 ] --&gt;|Superposition| B[ Multilayer groove space ]B --&gt;|Effect processing| C[ Increased acoustic density ]C --&gt;|Pan operation/EQ adjustment| D[ Three-dimensional sound construction ]D --&gt;|Final edit| E[ Final track ]endAnalysis supplement: Acoustic features Immersive feeling with loop structure→ Dissolve the listener’s sense of time.

He did not draw a clear line between performance and editing. Rather, that gap was the source of creativity. In modern music production, the acts we unconsciously perform, such as ““cut and loop,” ““automation,” and ““remix,’’ are all extensions of Macero’s philosophy. His accomplishment is nothing less than turning the technology of recording into an art form as an extension of human thinking.  “Editing is putting scissors in time. And the cut time becomes new music. ”— Teo Macero Related diagram: Structure of music generation by editinggraph LRI[ Improvisational material ] --&gt; E[ Theo Macero's compilation ]E --&gt; S[ Configuration (order/length/loop) ]S --&gt; M[ Final work (editing = composition) ]M --&gt; F[ New listening experience ]References/Materials   Paul Tingen, Miles Beyond: The Electric Explorations of Miles Davis, 1967–1991     Mark Levine, The Jazz Theory Book     Brian Eno, A Year with Swollen Appendices  "

    "title": "[Column] DEVO and Energy Dome ─ Utopia and degeneration theory in the technological age",
    "body": "Prologue: What does the red dome mean?Text: mmr｜Theme: Using DEVO’s symbol “Energy Dome” as a clue, deciphering the theory of degeneration, technology, DIY thinking, and the transformation of pop culture In the late 1970s, American new wave band DEVO embodied a new era of pop art, not only with their music but also with their visual iconography. The symbol of this is the red plastic hat they wore on stage and in their music videos – Energy Dome. This strange, futuristic design was more than just a costume. According to DEVO, it is “a device for reusing the energy that humans wastefully emit. ”It was also a device that embodied their philosophy of De-Evolution through humor and irony. Chapter 1: The idea of ​​De-EvolutionThe band name DEVO comes from “De-Evolution” – the paradoxical concept that “humanity is not evolving, but rather degenerating. ”This idea was born in response to the turmoil in America from the late 1960s to the 1970s: the Vietnam War, environmental pollution, and the runaway consumer society. Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale from Akron, Ohio, developed ““doubts about the myth of evolution’’ while studying art and politics. They realized that religious progressivism and belief in technology were ultimately variations on the same fantasy, and conceived of ““degenerate pop’’ to satirize this.  “We’re all DEVO. ”— Mark Mothersbaugh This phrase was both an anti-establishment slogan and a social satire. Chapter 2: Departing from art schoolDEVO has been a “music unit” and a “multimedia project” from the beginning. They will project live slide footage, create handmade videos, and perform performance art. His early film ““The Truth About De-Evolution’’ from 1976 is known as an experimental film documenting American decadence. The film won an award at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1977 and caught the attention of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. After that, DEVO signed a contract with Warner Brothers and released their debut album ““Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are DEVO!’’ (1978) with Brian Eno as producer. Chapter 3: The emergence and semantic structure of the energy domeEnergy Dome first appeared on the band’s 1980 album Freedom of Choice. Its shape is reminiscent of ancient architecture and the stepped pyramids of the Incas. Mark Mothersbaugh later said:  “It was designed according to ancient energy principles — it recycles the energy that escapes from the top of your head. ”(It was designed based on ancient energy principles, recycling the energy that escapes from the top of the head) This word “recycle” is important. For DEVO, technology is not a symbol of domination, but a means of reuse and redefinition. In other words, the Energy Dome is a humor device for “laughing at the system within the system. ” Chapter 4: DIY culture and techno-anarchismDEVO used home-made electronics and synthesizers to create their sound, with a tongue-in-cheek look at commercial rock. Using Roland and ARP synths, they modified their own and reproduced proto-techno loop structures live. This practice can be said to be the prototype of the later Independent/Lo-Fi movement. They satirized the corporate world while taking advantage of corporate methods (logos, slogans, commercialization). In the sense that DEVO itself became a “brand” and presented the contradictions of an anti-capitalist brand, they were also the forerunners of post-modern art groups. Chapter 5: Function as pop ─ “Whip It” and its misconceptionsOn the surface, the 1980 smash hit “Whip It” sounds like just comical synth-pop. However, the lyrics are a parody of anti-heroism, saying, ““Fix the world yourself. ’’DEVO’s humor was not just nonsense, but functioned as a critique of a media-manipulated society. In their music videos, they condense white laboratories, synthesized sounds, and mechanical movements into a pop-cynic format. This is similar to Warhol’s repetitive aesthetic, and is why they are said to be the first musical group to aestheticize irony. Chapter 6: Costume culture as social satireEnergy Dome performed a parody of obedience through futuristic uniforms, while their punk contemporaries expressed rebellion with safety pins and leather. ““Performing obedience is the most radical form of resistance. ’’ That was DEVO’s paradoxical message. The structure can be easily visualized in a diagram as follows: graph TDA[ Social system (capital, technology, mass) ]B[ Personal Obedience ]C[ DEVO's Obedience as Performance (Energy Dome) ]D[ Satire/Criticism/Deconstruction ]A --&gt; BB --&gt; CC --&gt; DThis “performance of obedience” is the gene that later led to Daft Punk and Kraftwerk, as well as today’s anonymous artist culture. Chapter 7: DEVO’s visual culture and anime structureDEVO’s music videos consist of post-anime edits that reflect the information overload of the television generation. Fast-forwarding, replaying in reverse, and emphasizing artificial movements make it seem as if humans themselves have become robot-like beings. This visual style later influenced the production aesthetics of Japan’s ““Detroit Metal City’’ and Perfume. Chapter 8: Reassessment and Reboot since the 90sIn the late 1980s, DEVO went into decline as MTV culture changed. In the 1990s, it was reevaluated as a pioneer of the Internet era. Their self-satirical brand strategy foreshadowed post-Web 2. 0 self-commodification. They reunited in the 2000s and wrote “Something for Everybody” (2010), a satire on “democracy in the age of algorithms. ”In the 2020s, he continues to update his theory of degeneration to include NFTs and AI culture.

In other words, the Energy Dome is a social device that ““transforms’’ with each era. Each time, while making fun of our illusions of “evolution,”It shows us the heretical wisdom of ““affirming degeneration. ’’ Conclusion: Freedom to degenerateDEVO’s message is not just irony, but a philosophy for self-transformation. Under pressure to evolve, they dared to degenerate. Rather, that choice becomes a means of restoring human freedom.  “Freedom of Choice is what you got. Freedom from choice is what you want. ”─ DEVO, Freedom of Choice (1980) Energy dome is not a helmet that closes off the future. Perhaps it is an icon for us to once again have the freedom to choose. — Related materials/references DEVO Official ArchiveDevo – New Traditionalists“New Traditionalists” is the fourth album by US new wave band Devo, released in 1981, and the band’s first completely self-produced album.

    "title": "[Column] Recondite and forest bathing - When techno returns to the forest",
    "body": "Prologue: A beat sinking into the forest      Text: mmr   Theme: German minimal techno artist Recondite. In the music, you can hear the breathing of the forest in its artificial sequences. Here we explore the philosophical intersection of his work and forest bathing (Shinrin-yoku).    Recondite――real name Lorenz Brunner. When many people hear his music for the first time, they feel a sense of ““loneliness” and ““tranquility. ”However, deep down, there is a tension between nature and technology. For Brunner, who grew up in the Bavarian forests of southern Germany, sound is not a product of the city;It was an organic thing born out of fog and humidity, wind and shadow. In recent years, the term ““forest bathing’’ (Shinrin-yoku) has been attracting worldwide attention, even in Japan. It is not just healing, but the act of reconnecting human senses to the natural environment. This concept and Recondite’s sonic world are strangely intimate. His minimal tracks are like walking through a digital forest. Chapter 1: The phenomenon called ReconditeSince their debut in 2011, Recondite has carved out a unique position in the progressive techno scene. While distancing himself from Berlin’s club culture, he combined solitude and nature motifs. Representative works:  “On Acid” (2012) — Reconstructing the acid sound of Roland TB-303 in humid air.  “Hinterland” (2013) — An album with the motif of the scenery of my hometown. A melody that traces the ridgeline of a mountain.  “Iffy” (2014) — An introspective beat and a tone that feels like a fleeting moment of light in a forest.  “Dwell” (2020) — A work born during a time of isolation. The theme is a return to nature. Chapter 2: Forest SoundscapeAnalyzing Recondite’s music, it is characterized by “breathing in the low range” and “humidity in the midrange. ”Kick is always subdued, instead letting the reverberations of the synths express the layers of air between the trees. This structure corresponds to the mechanism by which forest bathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system in humans.  Forest bathing uses multiple stimuli such as natural sounds, light, smells, and humidity. It is said to reduce stress hormones in humans (Forestry Agency survey, 2004). At Recondite’s live performances, it feels as if a ““electronic leaf rub’’ envelopes the venue. Although it is artificial nature reproduced with digital equipment,For some reason, the listener feels the illusion of being closer to the forest. Chapter 3: The intersection of techno and ecologyTechno music is often described as urban, mechanical, and inorganic. But Recondite’s approach is the opposite. He treats synths as “an extension of the landscape. ” Environmental philosopher Timothy Morton proposed the concept of “dark ecology. ”It is impossible for humans to completely separate from nature, and we should rather accept an uncomfortable mixed state. Recondite’s music embodies this philosophy. An artificial drum machine mimics the heartbeat of the forest, and a sequencer recreates the rhythm of the wind. It is a sound ecology that depicts the ambiguous coexistence of nature and man-made. Chapter 4: Forest Bathing Rhythm and MeditationIn forest bathing, it is recommended to ““walk slowly” and ““focus on breathing. ”Recondite’s tracks similarly follow a moderately fast tempo (approximately 110-118 BPM). His beats are meditative and designed to sync with the listener’s heartbeat. From musical psychology, it is known that a certain tempo promotes a state in which the parasympathetic nervous system is dominant. Therefore, the Recondite live experience is more than just a club event;It can be said that it functions as “Forest Bathing in the City. ” Chapter 5: Digital Sea of ​​Trees - Integrating Visuals and SoundsRecondite also produces his own visuals. Misty mountains, silhouetted trees, and frozen lakes. Together with sound, they construct an “electronic landscape”. This visual method can be considered a form of immersive ecological expression in techno. In other words, his live performance is a sound forest bathing device. It is a reproduction of a digital forest that leads human senses to natural memory. Chapter 6: Recondite and Japan - the intersection of forest cultureWhat is interesting is that when Recondite visited Japan,““I was deeply influenced by the tranquility of Japan’s forests,’’ he said (from a 2018 interview). Unlike Western forests, Japan’s ““forest signs’’ have a mythical introspection. This influence is evident in the minimalism of his later works.  “Silence in Japan is not empty. It has presence. ”— Recondite, Tokyo Interview, 2018 This ““silence as existence’’ is the very essence of forest bathing. Silence makes sound stand out. His music is an electronic translation of that philosophy. Chapter 7: Chronology of works (relationship with Nature)timelinetitle Recondite and the evolution of natural motifs (2011–2025)2011 :  Placid  EP — Early work with the theme of lake reflections2012 :  On Acid  — Exploration of organic acid sound2013 :  Hinterland  — A concept album depicting the forest of my hometown2014 :  Iffy  — Psychological landscape of light and shadow2016 :  Daemmerlicht  — Forest at dawn with piano and ambient music2020 :  Dwell  — Isolation and return to nature2023 :  Taiga  — A fictional soundscape themed around the boreal forest. Chapter 8: Acoustic Analysis - Forest Rhythmic StructureWhen you analyze the waveform of Recondite’s track,Designed to organically fluctuate the mid-high range in the 2-6kHz band. This is close to the spectrum of wind and tree rustling sounds. graph LRA[ Low range (50-120Hz) ] --&gt;|Respiration/heart rate| B[ Medium range (250-2kHz) ]B --&gt;|Leaf rustling/wind| C[ High range (2-6kHz) ]C --&gt;|Reverberations of the forest| D[ Psychological calming ]This “hierarchical structure of sound” isIt imitates the process by which natural sounds stabilize the human psyche. Chapter 9: Philosophical Considerations - The Self as a ForestThe act of listening to Recondite’s works isIt is an experience of not only ““feeling nature” but also ““assimilating with nature. ”It’s like aural forest bathing. The philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty““The body is part of the world, and sensations are phenomena of interaction with the world. ’’Recondite’s music electronically implements this phenomenological perspective. In other words, it presents a new physicality called Music = Forest of Sensory. Chapter 10: Conclusion - Techno returns to the forestRecondite’s music is not mechanical nature, butIt maintains a balance like a machine breathing in nature. If forest bathing is an act of ““returning humans to nature,’’Recondite’s music is an act of “returning techno to nature. ”Artificial and organic, city and forest, beat and silence - all of them melt together in him. It resonates as a new ““poetics of digital nature. ’’  Listen to Recondite as if you were taking a forest bath. That’s the moment when we remember that techno is “alive” again.

    "title": "[Column] The Pop Group - The rebellious sound and historical background born in Bristol",
    "body": "Prologue: The seeds of an explosion that the era is pregnant with      Text: mmr   Theme: A rebellious music movement that exploded in Bristol, England at the end of the 1970s - tracing the intersection of politics and art played by The Pop Group, and its impact along with the historical background.    In 1978, an unusual band appeared in the port city of Bristol in southwestern England. Its name is The Pop Group. Although they called themselves pop, their music was not funk, punk, or jazz, but rather an experiment in which all genres collided explosively. Their sound evokes the unemployment, class, political corruption, and alienation of young people that covered England in the 1970s. It was sublimated as a “scream” of the sound itself. It wasn’t just music, it was ““anti-establishment physical expression” and ““an art that brings together fragments of ideas. ” The city of Bristol is a port city with a history of slave trade and a multicultural mix. The musical movement born here was also the birthplace of the trip-hop culture that would eventually lead to Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky. The Pop Group was the origin and first “voice of rebellion”. Chapter 1: The birth of the city of Bristol (1970–1977)Bristol in the 1970s was an ostensibly peaceful provincial town. However, behind the scenes, social divisions, economic stagnation, and alienation of immigrant communities were progressing. Similar to the 1976 Brixton Riots (London), conflicts between police and young people intensified in Bristol. A ““disconnect between the state and the streets’’ became the norm. As a port city, Bristol had a reggae and dub culture rooted in it due to immigrants from Jamaica. The rhythm, the low center of gravity of the bass, and the spirit of rebellion,It also permeated the white rock youth. It was in this cultural mix that the young people of The Pop Group grew up. At school, he listened to punk and funk, and at night he would hang out at sound systems in immigrant neighborhoods. They absorbed the very magnetic field of the city, where ““anger,” ““mixed race,” ““politics,” and ““Beat” were swirling. Chapter 2: The Birth and Rebellion of The Pop Group (1978–1980)1978 - A sound that disrupted all genresThe members are in their late teens to early 20s. Mark Stewart (vocals), Gareth Sager (guitar), Bruce Smith (drums),Dan Catsis (bass), John Waddington (guitar) were the main players. Unlike the London punks, they were conscious of being political and artistic. Their debut album, ““Y’’ (1979), was a heresy of a heresy even at the time. The disorder of free jazz, the deep space of dub, the destructive impulse of punk…These intersect as socially critical poems and poetic cries.  “We Are All Prostitutes”    It was a poignant declaration against a society sold out to commercialism and the system.  This song”s rhythmic violence, swells of noise, and Mark Stewart”s curse-like vocals areIt can be said to be the prototype of later industrial/political noise. Chapter 3: Fusion of thought and sound - “Resistance as art”What set The Pop Group apart from other punk bands was thatHe clearly had the understanding that ““music = a weapon of thought’‘**. They were influenced by Marxism, Situationism, and the philosophies of Bataille and Derrida. Themes such as “power,” “surveillance,” and “media manipulation” appear repeatedly in the lyrics. Acoustically, we took advantage of the recording technology of the time,Made extensive use of spatial processing, reverb, tape manipulation, and improvisation. This was later developed by Adrian Sherwood (On-U Sound) and Lee Perry. It also overlaps with the prototype of “political dub. ”  Sound was not just entertainment, but noise for resistance. Chapter 4: Deconstruction and Rebirth - Chain of Post-Pop GroupsIn 1980, The Pop Group suddenly disbanded. After that, each member takes a different path.  Mark Stewart: Collaborated with Adrian Sherwood as a solo artist and established Industrial Dub.  Gareth Sager and Bruce Smith: Formed Rip Rig + Panic. A young Neneh Cherry was also there.  Dan Catsis: He remained at the foundation of Bristol music, later becoming involved with Massive Attack. This divergence gave rise to the diversity of the Bristol sound. Trip hop, dub, experimental music, political hip hop…The influence of The Pop Group is etched into all of them. Chapter 5: Reassessment and revival in the 21st centuryThe Pop Group has long been a cult figure. Since the 2000s, it has been reevaluated amidst the post-punk revival trend. Especially since 2005, following the Gang of Four and Wire reunions,They also resumed their activities in 2010. In 2015, he released his new work ““Citizen Zombie. ’’ While the violent nature of the sound was still present, it was more political and had a sharper message than before. For them, ““reunion” was not about nostalgia, but ““continuation of resistance. ”  “You don”t stop being angry because time passes. ”― Mark Stewart (1958–2023) Mark Stewart’s death marked the end of an era. However, his voice still resonates even in a modern society covered with AI and surveillance capitalism. It continues to resonate as an “echo of resistance. ” Chapter 6: Genes to Bristol CultureThe seeds planted by The Pop Group would soon be passed on to other artists in Bristol.  Massive Attack - “Soundscape” themed around politics and urban darkness.  Portishead - Sublimating repressed emotions into sonic experiments Tricky - A fusion of bass and poetic violenceAlthough these artists directly seem to belong to different genres,At the root of all of this is a common ““musical spirit that resists society. ’’In other words,  ”The Pop Group’s ethics’’ = sonic resistance. Conclusion: Explosive Thoughts, Silent PoliticsThe Pop GroupHe posed the questions, ““What is music?” and ““What can art do about politics?”Their sound continues to refuse to answer that question. What they left behind was not an answer but the question itself. That is Bristol’s greatest legacy.

    "body": "Prologue: The Mythos of DJ HarveyText: mmr｜Theme: Not just a DJ, but a consideration of the last “shaman” of the analog era DJ Harvey - Just hearing that name makes many club freaks’ faces go slack. Co-founder of the legendary London club Tonka Sound System, he rose to fame in the 90s as a resident at Ministry of Sound, moved to Ibiza in the 2000s, and is now based in Los Angeles. Harvey says. “Records are fragments of my soul. When the needle drops, God dwells there. ”These words tell us everything about his view of DJing. In the 21st century, where digitalization has progressed, he still believes in ““music as a substance’’. That faith is what makes DJ Harvey a legend. Chapter 1: The era when records are “alive”London in the 1980s. Harvey was immersed in street culture through skateboarding and punk. However, he eventually started frequenting record stores and became obsessed with the charm of 12-inch singles. At that time, records were not just a sound source, but a culture that could be accessed. The texture of the jacket, the smell of the liner notes, the depth of the cut. All of that was part of the “musical experience. ” The first album he bought was Grace Jones’ ““Pull Up to the Bumper’‘. The moment his body moved to that bassline, Harvey realized his destiny as a DJ.  “For me, records are like breathing. I breathe in sound and let it out. That’s it. ” This sense of “breathing” later gave rise to his mixing philosophy: “Connecting through air, not tempo. ” Chapter 2: The essence of Harvey’s dig cultureDJ Harvey’s record collection is more than just a collection. For him, a record is ““the act of keeping a record of someone else’s life. ’’Wandering around markets and flea markets, digging up dusty records. There are not only sounds but also traces of time engraved there. Harvey says, “The more a record has human fingerprints on it, the more alive the sound is. ”His set includes a mix of unknown Italo disco, 70s rock, 80s synth boogie, and Hawaiian AOR. The selection of songs is not random, but based on an intuition of reading the ““airflow of sound’’. His DJ bag is like a travel journal. Each record contains memories of some night. Chapter 3: London - Ibiza - LA, a moving record boxHarvey’s records have always been on the move. From underground clubs in London to Pikes Hotel in Ibiza to warehouse events in LA. As cities change, so do the sounds. He reconfigures the set to suit the mood. During his time in Ibiza, Harvey redefined the word ‘Balearic’. It wasn’t a genre, it was a ““feeling that melts boundaries’‘**. Rock, house, and funk all blend together under the same sun. This freedom became the style that would later become the symbol of Harvey’s Set.   ”In Ibiza, the weight of the record boxes felt comfortable. That weight was proof that music existed in reality. “ Chapter 4: Sense of distance between sound and bodyHarvey’s DJing is more physical than technical. Place the needle, twist the EQ, move the fader smoothly. The series of movements is like a dance. He places emphasis on ““grooves in which humans can shift, rather than grooves calculated by computers. ’’That’s why his play is always raw. At the same time, this is the same root of his record collecting philosophy. Distortion, noise, and scratch sounds on the disc. Accept everything as “physicality of music”.  “The scars of the sound are beautiful. ” These words lie at the heart of Harvey’s aesthetic. Chapter 5: Analog Ethics in the Digital AgeToday, many DJs can travel the world with a single USB stick. But Harvey still goes on tour with a box of records. For him, it is a ritual to “reconnect with sound through inconvenience. ” On the other hand, he does not deny digital. His label “Locussolus” combines analog recording and digital editing. In other words, what is important to him is the continuation of the ““physical touch’’, and the medium in which it resides is secondary. In a digitally abstracted world, his records continue to shine as ““tactile records. ’’ Final chapter: From collection to liberation - coexistence with musicDJ Harvey recently said in an interview:  “I”m not a “collector’ anymore. I just live with music. ” In these words, there is the freedom that I have reached at the end of my DJ career of over 40 years. Collecting records was not an act of “owning” music, but rather a way of living time together. The walls of his house are lined with analog records. However, they are by no means static archives. Every time Harvey drops the needle, the time on the board comes to life again. At that moment, the boundaries between past and present, analog and digital, body and sound disappear. **DJ Harvey and record collecting–this is the philosophy of ““living with sound’’ itself. ** Chronology: DJ Harvey’s History (1980–2025)timelinetitle DJ Harvey Chronology (1980–2025)1980: Passionate about skate culture and punk in London1985 : Forms Tonka Sound System and joins rave culture1990: Became resident DJ at Ministry of Sound1995: Established a unique style combining house and rock2000 : Balearic redefined at Pikes Hotel in Ibiza2005: Moved to America and started activities based in LA2010: Project Locussolus started, returning to analog production2017 : Boiler Room appearance, re-evaluation boom2020:  DJ Harvey is the Sound  exhibition held (London)2025: Continue to work as an ambassador of analog culture around the worldDJ Harvey’s sonic cosmic structureflowchart TDA[ Record Collecting ]B[ Selection ]C[ Mixing ]D[ Atmosphere ]E[ Body ]F[ Transcendence ]A --&gt; B --&gt; C --&gt; D --&gt; E --&gt; Fsubgraph HarveyWorld[ DJ Harvey's Sonic Philosophy ]direction TBABCDEFendConclusionDJ Harvey plays the records of the past as the sounds of the future.

    "body": "1. Prologue: Where space disco was bornText: mmr｜Theme: Tracing the unique sound philosophy created by a different-dimensional mix, speed manipulation, and the fusion of folk music and electronic sounds. Late 1970s, on the shores of Lake Garda in northern Italy. Little did anyone know that this place, which was just a resort for tourists, would later become the center of an acoustic phenomenon called Cosmic Sound. The central figure is Daniele Baldelli. He is not just a DJ, but has become known as an ““architect who reconstructs the speed of sound and space. ’’ The disco scene at the time was dominated by 4/4 rhythm, which was represented by American soul and house music. However, Baldelli interweaves ethnic music, electronic sounds, progressive rock, African drums, and even krautrock. We presented the concept of “cosmic tempo”, which allows you to freely change the BPM.  “I don’t believe in genres. I only believe in the flow of sound. ”― Daniele Baldelli 2. What is Cosmic Sound? - An indefinable acoustic experienceCosmic Sound is often translated as “cosmic disco. ”But that doesn’t just mean sci-fi sound design. Rather, it refers to DJ play that distorts time and gravity itself. Characteristic elements   Tempo Fluidity:Plays a 45rpm record at 33rpm and further adjusts the pitch by more than ±8%. This makes the same track sound like a signal from an unknown planet.     Cultural Mixture:A mix of German krautrock (Can, Neu!), African music, electronic ambient, and Italian synth disco. It’s like an extraterrestrial jukebox.     Ritual:At Cosmic Club, lights and mirror balls are suppressed, and instead smoke and projectors dominate the space. Rather than dancing, the audience had an experience of being ““immersed’’ in the sound.  3. Baldelli’s playing philosophy - A revolution in consciousness toward “speed”Daniele Baldelli’s real innovation was in treating speed (tempo) as a musical element. he speaks.   ”It’s easy to mix music genres. However, ““cosmizing’’ them at one speed is a matter of sensibility, not technology. “ His mixes range from 110 BPM funk to 85 BPM Afro percussion to slowed-down synth ambient. Transfers smoothly. You can’t even feel the boundaries between songs. Throughout the night it feels like a spaceship is going down and out of orbit. 4. Sound material science - Relocation of sound sources in CosmicBaldelli was a pioneer of DJs who treated songs as “material. ”There was a strong sense of ““composing’’ the recorded sounds again on the turntable.       Sources used   Specific examples         Kraftwerk   Kraftwerk, Can, Ash Ra Tempel       Italian electronic music   Claudio Gizzi, Tullio De Piscopo       Afro/ethnic sounds   Manu Dibango, Fela Kuti       Space theme   Space, Rockets, Cerrone       Soundtrack   Morricone, Carpenter, Goblin   This multicultural mix was the precursor to later Balearic Sound, Leftfield Disco, as well as Downtempo and Nu Disco. 5. Internal structure of Cosmic Club - Sound field as architectureplace:”“Discoteca Cosmic’’ on the shores of Lake Garda, Northern Italy (1979–1984) Features: Low ceilings and unique echoes Smoke + laser irradiation on the floor Baldelli’s DJ booth is installed on a hill and has a structure that showers sound from above the audience.  A space dominated by “darkness” rather than lightAt this club, ““drifting” was more important than ““dancing. ”Visitors are transported by the sound and lose their sense of time. Cosmic was ““meditation in the night’‘**. 6. Baldelli technology – the magic of analogThe equipment he uses has distinct features that set him apart from other disco DJs.  Technics SL-1200 (2 units) + Revox tape deck Roland Space Echo RE-201 Eko Multitone EQ Sample loop with Reel-to-Reel tapeUsing these, he created a live performance “rhythmic breath”. Using tape repeat, the same sound is rearranged with a slight shift. It can be said that this was the prehistory of later sampler music. 7. Inheritance and variation – from Cosmic to BalearicIn the late 1980s, Ibiza”s DJ Alfredo and José Padilla inherited Baldelli”s Cosmic philosophy. This developed into a trend called ““Balearic Beat,’’ which later fundamentally changed UK club culture.       Genealogy   Representative people         Cosmic (Northern Italy)   Daniele Baldelli, Beppe Loda       Balearic (Ibiza)   DJ Alfredo, José Padilla       UK Chillout/Nu Disco   Andrew Weatherall, The Orb, Prins Thomas   This trend is not just a “music genre”;It was the international spread of the ““sensation of flowing sound over time**. 8.

Conclusion: To dance at the speed of the universeCosmic Sound is the most undefinable area in disco history. There, genre, country, speed, and culture blend together, and a “philosophy of sound” emerges. Daniele Baldelli presented the philosophy as a “translation into space. ” Some of today’s DJs, especially artists who work with slower tempos and cross-cultural material (Harvey, Tornado Wallace, Young Marco, etc. ),That DNA is certainly alive and well.  “Cosmic means searching for the inner universe, not the universe. ”― Daniele Baldelli Discography   Baldelli, Daniele.

    "title": "[Column] Wu-Tang Clan and Japanese anime culture: Resonance between oriental thought and the street",
    "body": "Prologue: From Brooklyn to Edo - The cultural apparatus of the Wu-Tang ClanText: mmr｜Theme: Hip-hop and Japanese anime–Exploring the intersection of “Oriental thought” and “street spirit” demonstrated by the Wu-Tang Clan 1993, Staten Island, New York, USA. From there, a group called “Xiaolin” emerged that shocked the history of hip-hop. Wu-Tang Clan - The chain of combative and philosophical words woven by nine MCs was a strange form of art that combined street violence with Buddhist tranquility. At the core of their worldview, kung fu movies, oriental philosophy, and ““anime imagination’‘ coexisted. For black American youth in the 1990s, Asian culture was an ““exotic spiritual weapon’’ and a means of escape from social oppression. Wu-Tang Clan sampled Bruce Lee, Sun Tzu, and Lao Tzu, and later resonated strongly with the aesthetics of Japanese anime. Chapter 1: Shaolin Thought and Anime Combat AestheticsThe word “Shaolin” appears repeatedly in Wu-Tang Clan’s early works. This is not just an Asian hobby. For them, “Shaolin” was a metaphor for inner training, training oneself in the midst of poverty and violence. This structure is similar to Japanese anime, especially ““Dragon Ball,” ““Fist of the North Star,” and ““Naruto. ’’Both Son Goku and Kenshiro transcend themselves through combat with external enemies. RZA (Wu-Tang’s spiritual leader) later said:  “Anime warriors were our life. They trained themselves in solitude and fought against the world. “ This ““spiritual shaolin = story of training’’ has a structure similar to the street struggle. The ““samurai self-image” held by Wu-Tang Clan members became the prototype for the ““anime-like stoicism” that later spread throughout hip-hop. Chapter 2: Asia as Sampling - From Kung Fu to AnimeIn his 1993 debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),The audio from the kung fu movie ““Shaolin Thirty-Six Chambers’’ is sampled. Since then, Asian sound motifs have frequently appeared in Wu-Tang’s music. Mokugyo, the koto, the shakuhachi, the sound of temple bells – these were symbols of the “Orient” as sounds. However, in the 2000s, his interest expanded to ““Japanese anime. ’’RZA showed strong respect for Nujabes, who was the music supervisor for “Samurai Champloo”. Ghostface Killah expanded his alias from “Tony Starks” to “Iron Man”. He later became involved in producing the soundtrack for Afro Samurai. At this point, Asian culture moves from mere quotation to the realm of co-production = collaboration. Chapter 3: “Afro Samurai” and the chain of reimportsIn 2007, the Japanese anime ““Afro Samurai’’ was broadcast nationwide. The voice actor is Samuel L. Jackson. RZA was in charge of the music. This work was a true ““mutual remix’’ of Japanese and American culture, created by a Japanese studio and told by a black American artist. “Samurai” is no longer a foreign warrior, but has been redefined as an embodiment of hip-hop ethics.  “Sword = Mike” “War = Rap Battle”This symbolic transformation is at the heart of post-Wu-Tang Clan hip-hop aesthetics. For RZA, ““Afro Samurai” is the work that most concretely embodies his ““Oriental orientation. ”At the same time, it became a pioneer of ““fusion with hip-hop’’ for the Japanese anime industry. Chapter 4: A new horizon for hip-hop opened up by an anime-like worldviewAfter Wu-Tang Clan, hip-hop acquired the ““language to talk about anime. ’’Tyler, The Creator references “Akira” and “Neon Genesis Evangelion”,Kanye West depicts an anime-like world in the MV for “Strong Feeling”,Lil Uzi Vert and Megan Thee Stallion proudly incorporate “otaku culture” into their identities. All of these phenomena are an extension of the ““window to Oriental fantasy’’ opened by Wu-Tang. In recent years, RZA has continued to cite Japanese spirituality as a “metaphor for how to live” in works such as “Bong of the Dead. ” In other words, Wu-Tang Clan’s “Asian orientation” is not just cultural appropriation;It was a process in which the oppressed black community reconstructed itself through outside knowledge. Chapter 5: Response from Japan - The intersection of anime, music, and the streetsIn Japan, the influence of the Wu-Tang Clan was slowly spreading. Artists like DJ Krush, Nujabes, and Shing02. It emphasized the “Zen” aspect of hip-hop and resonated with RZA’s spiritual world. In particular, Nujabes’ music combines sampling and the aesthetics of ma. He was spiritually connected to the Wu-Tang Clan, the “Samurai of Sound. ” In the 2020s, clear references appear in Japanese anime works. The influence of lo-fi hip-hop can be seen in the BGM of “Jujutsu Kaisen”. Multiple hip-hop artists will participate in the ending of “Chainsaw Man. ”Here, anime once again reconnects with the language of the “street. ” Conclusion: Sword and Microphone - At the intersection of two training groundsThe “East” seen by the Wu-Tang Clan is not a figment of imagination;It was a structural diversion to introduce philosophical elements such as self-discipline, serenity, and spiritual unity into a world of violence. At the same time, it is in line with the ““stories of battle and growth’’ that Japanese anime has depicted. Street MCs sharpen their rap skills like a sword,Anime characters transcend themselves through “training. ”These two stories transcend cultural barriers and converge into one spiritual archetype: the poetics of the warrior. Today, hip-hop and anime share the same global myth. It’s no coincidence that the Wu-Tang Clan got its start. Their “microphone path” isIt was truly a modern-day translation of “Samurai Spirit. ” Chronology: Intersection of Wu-Tang Clan and Japanese culture (1993–2025)timelinetitle Wu-Tang Clan × Japanese Culture Timeline (1993–2025)1993:  Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)  released.

However, their true stage was in the spiritual dojo = music. Just as Japanese anime depicts human growth through battle,They too have continued to train their souls through “sound and poetry. ” This attitude is still alive in contemporary artists. Anime characters and rappers are all facing the same question. “How to train yourself and how to fight against the world” That is the greatest legacy left by the Wu-Tang Clan. "

    "title": "[Column] MERZBOW ── Noise, the liberating acoustics",
    "body": "Prologue: Noise as the inversion of silenceText: mmr｜Theme: Exploring the philosophy and cultural historical significance of noise music pioneered by Masami Akita/Merzbow Since the 1980s, the ““noise music’’ that originated in Japan has followed a unique trajectory in the history of world music. The person who has continued to stand at the center of this is Masami Akita (Merzbow). His sound is violent yet meditative, destructive yet organic. It goes beyond the framework of ““music” and should instead be seen as an ““aural philosophical experiment. ” The name Merzbow comes from Schulz’s Dada-like collage work ““Merzbau’’. In other words, the very act of dismantling existing structures and reconstructing the fragments is his creative principle. Akita has been active for over 40 years, but his philosophy has always been ““the politics of listening’’. Noise is not just “noisy sound”, but a counterattack of sounds that have been excluded from the social order. Background: Japan’s avant-garde soil and DIY cultureAt the end of the 1970s, Tokyo’s underground was filled with a diverse spirit of experimentation. The context of contemporary music by Yuji Takahashi and Toru Takemitsu, the impulses of punk/free jazz, and the happening practices of the art world intersect. During this time, Akita studied the history of art at an art university and explored the relationship between the body and sound. Early Merzbow was developed as an ““action art’’ that involved the audience and the space through live noise, similar to action painting. Also, the cassette culture (cassette underground) supported his expression. The DIY spirit of home recording + mailing network was a precursor to what would later become an Internet-like phenomenon. Aesthetics: Noise = pleasure of demolitionMerzbow’s aesthetic lies in ““regeneration, not destruction’’. His noise shatters all genres, structures, harmony, and emotions, but then a new order emerges. The infinite folding of sound particles pushes the listener’s hearing to new sensory horizons.  “Noise is the sound of freedom. No one can control it. ”─ Masami Akita (Interview, 1994) Merzbow’s creative process is often compared to the structure of an ecosystem. Analog noise (feedback, tape loops, effects running wild) and post-digital glitchy precision intertwine like biological mutations. There exists a ““resonance between inorganic and organic’’. Equipment and production process: acoustic “ecosystem”In the early days, the focus was on ““physical noise’’ directly connected to metal junk, amplifiers, microphones, magnetic tape, effectors, etc. In the mid-1990s, with the introduction of Macs and digital devices, the granularity and controllability of sound suddenly changed. However, Akita does not aim at control, but instead shifts to experiments to find the ““point of collapse of control. ’’ His studio is an organism of its own, with its myriad analog devices and patch cables intertwined. Merzbow’s “sound” is a record of the mutual interference process between humans and machines. Social context: animal welfare and anti-capitalismSince the 2000s, Akita has openly advocated animal rights movements and veganism, and has begun to incorporate these ideas into his music. In his representative works ““Animal Liberation” and ““Ecoid” series, he redefined noise as a critique of anthropocentrism. In other words, noise is not just a sound, but takes on the meaning of an ecological resistance movement. Merzbow’s music is also the antithesis of the capitalist commodity form. Despite being the opposite of “music that sells,” the paradox of receiving high acclaim at festivals and museums around the world was born. International influence: making noise a global languageSince the 1990s, Merzbow has been mythologised through underground networks around the world. Its influence extended to many artists such as Wolf Eyes (US), Prurient (US), and Alva Noto (Germany). His ““Japanese noise’’ became an important reference point for Western critics as well, as it represents the coexistence of Oriental tranquility and violence. In the 2000s, the noise scene spread to Indonesia, Russia, and South America. At the root of this is the philosophy established by Merzbow: ““Anyone can dismantle the world with sound. ’’ Current: Noise after AIIn the 2020s, as music generation by AI becomes commonplace, Merzbow’s presence is once again gaining traction. His noise became a symbol of ““the non-algorithmic chaos of human consciousness. ’’The more orderly and beautiful the generative music becomes, the more Merzbow’s “chaos” stands up as traces of real life. The “distortion of consciousness” that cannot be reproduced with AI noise is the human reality that his sound emits. It is the last wild thing against the ““music without body’’ of the 21st century. Conclusion: Noise is proof of lifeMerzbow’s sound is no longer a genre. It is an extension of the fundamental impulse of ““living = listening. ’’Incorporating even silence into noise, he has recorded the vibration of existence itself at the extreme of sound.  “Noise is the voice of life that has not yet been named. ” Chronology: Merzbow’s trajectorytimelinetitle Merzbow activity timeline (1979–2025)1979: Formed Merzbow.

    "body": "Prologue: The day Chord took the stage      Text: mmr   Theme: The culture of playing chords and music generated by AI. Explore the creative changes occurring at that intersection.    In the darkness of the club, what appears on the screen are not notes but chords. “d1 $ sound “bd sn [hh*2]”“──It was not a musical score, but an improvised algorithm. This culture called “Live Coding” was born in Sheffield, England in the early 2000s. Artists write programs in real time on stage and immediately output them as sound. A fusion of music and coding, club culture and algorithms. This new expression would later resonate deeply with AI music. Chapter 1: Birth of a culture of “playing” chordsThe origins of Live Coding lie in Algorithmic Composition. The earliest examples include automatic composition experiments by Lejaren Hiller and Iannis Xenakis in the 1950s. Live Coding has carried this into the 21st century and brought back physicality and real-time functionality. In 2004, the community “TOPLAP” was proposed by Alex McLean and Nick Collins. The slogan was ““Show us your screens!’’By sharing the process (code) of producing sound with the audience,The idea was to turn the production process itself into a performance. Environments such as TidalCycles, SuperCollider, and Sonic Pi areEnables the act of “writing sounds by hand” improvisationally,It brought a new live nature to electronic music. Chapter 2: Transformation of generation brought about by AIIn the context of AI music, music generation using deep learning made significant progress in the late 2010s. Representative examples include OpenAI”s “Jukebox,” Google”s “Magenta,” and “Riffusion. ” AI doesn’t write code. Instead, it learns patterns from large amounts of data and “internalizes” production rules. In other words, AI is algorithmic intelligence that is “outside” of Live Coding. However, in recent years, the boundaries have rapidly become blurred. For example, TidalCycles users use GPT to suggest codes in real time,Cases are beginning to appear where AI analyzes live performances and predicts the next rhythm. This fusion points to a future where AI becomes a co-star in Live Coding. Chapter 3: Differences between human improvisation and machine “improvisation”Human Live Coders enjoy errors and chance. Unexpected sounds and misunderstandings drive the music. On the other hand, AI improvisation is “reconstruction” based on past data,Essentially it remains within the bounds of probability. However, this difference is also the source of creativity. AI provides infinite combinations, and humans find meaning in them. The relationship between the two is not one of “dominance and subordination,” but rather a mutually complementary creative relationship.

Generate responsive mixes in real time. As a result, we were able to co-star in a form where the AI ​​follows the “human rhythm”.     Algorave × GPT Jam (2024, Tokyo)Multiple Live Coders receive GPT-based code suggestions on stage,Perform while making corrections on the spot. Chats from the audience are used as input data. An attempt was made to have AI read the ““atmosphere of the place. ’’     Riffusion＋Tidal LoopTidalCycles randomly rearranges the fragmented sounds generated by AI,A new production format in which AI is in charge of “materials” and humans are in charge of “structure”.  Chapter 6: Ethics and Creativity - What is a “performer” in the age of automation?Who owns the copyright when AI writes code?Does the concept of “original” hold true in improvisational production? These questions are closely related to the philosophy of Live Coding. TOPLAP’s philosophy of “opening up the process” isTransparency = democratization of creativity. When AI joins this culture,We need to resist the “black box”. If a generative AI proposes a code, its learning process and decision criteria should also be made public. This is the key to unlocking the future of algorithmic music. Chapter 7: Future prospects - Towards “algorithm-driven collaboration”In the 2030s, “AI sessions” will become commonplace in music production. AI is not just a tool, but is positioned as a co-performer. Humans direct the direction of concepts and emotions,AI improvises hundreds of sound patterns. The act of selecting and editing from there is itself a “performance. ” Furthermore, by integrating the Live Coding environment with AI,There is also a possibility that it will become a “prompt = performance interface. ”No longer need a mouse or MIDI. The era when language and thoughts themselves become sounds is coming.

He opened up music to an act that anyone could create. AI will further promote democratization,We are trying to create a culture of sharing the “intelligence of performing”. Algorithms and humans, machines and emotions. Where the boundaries melt,A new musical horizon rises.  Chords transcend sheet music, and AI learns to improvise. Music is no longer a “human exclusive patent”;Co-Creative Intelligence. "

The quivering lines, the contrast between black and white, and the gaps in the page structure convey both silence and noise at the same time. In that sense, his manga can be called ““comics that are like music. ’’ Chapter 1: Debut and early activities (1976–1983) 1976: Won the 12th Tezuka Prize for ““Urashima’’ and debuted as a manga artist. He is attracting attention as the youngest person to be selected.  1981: Moved to the United States and participated in commercial production at Richard Williams Animation Inc. Learn the importance of movement and rhythm through animation techniques.  1983: ““LANDED” published in Marvel’s ““Epic Illustrated. ”Expand the range of visual expression by presenting your work internationally. During this period, the foundations of temporal/rhythmic expression in line and screen composition were established. Chapter 2: First book and SF expression (1986–1990)   1986: First book “SPINOZA” published (Sakushasha). Characterized by philosophical themes and abstract visuals. Visual musicality is revealed by adjusting the density of lines, screen composition, and temporal rhythm.     1988: Published ““Katajikenai” (Hakusensha) and ““G (GATE 1)” (Schola). The tense lines in the sci-fi setting and the expression of the human body are like musical polyrhythms.  Chapter 3: “ULTRA HEAVEN” – Music of hallucinations and consciousness (2002–)   2002: “ULTRA HEAVEN” published (Enterbrain). The theme is hallucinatory experiences, splitting of consciousness, and altered sense of time. The page structure and panel layout function as a musical structure (repetition, variation, wave).     2003: Publication of short story collection ““HEAVEN’S DOOR”, reprint of previously published ““G”. Precise lines and visual rhythms give the reader a musical experience.     2005: Volume 2 of “ULTRA HEAVEN” published. Long-term serialization deepens the spiritual world and refines the composition and lines.     2009: Volume 3 of “ULTRA HEAVEN” published. The new books released once every four years are a real drag to read.  Chapter 4: Characteristics of style and techniqueRhythm of lines Subtle fluctuations in the lines act as visual noise Dense lines act as a flood of sound, and blank spaces act as silence. Musicality of frame division Repetition/variation/phase shift arrangement The rhythm changes page by page, and the reader’s eye movements are similar to a “musical performance”Motif Life, consciousness, hallucinations, philosophical themes Depicting psychological and physiological rhythms through science fiction devices and human body expressionsChapter 5: Cultural historical contextKeiichi Koike’s style resonates with Japanese science fiction manga and foreign science fiction art from the 1990s onwards.  Katsuhiro Otomo’s information density and structural beauty Tsutomu Nihei’s physiological discomfort The otherworldly feeling of foreign science fiction writers (Moebius, Bilal)While influenced by these influences, Koike is unique in that he translates consciousness and rhythm into a manga style.

    "title": "[Column] Ig Nobel Prize and music - another harmony of science and humor",
    "body": "The sound between laughter and discoveryText: mmr｜Theme: When music meets the Ig Nobel Prize, where will the boundary between science and art go?  “Things that first make people laugh, then make them think. ”    Ig Nobel Prize philosophy (Improbable Research) 1. Prologue: Where science and music meetThe Ig Nobel Prize is known as the ““eccentric little brother’’ of the Nobel Prize. Since its creation in 1991 by the American satirical scientific journal Annals of Improbable Research,The award has been given to research that makes people laugh and think. In addition to fields such as physics, medicine, peace, and literature, this award is held in fields such as physics, medicine, peace, and literature. Research on ““sound” and ““music” has often attracted attention. This is because the science of sound is not just a wave phenomenon. This is because it deeply penetrates into human emotions, society, and physiology. Tracing the history of the Ig Nobel Prize,““Research that deals scientifically with musical phenomena’’ appears repeatedly. There is the science of “measuring the world through sound” andThere is an intersection of art that allows us to “feel the world through sound. ” 2. Sound as an experiment - the moment when science meets music2. 1 2013: Transplantation experiment of mice made to listen to operaIn 2013, a research team led by Niimi Masanori at Teikyo University,He gained attention for an experiment in which he made mice with heart transplants listen to music. This result was awarded the Ig Nobel Medicine Prize. The study compared mice in the following groups:  Group listening to opera (Verdi’s La Traviata) Group that listened to pop music such as Enya Silent control groupAs a result, it was reported that the survival period after heart transplantation was prolonged from an average of 7 days to 27 days in the Opera group (Teikyo Univ. Med. J. , 2013). Music, especially classical structure and rhythm,It is said to have suggested that it may affect immune response and stress tolerance. This research aims to treat music as a medical stimulus. It was highly praised as an idea that transcends the boundaries between art and science. 2. 2 2017: “Vaginal Music Player” ResearchIn 2017, a study by the Institut Marquès in Barcelona, ​​SpainWinner of the Ig Nobel Prize in Medicine. This team developed an intravaginal speaker called “Babypod”,We investigated how fetuses respond to musical stimuli in the womb. According to research, compared to when the sound is played through a speaker from outside the mother’s body,It is said that when the vibrations were applied directly via the Babypod, the fetus showed a response of moving its mouth and tongue. This result suggests ““early development of fetal auditory response. ’’Scientifically supported the possibility that music is related to physiological development. It also attracted a lot of attention in society as an example of visualizing the ““connection between life and sound. ’’ 2. 3 2020: Crocodile calls and resonance - an evolutionary experiment in acousticsIn 2020, research by Takeshi Nishimura and colleagues at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto UniversityReceived the Acoustics Prize. The research team placed crocodiles in a helium-oxygen mixed gas (Heliox) environment. Analyzing the formants (resonant components) of the cry. As a result, we confirmed that the resonance structure also changes as the air density changes. This was an experimental demonstration that voice resonance depends on body size and vocal tract structure. In other words, biological communication called “cries”This made it clear that it is based on physical and acoustic principles. 3. Music itself and the Ig Nobel Prize - the “experimental spirit” of composition, performance, and audience3. 1 The intersection between music’s “structure” and “science”The Ig Nobel Prize stage itself is full of musical humor. At the award ceremony, scientists present their papers in opera style,A presentation format with a “rhythmic structure” of “24 seconds presentation + 7 word summary” will be used. This is the moment when the boundaries between scientific papers and musical performances become blurred. This “structured humor” overlaps with music’s sense of rhythm and order. Music also exists at the intersection of reason and play. 3. 2 Music as a “social experiment using sound”John Cage’s ““4 Minutes 33 Seconds’’ (1952) is known as music that does not make any sound. From an Ig Nobel perspective, it can also be interpreted as an ““auditory/psychological experiment in a silent environment. ’’“Generative music” proposed by Brian Eno,This is an example of transplanting the scientific concepts of chance, algorithms, and time structure into art. Just as science discovers the “laws of the world” through experiments,Musicians also explore the “laws of listening” through experiments. The two share the same spirit of inquiry with different methodologies. 3. 3 Audience as “subject” – between emotion and dataIn recent neuroscience research, fMRI has been used to measure brain activity while listening to music. Efforts are underway to analyze the mechanisms by which pleasure and empathy occur. At the Ig Nobel Peace Prize 2019 (Netherlands/Polish Studies),The award was given to a study that investigated ““angry reactions when hearing unpleasant sounds. ’’How do people react to sound? The question is,It is no longer limited to psychology, but has spread to social and cultural fields. 3. 4 Musician’s “Ig Nobel-like idea” ”Concert that converts brain waves into sound’’ by Sigur Rós from Iceland,Ryuichi Sakamoto’s “acoustic work that converts environmental sounds into data and reconstructs them” isIt is truly a fusion experiment of science and music. This brings to light the image of the musician as a ““scientist who observes the world through sound. ’’ 4. Chronology: Ig Nobel Prize and the history of sound and music researchtimelinetitle Ig Nobel Prize and Sound Research (1991–2024)1991 : The first award ceremony was held at Harvard University. 2005: Research on identifying frogs by their voices wins the Biology Prize2013: Teikyo University, Masanori Niimi  Transplantation experiment of mice that were made to listen to opera 2017 : Institut Marquès  Fetal music response by Babypod 2019: Peace Prize awarded to research on  unpleasant sounds and angry emotions 2020: Kyoto University  Crocodile call resonance research 5. Conclusion: Beyond the boundaries between science and musicBehind the novelty of the Ig Nobel Prize lies the ““purity of the question. ’’This is somewhat similar to the way artists question the world through sound. Music and science - when these two fields intersect,A new “harmony” is born between human emotion and reason.

    "title": "[Column] Expansion of bear damage and impact of sound",
    "body": "1. Introduction: Current status of bear damage and the importance of sound      Text: mmr   Theme: An analysis of the damage caused by bears, which has been increasing in recent years, from the perspective of the impact of noise and behavior control. Examining the role of sound design in the coexistence of humans and bears   In recent years, damage caused by bears has been rapidly increasing in Japan. There are approximately 1,000 cases of crop damage per year, and human damage has approximately doubled in the past 10 years (Ministry of the Environment’s ““Wild Animal Damage Statistics 2024’’). The physical measures taken so far are not sufficient, and sustainable damage control methods are required. What is attracting attention is the ““control of bear behavior through sound. ’’ Bears have a well-developed sense of hearing and are sensitive to human voices, warning sounds, and artificial sounds at specific frequencies. In recent years, an increasing number of demonstration experiments have been conducted by farmers, local governments, and research institutions, expanding the possibilities of sound management based on scientific evidence. 2. Ecology and behavioral characteristics of bears2. 1 Main bear species and distribution Asia black bear (Ursus thibetanus): Found in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, body length 120–150 cm, good at arboreal behavior, omnivorous.  Brown bear (Ursus arctos yesoensis): Hokkaido, 180–250 cm long, large, also consumes fish and small animals. Both species are nocturnal, but daytime activity can also be seen during the spring and fall hunting seasons. 2. 2 Hearing characteristics and response to sound Hearing frequency band: 200Hz–10kHz Can respond to human voice (250–4000Hz) Sensitive to thunder and warning sounds (1000–8000Hz) Low and high frequency sounds in nature also influence behaviorHearing characteristics of bearsgraph TDA[ Frequency Band ] --&gt; B[ Human Voice: 250–4000Hz ]A --&gt; C[ Warning tone: 1000–8000Hz ]A --&gt; D[ Natural sounds: low to high frequencies ]3. Background to the spread of damage3. 1 Population decline and abandonment of satoyamaDue to depopulation, agricultural land in mountainous areas has been left abandoned, and bears’ habitat has moved closer to human settlements. In Hokkaido, the area of ​​abandoned farmland has increased by approximately 30% from 2000 to 2020, which is correlated with an increase in bear encounters (Hokkaido University Wildlife Research Report 2023). 3. 2 Proximity of agricultural crops and forest resourcesWith the increase in orchards and nut forests, there are more cases of bears invading communities. A survey of orchards in Nagano Prefecture found that in some areas, the annual damage rate reached approximately 12%. 3. 3 Impact of climate changeDue to the decrease in snowfall and fluctuations in fruit growth in early spring, they are more likely to visit human settlements during periods of food shortage. 3. 4 Damage statistics by region (2020–2024)      Region   Annual number of damage   Crop damage rate   Number of human damage         Hokkaido   320   10%   5       Nagano Prefecture   150   12%   2       Tohoku   180   8%   3       Kyushu   90   6%   1   4. Effect of sound on bears4. 1 Sound types and reactions   Whistle: Light evasive action     Human Voice: Medium Evasion     Firecracker: Strong Evasion     High-frequency electronic sound (8–10kHz): Experimental avoidance and prevention of habituation are issues  Sound type and bear reaction strengthgraph LRA[whistle] --&gt; B[light evasion]C[Human Voice] --&gt; D[Moderate Evasion]E[Firecracker] --&gt; F[Strong Evasion]G[High frequency electronic sound] --&gt; H[Experimental avoidance]4. 2 Experiment example   Hokkaido Orchard (2015–2018): Invasion rate reduced by 40% due to use of firecrackers     Kyushu electronic sound trial (2019–2021): Short-term avoidance due to the use of high-frequency equipment, long-term habituation occurs     Tohoku AI speaker demonstration (2020–2023): Pre-bear invasion warning success rate 65%  5. Coexistence strategy between human activities and sound5. 1 Sensor-linked warning soundAutomatically generates a sound when a bear approaches. Encourage avoidance actions before damage occurs. 5. 2 Regular patrol soundA sound device that alerts people to the presence of humans reduces their desire to invade. 5. 3 Urban and suburban applicationsIt has already been introduced in Nagano Prefecture and Hokkaido. Safety is ensured by using human voice and electronic sounds during night patrols. 6. The future of sound design6. 1 AI/drone technologySound generation according to behavioral patterns using AI analysis. Cover a wide area with drone patrols. 6. 2 International cases   California, USA: Intrusion prevention using electronic sounds and human voices     BC, Canada: Non-lethal acoustic management reduces crop damage  7. Discussion: Redefining the relationship between humans and bearsDamage control is a matter of coexistence, not pest extermination. Sound countermeasures are non-lethal and effective  Challenges: Habituation, ecosystem impact, cost8. ConclusionThe increasing damage caused by bears is not just a problem for wild animals, but also a mirror of structural changes in human society. Distortions in the environment that we ourselves have created, such as depopulation, climate change, and unbalanced forest use, are driving bears out of the mountains and into villages. In this reality, damage control through sound is extremely suggestive as ““a medium for redesigning the relationship between humans and animals. ’’ Sound is non-lethal and can adjust behavior through fear and learning. In other words, it is control through “resonance” rather than violence, and it can be an ethically sustainable option. The challenge for the future is to evolve it into an ““acoustic landscape design” that incorporates local environmental sounds and the sounds of human life, rather than just a threatening sound. When the behavioral patterns of bears learned by AI are combined with the local sound culture and seasonal rhythms, sound will go beyond a warning and become an ““interface for coexistence. ” Sound policy that combines scientific knowledge and cultural sensitivity is the key to shaping the future of humans and the wild. Communicating with sound, maintaining distance, and restoring harmony to the entire biosphere—this can be called the next era’s “environmental ethics of sound. ” Case studies of damage control using sound (2000–2025)timelinetitle Sound usage examples2002: Hokkaido farmers test whistles and firecrackers2010: Introduction of AI speaker test (Tohoku)2015 : High frequency electronic sound trial (Kyushu)2020: Drone acoustic patrol system introduced (Hokkaido)2025: Expand demonstration experiments in local governments nationwideSound usage flow for bear damage controlflowchart TDA[Farmland/village monitoring] --&gt; B[Sensor detection]B --&gt; C [Acoustic warning transmission]C --&gt; D [Bear escape behavior]D --&gt; E [Damage reduction/safety assurance]References/Materials [Leaflet created by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries “Please be careful of bears”] (https://www. maff. go. jp/j/seisan/tyozyu/higai/tyuuikanki/attach/pdf/index-12. pdf) [“Manual for responding to bear infestations - revised edition - (Ministry of the Environment)”] (http://www. env. go. jp/nature/choju/docs/docs5-4a/index. html) “Guidelines for creating specific wildlife protection and management plans (bears edition) Ministry of the Environment” Ministry of the Environment website “Various information and initiatives regarding bears”"

    "body": "Prologue: Political sensibilities born from the roar of metalText: mmr｜Theme: A politician who loves heavy metal—Sanae Takaichi. How has her musical sensibility given a steely resonance to her words, policies, and ideas? Sanae Takaichi is often described as a ““conservative,” ““strong-minded,” and ““a fighting woman. ” However, at its root lies the impact of the heavy metal music he heard in his youth. Metal is a music of passion and construction, an art that confines passion within order. Her school band played songs by Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, and she also likes to listen to bands like Judas Priest, and these sensibilities form the ““acoustic skeleton” of her political language and cultural outlook. Chapter 1: Metal, a spiritual deviceMetal is an art of passion, but also an art of order and construction. His style of controlling strong emotions through mathematical constructs is consistent with Takaichi’s political speaking style.       Metal structure   Takaichi political structure         Roar (passion/anger)   Passion for national and cultural defense       Riff (repetition)   Repetitive syntax of policy slogans       Solo (development)   Improvisational emphasis during speech       Break (silence)   Controlling pauses and breathing   Just as metal is “an art that turns chaos into order,” Takaichi’s speech resonates as music of words that syntaxizes passion. Chapter 2: Building a Voice——The Politics of Metallic VoiceFor politicians, their ““voice”’ is an instrument that embodies their ideas. Takaichi”s vocalization is particularly low and stable among female politicians. Acoustically, it is based on the mid-low range (approximately 170-180Hz), with little pitch fluctuation, reminiscent of the “steel control” in metal vocals.  ”Voice is the art of making your emotions resonate without letting them run wild. ” As symbolized by these words, she lives politics as an ““iron structure. ” Chapter 3: Metal worldview and national viewMetal deals with extreme themes such as mythology, war, religion, and death. It is a theme that resonates with the fundamental issues of human society, such as ““national defense,” ““cultural defense,” and ““freedom of expression’’ in real politics. Mr. Takaichi’s emphasis on ““cultural independence,” ““technological sovereignty,” and ““national independence” sounds like an ““ordered rebellion” played by metal. Her view of the nation is not just a conservative defense, but a constructive ideology that aims to establish a spiritual identity. Chapter 4: Metal and conservative thought—Passion in orderAt first glance, conservative ideology and metal seem to be contradictory. However, the common points between the two are ““order to destroy order” and ““aesthetics in strength. ” Like Judas Priest, music that confines explosive passion within an orderly rhythm. This is exactly like Mr. Takaichi’s political stance. Although the logical structure is cold, there is an intense “combustion” behind it. “In cold construction lies true heat. ” This phrase applies to both metal and politics. Through the character Sanae Takaichi, we can reconsider “politics that lives like sound. ” Chapter 5: Cultural Policy and Metal EthicsAs Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, Mr. Takaichi was in charge of broadcasting, communications, and copyright policy for a long time. Consistent among them was the awareness of ““protecting the rights of creators” and ““cultural sovereignty. ” In the metal world, there is a DIY spirit of protecting one’s own sound without relying on labels. Her policy was also based on the philosophy that the nation should have its own cultural infrastructure. Even in the music industry, this perspective of “independence and protection” is extremely modern in the era of distribution, copyright, and AI generation. Chapter 6: Women and Metal——Elegance of IronFemale vocalists in metal have used their voices as weapons to open up new worldviews (for example, Arch Enemy’s Angela Gossow). Takaichi has also attracted attention as a woman who uses her voice strategically in politics. Her “strength” is not an attack, but one of calm control. It can be said that he is a politician who embodies the “elegance of steel” in metal. In that sense, Sanae Takaichi may be the ““lead vocalist of the band Koku. ’’ Chapter 7: Politics as Metal StructureThe structure of her speech resembles the structure of a metal song. flowchart TDA[ Intro: Quiet presentation of logic ]B[ Riff: Repetition of core theme ]C[ Solo: Passionate Emphasis ]D[ Break: A moment of silence/modulation ]E[ Outro: Consequences to Order ]A --&gt; B --&gt; C --&gt; D --&gt; EWithin this structure, Mr. Takaichi plays with ““intellect that controls passion. ’’ Final Chapter: Towards politics that is not afraid of noiseJust as metal has evolved by accepting noise, mature politics also becomes stronger when it embraces “unusual sounds. ” The existence of Sanae Takaichi symbolizes the “acceptance of noise” in Japanese politics. The noise doesn’t sound like chaos, but creative distortion.  ”New sounds can only be born from silence. ’’ This phrase applies to both metal and politics. Through the character Sanae Takaichi, we can reconsider “politics that lives like sound. ” Chronology: Sanae Takaichi and the history of metal resonance (1980–2025)  graph TDA1980[ 1980: Exposure to loudness and Judas Priest ] --&gt; A1983[ 1983: Graduated from the Department of Business Administration, Faculty of Business Administration, Kobe University ]A1983 --&gt; A1984[ 1984: Joined Matsushita School of Government and Economics as a fifth-year student ]A1984 --&gt; A1992[ 1992: First elected (independent) ]A1992 --&gt; A1993[ 1993: Joined the Liberal Democratic Party via the Liberal Party and Shinshin Party ]A1993 --&gt; A2002[ 2002: Appointed Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, promotes broadcasting and copyright policy ]A2002 --&gt; A2014[ 2014: Leading the discussion on freedom of expression and broadcasting ethics ]A2014 --&gt; A2021[ 2021: Liberal Democratic Party presidential election calls for 'defense of culture and support for creation' ]A2021 --&gt; A2025[ 2025: Considering policy to integrate culture and technology ]Illustration: Sanae Takaichi’s “metal structure” correlation diagram  flowchart LRA[ Metal Aesthetics (Hard, Constructed, Rebellious) ]B[ Voice Construction (Metallic Voice) ]C[ Cultural policy (creators' rights and freedom of expression) ]D[ View of the nation (order and independence) ]E[ Femininity (elegance of steel) ]A --&gt; B --&gt; C --&gt; D --&gt; EReferences/Citations Sanae Takaichi “Toward a Beautiful, Strong, and Growing Country” (PHP Institute, 2014)Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Judas Priest Recommended Albums      Band   Album   Year of release   Features and highlights         Black Sabbath   Black Sabbath   1970   A work that is said to be the birth of the world’s first heavy metal.

    "title": "[Column] \"10 seconds of sound\" that changed my life - Sound spark in my memory",
    "body": "Prologue: When sound changes “life”Text: mmr｜Theme: Fragments of “10 seconds” that keep ringing in my memory When you look back on your life, there are moments when just a few seconds of sound changed your thoughts, actions, and the rest of your life. It could be the intro to a song, some noise from the radio, a riff you happened to hear at a club, or a melody someone hummed on a street corner at night. In this column, I will use my own experience with ““10 seconds of sound” as a starting point to explore how sound is connected to memories, shapes culture, and influences our ““way of life. ” Chapter 1: The moment that 10 seconds rang - the origin of personal experience10 seconds of “Health and Efficiency”. Those 10 seconds of the loop completely rewrote my auditory world. At that time, I only listened to music as an emotional expression with lyrics. But that rhythmic repetition taught me the pleasure of ““structure over meaning’’. It was at that moment that I realized that sound could be a ““space” rather than a ““message”. Chapter 2: 10 Second Memory Device - Sound and NeuroscienceWhy do “short fragments of sound” remain deeply memorable?From a neuroscientific perspective, sound reaches the amygdala (emotional center) faster than vision. The speed at which it triggers an emotional response in just 0. 2 seconds creates the ““acuteness of sonic memory. ’’ Additionally, a length of 10 seconds is consistent with the limits of human working memory. In other words, it is the smallest unit that can consciously retain ““the sound you are currently listening to. ’’Within that short span of time, we instantly judge emotions such as pleasure, displeasure, and nostalgia. flowchart TDT[ Sound and memory process (auditory → emotion → memory) ]T --&gt; AA[ Sound input (10 seconds fragment) ]B[ Emotional response in the amygdala ]C[ Long-term memory formation in the hippocampus ]D[ Contextualization (memory of the  situation  in which the sound was played) ]E[ Emotions are reconstructed during playback ]A --&gt; B --&gt; C --&gt; D --&gt; EChapter 3: Cultural “10 seconds” – sounds that create collective memoryNot only individuals but also society forms memories based on ““10 seconds of sound’’. For example, the Olympic fanfare, the intro to a Star Wars movie, or the sound of a smartphone notification. These subtle sounds evoke a common emotional response across generations and borders. It’s no coincidence that TikTok and YouTube Shorts have centered around 10-15 second sound loops since the 2000s. The algorithm selects the ““sound that stimulates emotions the fastest,’’ which has become a cultural conditioned reflex. Chapter 4: “Fragments” echoing in the darkness of the club – the structure of collective tranceAt clubs and festivals, the music seems to go on for a long time, but in reality it is made up of a series of ““several seconds’’. DJs unconsciously reorganize the space every 10 seconds. Phrase changes, bass omissions, snare repetitions——Each moment recalibrates the breathing and energy of the floor. To use the ““flow theory’’ proposed by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,This 10-second sonic immersion is what modern-day meditation is all about. As people dance, they dissolve themselves in the waves of sound. Chapter 5: “10 seconds” in the digital age – Skip culture and memory fragmentationIn the streaming era, we decide whether to listen to a song or skip it within the first 10 seconds of a song. This is not just a habit, but a change in the memory structure itself. In the old album culture, each song was a story, but today’s music consumption is a series of fragments. Despite this, people are still searching for “sounds that move their hearts. ”Rather, they are being tested on their sensitivity to finding just 10 seconds of light in a sea of ​​choices. Chapter 6: Why do we never forget that sound?A 10-second sound is tied to the physical sensation of that moment and is memorized. The smell of rain, the light in the room, the rhythm of your heartbeat. Therefore, even if time passes, just listening to the sound brings back the ““entire experience’’ of the past. Music is a ““media that transcends time. ’’And that power is activated not in 10 minutes or 10 hours, but in just 10 seconds. Final Chapter: Every sound is a fragment of lifeA 10 second sound can decide a person’s life. The accumulation of these fragments forms our memories and culture. Music is not a long symphony, but a collection of countless small “sound sparks. ”The sound of me being shot in the chest at that moment. These are the “Our 10 Seconds” that will continue to resonate throughout the ages. "

    "body": "“Introduction — What is modular?”      Text: mmr   Theme: Spiritual history of West Coast modular synths. How Don Buchler and Serge Tocheny”s ideas have been carried over into today”s sound design   Early 1970s, America’s West Coast. There were people who left their university’s electronic music studio and tried to take a device for designing sound back into their personal creative spaces. Their names are Don Buchla and Serge Tcherepnin. Buchla and Serge are often talked about as the so-called “progenitors of modular synths,” but they actually stand out in that they sought to create philosophical tools rather than commercial instruments. Their design philosophy contained an “anti-normative” sonic perspective that is common to today’s Eurorack, Max/MSP, and even AI-based generated music. 1. Don Buchler: Poetics of Electronic Sound1-1. From San Francisco Tape Music CenterAt San Francisco’s Tape Music Center in the early 1960s, artists like Morton Subotnick and Pauline Oliveros were exploring new relationships between experimental music and technology. What they were looking for was ““an instrument that was not an extension of the piano or guitar. ’’ The Buchla Series 100 (1963–1966) appeared in response to Subotnick’s request. Traditional musical operability was intentionally avoided, such as the acoustic circuit configuration using knobs and patch cables, and the touch plate keyboard (actually a voltage input device without a scale).  “No black and white keys. ” — Don Buchla 1-2. Buchla’s philosophy: Performative ElectronicsBuchla designed musical instruments as ““an ecosystem in which control and generation coexist. ’’Sound does not come directly from the performer’s body, but is generated by the abstract behavior of voltage changes. Therefore, the performance becomes an improvisational “act” and the sound is fluid. flowchart LRsubgraph Buchla_System[ Buchla System 100/200 Conceptual Structure ]direction LRCV[ Voltage Source(Control voltage) ] --&gt; MOD[ Modulation Bus(Modulation path) ]MOD --&gt; OSC[ Complex Oscillator ]OSC --&gt; LPG[ Low Pass Gate(tone/volume linked) ]LPG --&gt; OUT[ Audio Out ]endstyle Buchla_System fill:#f0f8ff,stroke:#003366,stroke-width:1px;This structure symbolizes Buchla’s worldview of “catalyzing sound rather than manipulating it. ”The Low Pass Gate (an element that controls both volume and timbre) later became a standard philosophical device in Eurorack culture. 2. Serge Tochenin: democratized module2-1. Birth of “The People”s Synthesizer”In the late 1970s, young musician Serge Tochenin was impressed by Don Buchla’s design philosophy, and while studying electronic music at UCLA, he envisioned a ““Buchla-like device that more people could have access to. ’’That is Serge Modular Music System (1974–). While Buchler created custom machines for artists, Serge is rooted in DIY culture and the university community, with an ethos of ““open up the schematics so anyone can build them’’. This open source attitude was a conceptual revolution that preceded the later spread of Eurorack. 2-2. Serge’s philosophy: Patch ProgrammabilitySerge’s fundamental philosophy is “One module, many functions”. In other words, the idea is that a single circuit can have an infinite number of operating modes depending on how it is connected. For example, the Dual Universal Slope Generator (commonly known as “DSG”)  envelope-LFO trigger delay clock divider Chaos moduleThe functionality changes depending on the patch configuration. This philosophy continues directly into today”s Max/MSP patching, Reaktor Blocks, and Eurorack”s Make Noise “Maths. ” 3.

Impact on modular cultureBuchler and Sarge’s philosophy redefined sound itself as a “social act. ”In other words, he shifted his focus from the ““instrument” to the ““environment” and ““interface. ’’ The modular “infinite combinations” of Eurorack are not simply the freedom of parts, but the very reconfiguration of meaning. Buchla”s ““physicality” and Serge”s ““structurality” have merged, and today’s electronic music is becoming more and more ““decentric. ’’ timelinetitle Buchla / Serge: Evolution of Modular Thinking1963 : Buchla Series 100 development1969 : Buchla 200 series1974 : Serge Modular initial version1980 : Serge Dual Slope Generator1990 : Buchla 400 / MIDI experiment2004 : Eurorack boom2020 : Buchla USA / Serge re-evaluation6. Connecting to the Modern Age: Between Algorithms and the BodyThe Buchla/Serge spirit is alive and well in Max/MSP, VCV Rack, and even AI-generated music tools. It is not just a “combination of modules,” but an artistic frame that connects time, space, the body, and probability. Modular synths are not just “tools” for creating sounds;It is a medium that generates “events” that occur between sounds and people. Buchla and Serge’s design philosophy continues to be the germ of that media philosophy. Conclusion — Poetics of “Control Voltage”Don Buchler is said to have said this before his death.  “Voltage is not a number — it”s a gesture. ” Sarge also says.  “Every patch is a composition. ” For them, voltage is not just a signal;It was ““a poetic language that connects the human will and machines. ’‘ Even now in 2025, we continue to listen to the poetry of that voltage.

    "title": "[Column] Plastikman | Richie Hawtin - The depths of minimalism and the spiritual history of techno",
    "body": "Prologue: Self as a “space” of soundText: mmr｜Theme: Thoughts on how Plastikman, who inherited the spirit of the second generation of Detroit techno, stripped down the sound to the utmost limit and sublimated it into an art that allows you to hear the “reverberation” of rhythm itself. Richie Hawtin has been redefining “techno” since the early 1990s, not just as dance music, but as a “sound meditation device. ” His works under the name Plastikman, particularly ““Sheet One” (1993) and ““Consumed” (1998), are experiments in visualizing the internal space of the human body with electronic sound, and the sound, which resembles cold liquid, is also called ““abstract sculpture of sound. ’’ Chapter 1: Echoes of Detroit, Solitude of WindsorRichie Hawtin was born in Banbury, England in 1970 and moved to Windsor, Canada as a child. From this city across the Detroit River, he could see the early days of Detroit techno at the underground clubs Music Institute and The Shelter. Hawtin was influenced by the spirit that resides in the mechanical rhythms of Juan Atkins and Derrick May, and reconstructed it from a perspective of calm structural beauty. There is always a paradox in his music: heat through distance. Cities and suburbs, black and white culture, emotion and geometry. Plastikman was ““music in the middle area’’ that was formed in between. Chapter 2: The Birth of Plastikman - Acid Remnants and Techno IntrospectionIn 1993, “Sheet One” was released. The traditional TB-303 sound of acid house has been bleached to the limit, creating an acoustic space that sounds like heartbeat and nerve signals. Rather, the silence that drifts between the sounds can be heard as the main character. Then, in 1994, the album [ ”Musik”’] was released from the label NovaMute (https://monumental-movement. jp/Plastikman-Musik). This is Richie Hawtin”s third studio album and second under his Plastikman name.  “Plastikman is a project that uses sound to visualize my own insides. ”— Richie Hawtin The live shows around this time had red strobe lights flashing momentarily in the almost pitch-black venue, symbolizing the materialization of sound. Rather than dancing, the audience felt as if they were ““sinking’’ into the sound. Plastikman – MusikAn album released by Richie Hawtin under the alias Plastikman on the NovaMute label in 1994. This is Richie Hawtin’s third studio album and second under his Plastikman name. Tracklist1. Konception2. Plastique3. Kriket4. Fuk5. Outbak6. Ethnik7. Plasmatik8. Goo9. Marbles10. LasttrakPurchase on Mercari YoutubeChapter 3: “Consumed” – The aesthetics of “silence”1998’s Consumed is an outlier in the history of techno. The BPM is slow and the rhythm is no longer a drum, but a low frequency sound like breathing. This work, which seems to float in a zero-gravity space, inherits the lineage of Brian Eno’s ambient music, but also opens up the realm of ““inner sculpture using electronic sounds. ’’ With this work, Hawtin becomes the first artist to equate “minimalism” with “nihility. ” Plastikman’s minimalism was not an omission, but a strategy of silence that highlighted the contours of existence. Chapter 4: Technology and the Body - Rebuilding the LIVE ConceptHawtin also pioneered the fusion of technology and performance. In the 2000s, he redefined DJ play with the “DE9” series, establishing the ““prototype of digital DJ’’ that used Ableton Live and Traktor to reconstruct tracks in real time. On his stage, an environment was constructed in which MacBook, MIDI controller, lighting and video were completely synchronized, presenting a new concept of  ”live = breathing data’‘. Chapter 5: Playing Plastikman with “EX” ”EX”’, which was unveiled at London”s Tate Modern in 2014, was a work that transferred Plastikman’s aesthetics to a museum space. The stage is shrouded in darkness, and Houtin stands as if imprisoned in a glowing cage. The audience shares the experience of ““observing the structure of sound” rather than ““watching a DJ. ”  “Plastikman remains the music of an inward journey. ” His minimalism evolved, completely dissolving the boundaries between music and art, clubs and installations. Chapter 6: Influence and Inheritance - The Genes of Modern MinimalismPlastikman”s genes permeate Villalobos, Donato Dozzy, Cio D”Or, and the modern modular scene. ““Pleasure of structure,” ““introspection of sound,” and ““temporization of space’’ – these elements now form the basis of techno. In particular, “Consumed in Key” (2022, collaboration: Chilly Gonzales) broke new ground as a dialogue between piano and minimalism. It was the moment when Plastikman once again stroked the “line between humanity and inorganicity. ” Chapter 7: Philosophical Addendum – The Meaning of “Plastic”Plastikman’s “Plastic” is not just “plastic”. It means plasticity – the flexibility of existence that maintains its essence while changing form. Plastikman’s true philosophy is his continued transformation of music, the body, identity, and the very concept of techno.  Minimalism is not about scarcity, but about space for change. Chapter 8: DE9 Series - Digital DJ Revolution1. Introducing DE9In 2001, Plastikman released DE9: Closer to the Edit. Traditional DJ mixes rely on track order and fades, but here Hawtin uses waveform-level editing and restructuring. By splitting each track into tiny samples and rearranging the minimal pulses, we created a completely new timeline of dance music. 2. Technological innovation Real-time processing using Ableton Live/Traktor Instant reflection of effect operations via MIDI control The concept of “editing = playing” in sample unitsAs a result, the DJ’s physical manipulation has changed to the act of playing acoustic material rather than playing the music itself. 3. Musical significanceThe DE9 series is not just a mix CD, but also functions as a recording of a live performance = new song.  Closer to the Edit (2001): Cold mechanical precision “DE9: Transitions” (2005): Visualization of effect processing “DE9: Closer to the Edit 2. 0 / Live” (2019): Fusion of modular and digital DE9 is a revolutionary series that fundamentally changed the question “What is a DJ mix?” in music history. Chapter 9: Minus Label History - Minimalist Testing Ground1. Established MinusIn 1998, Plastikman founded his own label, Minus. The goal was “a space where you can experiment with sounds stripped down to the limit”. Minus is characterized by respecting the individuality of the artist while maintaining a sense of unity in the philosophical direction of music. 2. Representative works and artists Richie Hawtin (also known as Plastikman) Villalobos-Magda GaiserMinus was more than just a distribution platform, it functioned as a place to embody the idea of ​​minimal techno. 3. Label influence A fusion of live sets and releases: digitally reconstructable sound sources Aesthetics of sound blank space: Experimenting with “how to use white space” International influence: Direct influence on club scenes in Berlin, Germany and Tokyo Minus is an ““acoustic laboratory”’ to pass on Plastikman”s musical philosophy to the next generation.

This was not a dismantling of club music, but a reconstruction of the rhythm that resonates inside the body, and an exploration of the fundamental question of music: ““What does it mean to listen?’’ Today, Richie Hawtin continues to turn the knobs in silence, saying few words. This is because he knows better than anyone that just one rotation can change the boundary between sound and silence.

    "title": "[Column] Aphex Twin's early days and present day -- beyond the critical point of electronic music",
    "body": "“When music stopped imitating emotions, Aphex Twin appeared. ”Text: mmr｜Theme: Comparing Aphex Twin’s early works with their current achievements, and critically interpreting the changes in their acoustic structure, philosophy, and technology. In the early 1990s, Richard D. James (Aphex Twin) emerged as someone who completely turned the existing grammar of genres like techno and ambient on its head. His early works are sound experiments in which mechanical dreams and human illusions intertwine, and his current sound lies between an artificial intelligence structure and a return to nostalgia. Below, we will compare and examine these “changes” and “unchanges” from the four axes of work, technology, aesthetics, and ideology. I. The world of early Aphex Twin: electronic poetics and analog violence1. 1 “Selected Ambient Works” - Introspective electronic dreams1992’s Selected Ambient Works 85–92 was a turning point in the history of electronic music. The monotonous rhythm of a sequencer and the soft fluctuations of an analog synth. What you can hear inside is ““human breathing’’ on the other side of the electrons. Rather than ““composing” sounds, Richard composed ““environments. ”A strange sound image that is ambient yet has the intensity of a club. It was an extension of Brian Eno, but with a more personal and destructive emotion.  “For me, ambient is ‘memories that reverberate in the air. ’” (Aphex Twin, 1993) 1. 2 The era of “Classics” and “Analogue Bubblebath”In the early EPs, the physical constraints of the hardware shaped the very character of the sound. Manual errors such as the Roland TB-303, SH-101, and Akai S950 defined his aesthetic. Glitches (atomization of noise) and irregular tempo changes areIt later became the origin of a movement called “IDM (Intelligent Dance Music)”. Supplementary Chapter: Early Aphex Twin’s “Noise Body”His early music was also an experiment in pushing the “physicality of sound” to its limits. The internal noise of the machine becomes the rhythm, and the errors become the building blocks. It is pre-digital “analog violence” and an attempt to transform error into the aesthetics of construction. II. Mid-term transformation: Rhythm as sound sculpture2. 1 “Richard D. James Album” – Reincarnation under a personal nameWith 1996’s “Richard D. James Album,” Aphex Twin clearly defined his “authorship. ”What you hear here is a sonic sculpture that fragments and reconstructs breakbeats to the extreme. In “The World of a Quarter Beat,” the drums bounce, the strings are cut, and the voices become particles. The sophistication is as if they were composing music at the DNA level. It’s amazing that they created this complexity in a pre-DAW environment. 2. 2 “Come to Daddy” “Windowlicker” ─ Media and NightmareFrom 1997 to 1999, Aphex Twin combined music with “visual horror. ”The PV group created in collaboration with Chris Cunningham converted the instability of electronic sound into the amorphousness of images. Around the time MTV featured him as the “weirdest genius”He was already sensing that his music was in danger of becoming incorporated into popular culture. Supplementary Chapter: Aphex Twin as IronyAphex Twin’s activities since the middle of their career have always been a meta-critique of the music industry. His smiling face (logo) is a satire on the “artist myth”,The puzzling nature of song titles asserts the ““right of sound to defy meaning. ’’ III. Silence and Resurrection—Digital maturity after “Syro”3. 1 “Syro” (2014): Completion of the acoustic archiveHis first album in 13 years, “Syro,” is a fusion of analog return and digital editing. All songs have detailed credits for the equipment used,Aphex Twin suggests that “every sound has a technical history. ” What is important here is that the focus is on the ““feel of the data” rather than ““emotions. ”In other words, music is transforming into “the body as information. ” 3. 2 “Collapse EP” (2018): Emergence of AI composition structureCollapse EP is Aphex Twin’s experiment in embedding emotion into algorithmic structures. Complex time signatures, intermittent rhythms, and three-dimensional spatial processing. Sound particles self-deploy like AI’s thoughts, forming an inhuman “flow. ” Supplementary chapter: Relationship between modern Aphex Twin and AIAphex Twin takes AI composition not just as a technological innovation;It is treated as a “device that extends human perception”. His recent work can be described as an attempt to make artificial intelligence learn about “human errors. ”In other words, his music is a testing ground for post-AI humanism. IV. Comparison between the early days and the present: Three-layered structure of technology, ideology, and emotion      Item   Early (1990–1995)   Current (2014–2025)         Technology   Mainly analog equipment and samplers   Modular + digital algorithms       Texture of sound   Organic, accidental, material   Geometric, informational, transparent       Aesthetics   Coexistence of noise and rhythm   Symbiosis of data and emotion       Subject of expression   Individual’s inner world/body   Boundary between humans and machines       Social context   Rave ~ the dawn of IDM   The maturation of AI/algorithm culture   Supplementary chapter: Unchanging “feeling of foreign body”The core of Aphex Twin lies in ““remaining foreign’’ even as times change. Even when music becomes trendy, his sound always leaves a “margin”. It is in that blank space that there is room for listeners to project their own emotions. V. Critical Thoughts: What is music after Aphex Twin?After Aphex Twin, electronic music is no longer just a “genre. ”Artists influenced by him include Burial, Oneohtrix Point Never, Autechre, Arca, etc. All of these questions reconsider the “meaning generation” of sound itself.  “In an era where music is converted into data, Aphex Twin has become a ““sculptor of perception. ’’ Supplementary chapter: Suggestions for the future of musicWe live in an era where AI creates music and Spotify categorizes your mood. In such a situation, the sound of Aphex Twin is trying to recover the human noise hidden in the data. His current music is no longer an act of ““listening,” but rather a ““philosophy of sound that exists. ” VI. Chronology: Aphex Twin acoustic evolution trajectorytimelinetitle Aphex Twin Chronology of acoustic evolution (1985–2025)1985: Started experimenting with cassettes (Cornwall)1991 : Established Rephlex and announced the Analogue Bubblebath series1992 :  Selected Ambient Works 85–92  released1995: Abstracting ambient with  . . . Volume II 1996: Cellularization of rhythm in  Richard D.

Conclusion: Aphex Twin, a “sound conscious body”Aphex Twin’s music is not just a collection of electronic sounds. It is an experiment to visualize the “metastructure of listening”. It is also a philosophical event where human emotions and machine perception meet. In his early works, “electronization of emotions” was carried out,Nowadays, the trend has reversed to the ““emotionalization of electronics’’. His journey may foretell a future in which music itself becomes conscious. Reference materials/recommended discography   Selected Ambient Works 85–92 (1992, R&amp;S)     Richard D.

    "title": "[Column] Why do people listen to music when they are sad? Sound as empathy, memory, and neural tuning",
    "body": "Prologue: Melody in TearsText: mmr｜Theme: Exploring the relationship between sadness and music from the perspectives of psychology, neuroscience, and cultural history Why do people turn to music when they are sad?The silence is often broken by a single note on the piano or a haunting singing voice. This act is both intuitive and deeply scientific. Music is a ““resonator’’ of emotions and the only experience that can be shared in solitude. In this paper, while crossing the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and cultural history,We will explore the question, “Why do people listen to music when they are sad?” Chapter 1: Sadness and the Brain - Neural Resonance StructureAccording to modern neuroscience, sadness is strongly associated with activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the brain. By listening to music, these areas undergo “emotional restructuring” andEncourages the process of objectively viewing one’s own emotions. Music is not just an external stimulus, but a ““mirror of nerves. ’’When you listen to a sad melody, “sad neurons” resonate in your brain,The feel-good chemical dopamine is secreted there. This contradictory reaction—”pleasure in sadness”—is whatThis is one of the biggest reasons why people seek out sad music. Chapter 2: Music as a device of empathyAccording to psychologist Catherine Mercier,““Music is a mimicking device for empathy. ’’When listeners listen to sad music, they “identify” with the emotions of the composer and singer, andFeeling the presence of others in loneliness. This is a universal behavior from a cultural anthropological perspective. Funerals, requiems, prayers, labor songs: Every culture has sounds that share sadness. Music of sadness is an act that has a community healing structure. Chapter 3: Melody as a memory deviceMusic you listen to when you’re sad often plays back memories from the past. Psychologically, this is a phenomenon called “musical recall. ”A certain melody evokes past scenes, smells, and the feel of a season. People organize their memories during times of sadness. Music is an “editing tool” for that purpose. It functions as a temporal medium that connects memories and emotions.  “Music is the only art that visualizes time”— Romain Rolland Chapter 4: “Sounds of sadness” from a cultural historical perspectiveMusic of sadness has existed in different forms with each era. The chronology below shows the typical flow. timelinetitle Cultural history of sadness and music (B. C. to modern times)500 BC: Ancient Greek  Threnos —a ritual of collective mourning. 1600: Baroque opera —  Lamento , a style that turns sadness into art1820: Romantic music — inner expression symbolized by Chopin's  Funeral March 1940 : Blues/Gospel — turning social pain into sound1970: Singer-songwriter culture — personal grief becomes poetry1990: Grunge/Alternative — an aesthetic that screams loneliness2020 : Lo-fi hiphop/emo rap — a new requiem for the age of digital lonelinessLooking at this trend, we can see that music of sadness has always existed as a mirror of society. The pain of an individual is transformed into the voice of the times. Chapter 5: “Aesthetics of Sadness” in Japanese CultureIn Japan, there has been a concept called ““mono aware’’ since ancient times. This is an idea that does not deny sadness, but rather affirms it as a ““beautiful emotion. ’’From gagaku’s ““Ettenraku’’ to the narration of biwa priests, and even enka,Music in Japanese culture consistently contains a sense of sadness. Listening to sad music has functioned as an emotional cleansing ritual. Crying is not a sign of weakness, but an act of emotional social reconnection. Chapter 6: “Sharing Grief” in the Digital AgeIn Spotify and YouTube playlists,It is flooded with tags such as “Sad Songs,” “Rainy Mood,” and “Breakup Song. ”The algorithm even learns your tendency to feel sad,We propose the optimal “tears BGM”. This phenomenon can also be called Platformization of personal feelings. In an anonymous space, people exchange ““quiet empathy’’ through sound. graph LRA[feelings of sadness] --&gt; B[music selection behavior]B --&gt; C[Algorithm recommendation]C --&gt; D[Share playlist]D --&gt; E [Circle of empathy/approval]Sadness is no longer closed,It has become a digital emotion that resonates through the network. Chapter 7: The intersection of science and art - reproduction through soundSince the 2020s, “music therapy” has been reevaluated in the field of clinical psychology. Music has been scientifically proven to have an impact on emotional recovery during the treatment of patients with depression.    Relaxation effect due to increase in alpha waves     Heart rate variability (HRV) stability     Externalization of emotions that are difficult to verbalize  Music is a “reset button for the mind” and at the same time,It is also a “translator” of emotions. Final chapter: Kindness in the soundListening to music when people are sadIt’s not to escape your emotions, but to regain yourself. Shedding tears in the melody,Regain your breathing in the rhythm,Achieving “reconnection with the world” beyond words. Music is a medium that turns sadness into love.

    "title": "[Column] How to perceive the charm of destructive artists - Between creation and destruction -",
    "body": "Prologue: A heart drawn to tragedyText: mmr｜Theme: Genius and destruction, creation and self-destruction. From Kurt Cobain to Amy Winehouse to Yukio Mishima. Explore why people are attracted to destructive artists from the perspectives of psychology, cultural history, and brain science. Why are we so captivated by the image of an artist heading toward destruction?Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, Amy Winehouse, and Yukio Mishima. Their lives came to an untimely end, with their works shining like crystals of pain, conflict, and loneliness. When we come into contact with their music and literature, we are exposed to a ““human cry” that goes beyond mere ““works. ”It is also a modern myth that represents the anxiety, emptiness, and desire for recognition that everyone has. Chapter 1: Genealogy of destructive artistsA destructive artist is one who turns the urge for self-destruction into a driving force for creation. Their history began with the birth of modern art. In 19th century Romanticism, poets and painters considered “madness” to be a symbol of creativity. It extolled the nobility of the soul that cannot fit into society. Byron, Rimbaud, Van Gogh. This lineage has been passed down to musicians and film directors since the 20th century. They turned “life itself” into art. The moment the work and life match, the audience becomes intoxicated by the truth. Chapter 2: Psychological Analysis - Mechanisms of Creativity and Self-DestructionPsychologist Nancy Andreasen has discovered that many forms of creative genius show a link to “bipolar disorder. ”The overwhelming concentration and passion that are born during the height of creativity,The period of depression that follows. It is this amplitude that gives birth to original expression. On the other hand, the urge to self-destruct can be said to be an ““extreme expression of the desire for approval. ’’The pain of not being understood by society transforms into “work” the proof of one’s existence. The culmination of this is the ““aesthetics of death,’’ a view of art that is completed with destruction. Chapter 3: Popular culture and “death production”After Kurt Cobain’s death, his suicide note was quoted all over the world. Jim Morrison’s grave remains a place of pilgrimage. The public “consumes” the destruction and receives the tragedy as a “story. ” The media accelerated that structure. Scandals, addiction, death from overwork, burnout…In the ““empathy economy’’ of the social media era, pain has become the emotion most easily spread. People see their own shadows in the “crumbling genius. ” Chapter 4: Neuroscientific perspective - Pleasure of “sublime” and “danger”The human brain has a structure that finds ““pleasure’’ in fear and sadness. At the moment when the amygdala and nucleus accumbens are activated at the same time, we feel the beauty of tragedy. It is similar to the ““unresolved dissonance’’ in music. When the brain finds order in danger, it releases dopamine. In other words, the story of a destructive artist is a device that creates a ““pleasant tension’’ on the nervous system. Chapter 5: “Self-destruction and approval” in the SNS eraIn today’s world, anyone can become a small-scale ““disastrous artist. ’’The structure of transmitting emotions and gaining sympathy through SNS blurs the line between creation and self-revelation. When excessive self-expression eats away at the soul, the boundaries between artists and followers collapse. In that sense, Kurt Cobain’s “Lonely Cry”It can be said that he was anticipating the 21st century structure associated with posting on Instagram and TikTok. Chapter 6: Ethics and Empathy – Are we “consumers” or “accomplices”?Admiring tragedy often carries a structure of perpetration. Fans unconsciously “glorify” the artist’s pain,Even after death, the suffering is “deified. ” However, empathy is supposed to mean “understanding their pain and wishing for their recovery. ”Rather than becoming intoxicated by destruction, what can we learn from it and how can we heal?This is the new ethics for accepting art in the 21st century. Final Chapter: Toward the Art of SurvivalCreation and destruction are always two sides of the same coin. However, the era of art that can only be completed by death is coming to an end. Now that AI is in charge of creation and communities are expanding where people can share their personal struggles,There is no need to worship “ruin” as a myth.

    "title": "[Column] The multilayered structure of Tokyo sound - the sound culture of Shinjuku, Shibuya, Shimokitazawa, and Akihabara",
    "body": "Prologue: Strata of sounds made by citiesText: mmr｜Theme: Jazz in Shinjuku, club culture in Shibuya, indie music in Shimokitazawa, electronic music in Akihabara. Tracing the history and present of the multi-layered sounds produced in Tokyo. The city of Tokyo has continued to change its contours through sound. The sounds of trains, crowds, the hum of neon signs, street guitars, and underground beats. Each sound coexists, composing different eras and different layers. In this column, we will focus on four areas in Tokyo where musical cultures have intersected in particular: Shinjuku, Shibuya, Shimokitazawa, and Akihabara, and trace the changes in sound from the postwar period to the present day. It is not just a piece of local history, but a record of the city’s “soundscape,” a mirror image of society mediated by music. Chapter 1: Shinjuku - Jazz City of Chaos and Freedom1. Shinjuku Pit In and Postwar Jazz NightIn the late 1960s, young people emerging from the post-war chaos gathered in the back alleys of Shinjuku. Many jazz cafes such as Pit Inn, DUG, and J were born, and sound became a symbol of freedom. The night when the saxophone rang out was also the political season, and jazz sounded simultaneously the anger and liberation of the city. 2. Intersection of rock and undergroundAround the time when Shuji Terayama and Juro Kara were opening up the underground of Shinjuku through theater,Brain Police and RC Succession responded with rock. The live house ““LOFT’’ opened in 1976, establishing Shinjuku as a free zone for music. Chapter 2: Shibuya - Between the club and the street1. The illusion of Shibuya-keiIn the 1990s, Shibuya was in the spotlight as a ““music city connected to the world. ’’A network of sounds spreading from the 7th floor of Tower Records. Pizzicato Five, Cornelius, Kenji Ozawa. The pop sensibilities imported from overseas were simultaneously redefined as Japanese cool. 2. The rise of club cultureLined with clubs such as WOMB, Contact, and Vision, late at night Shibuya is filled with electronic pulses. A city where house, techno, and hip-hop intersect, melting the boundaries between information and body, digital and analog. Chapter 3: Shimokitazawa - The Mecca of Independents1. Democratization of music starts in the studioIn the late 1980s, young people gathered with guitars in Shimokitazawa, a neighborhood dotted with small studios and live music venues. “Shimokita” became a symbol of indie music, and was the birthplace of Number Girl, ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION, Kururi, and others. 2. “Create your own music culture”Independent production, ZINE, and SNS without going through a record company. Inheriting the DIY spirit of music, Shimokitazawa still pulsates with live houses such as BASEMENT BAR and SHELTER. Chapter 4: Akihabara - Fusion of electronic sounds and otaku culture1. From techno pop to anime song remixThe lineage of electronic sounds built by YMO in the 1980s evolved once again in Akihabara in the 2000s. Game music, vocaloids, chip tunes, anime song remixes. Although it is a melting pot of subculture, it has formed a new context that connects to the world’s electronic scene. 2. The sound of Akihabara is “augmented reality”A city where “music” and “technology” are fused. Live streaming, VTuber, AI music. Akihabara is a ““futuristic pop testing ground,’’ and is evolving on a different timeline than other areas of Tokyo. Chapter 5: Intersecting rhythms of TokyoImprovisation at night in Shinjuku, beats in Shibuya, band sounds in Shimokitazawa, electronic sounds in Akihabara. Although these have independent contexts, they are now intertwined with each other. A Shibuya-raised truck maker incorporates Akihabara aesthetics, and a Shimokitazawa singer references Shinjuku jazz rhythms. **Tokyo’s sound exists as a “multilayered remix. ” ** Chapter 6: Soundscape as urban memoryThe sounds of the city disappear. However, it is also an accumulation. The reverberations of rhythms left on the walls of old buildings, the floorboards of demolished live music venues, and broken speakers. All of them make up the huge sound archive that is Tokyo. Conclusion: Towards the future of music city TokyoWhere will the next Tokyo sound come from?AI-generated music, virtual clubs, and live music on the streets. Although the form may change, the structure of ““a city that speaks with sound’’ remains the same. The nights in Shinjuku, the clubs in Shibuya, and the cyberspace in Akihabara will continue to reverberate into the future as one “Tokyo beat. ” Chronology: Changes in Tokyo Sound (1950–2025)flowchart TDA1950[ 1950s: The birth of jazz cafe culture in Shinjuku ]A1970[ 1970s: Fusion of underground theater and rock (Shinjuku LOFT) ]A1990[ 1990s: The rise of Shibuya-kei pops and club culture ]A2000[ 2000s: Vocaloid and remix culture spread from Akihabara ]A2010[ 2010s: Revival of Shimokitazawa Indies and Festival Culture ]A2020[ 2020s: The rise of AI music and virtual city live performances ]A1950 --&gt; A1970A1970 --&gt; A1990A1990 --&gt; A2000A2000 --&gt; A2010A2010 --&gt; A2020Illustration: Multi-layered structure of Tokyo music culturegraph LRsubgraph groundShibuya[ Shibuya: Club Pop ]Shimokita[ Shimokitazawa: Band Indies ]endsubgraph undergroundShinjuku[ Shinjuku: Jazz Underground ]Akiba[ Akihabara: electronic sound/subculture ]endShibuya --&gt; AkibaShimokita --&gt; ShinjukuShinjuku --&gt; ShibuyaReferences/Discography   Pizzicato Five “Made in USA” (1995)     YMO “Solid State Survivor” (1979)     RC Succession “Single Man” (1976)     Cornelius “Fantasma” (1997)     Perfume “GAME” (2008)     Number Girl “SAPPUKEI” (2000)  "

    "title": "[Column] Silent music: Rediscovering the act of listening",
    "body": "Prologue: What do we listen to in music without sound?      Text: mmr   Theme: After John Cage’s ““4 minutes and 33 seconds,’’ silence became another aspect of music. What is listening? Considering the reconstruction of the relationship between humans and the world as told by music without sound   When John Cage”s ““4”33’’ premiered in New York in 1952, audiences were perplexed and agitated. The pianist doesn’t play a single note. However, the venue was filled with sounds: coughs, chairs creaking, and the wind outside. At that moment, it became clear that music is not just composed sounds, but the act of listening itself. Cage speaks. “There is no silence. Everything is sound. ”This philosophy greatly expanded the realm of music and was passed on to 21st century sound art, field recording, and ambient music. Chapter 1: What is listening to sound? — Listening as sensory retrainingWe do too much “unconscious listening” in our daily lives. Smartphone notification sounds, subway announcements, street noises. They recede into the background of consciousness and become just a piece of information. However, Cage and the composers of musique concrète encouraged us to practice rediscovering listening. Listening is an act of renewing one’s relationship with the world,It is an attitude of accepting ““the sounds that already exist’’ rather than choosing a sound. This attitude would later be carried over to Brian Eno’s ambient music. he speaks. ““Ambient music is music that exists with the environment, even if you don’t consciously listen to it. ’’ Chapter 2: Genealogy of Silence — From Cage to Contemporary Sound ArtAfter Cage, “silence” became a kind of musical material. Below is a chronology showing its genealogy. timelinetitle Art history of silence and listening (1950–2020)1952: Premiere of John Cage's 4 minutes 33 seconds - presents the concept of silence1967: Max Newhouse  Sound Walk —Art as an act of listening to the city1978: Brian Eno  Ambient 1: Music for Airports —Designing listening spaces1994: Ryuichi Sakamoto  Schola  series — Philosophical consideration of sound and time2005: Janet Cardiff  Audio Walks —Experiencing movement and hearing2020: AI sound generation and redefining silence — an era where  silence  is analyzed as dataIn this trend, silence has been treated not as a “blank space” but as a “possibility. ”In other words, when the act of listening becomes a theme, music transcends its framework. ** Chapter 3: Music as environment — the birth of soundscapesIn the late 1960s, Canadian composer R. Marie Schaefer proposed the concept of “soundscape. ”This was an attempt to understand sound as part of society, culture, and the natural environment. “We live in a landscape of sound. To listen is to understand the environment. ” The hustle and bustle of the city, the rustling of the forest, the babbling of the river—recording and editing them became a musical act in itself. This idea continues in today’s field recording culture and artists who incorporate environmental sounds (Ryuichi Sakamoto, Chris Watson, etc. ). Chapter 4: Ethics of Silence — Empathy brought about by “listening”The act of listening is not just a sensation. It is also an ethical attitude of being open to others. In the field of music therapy, ““listening to sounds” is often combined with ““accepting others” training. Sociologist James Calhoun also points out that ““silence in public spaces is disappearing. ’’Constantly playing background music, constant flow of information. Have we become afraid of “time without sound”? Recovering silence also means regaining the ability to listen to music. Chapter 5: Silence in the Digital Age — Amidst the Sea of ​​NoiseWhat Spotify and YouTube offer is “chosen silence. ”For example, the “Lo-Fi Chill” and “Focus” playlists are filled with “sounds” meant to create silence. Paradoxically, there is a consumption of production of tranquility. On the other hand, AI music generation technology continues to produce infinite sounds. Among these, what listeners may be looking for is a ““moment without sound. ’’In other words, the value of silence in an age of digital saturation is resurfacing.

Silence functions not as a space for playing music, but as a space for thinking and empathy. Conclusion: The Future of Silence — Toward a Politics of ListeningSilence will likely become a new form of resistance in future music culture. Information overload, instant pleasure, and algorithmic music selection. In this context, listening becomes a kind of slow listening exercise. When we regain the verb “listen,”Music once again connects us with the world.

    "title": "[Column] Rhythm created by the city night: Sociology of club culture",
    "body": "The moment the city night begins to ringText: mmr｜Theme: Unraveling the club culture that has evolved along with changes in the social structure of cities from the perspectives of sociology, cultural history, and technology. The city is both a place for work during the day and a device for regaining freedom at night. Club culture is just another face of modern society created by this ““night city. ’’After the Industrial Revolution, when the boundaries between work and leisure, day and night, and order and deviation were clearly delineated, people escaped into the night streets and created new communities through music and their bodies. Chapter 1: The rhythmic device of the city — industrialization and the liberation of the nightIndustrial cities at the end of the 19th century realized a ““24-hour society’’ with night lighting. When the lights come on, the city at night transforms into a place not only for work but also for entertainment and desire. What emerged was a space that became the prototype for dance halls, cabaret, and disco. As urban sociologist Lewis Wirth points out, ““cities are lifestyles predicated on anonymity and diversity. ’’The darkness of the club is the ultimate in anonymity. As everyone surrenders to the sound as a nobody, boundaries of class, gender, and race temporarily disappear. Chapter 2: From disco to rave — the democratization of the night and the politics of the bodyDiscotheques in the 1970s served as a platform for expression of the LGBTQ community and black culture. Studio 54 and Paradise Garage were “sonic emancipation zones” for people who were pushed to the margins of society, but they were also political spaces. At the end of the 1980s, rave culture emerged with acid house and fled outside the city. Warehouses, fields, abandoned factories—dancing in uncontrolled spaces was also a form of resistance to the control of time by the state and capital. Music is both protest and celebration. Chapter 3: Berlin, Tokyo, London — Comparison of club culture by cityBerlinAfter the wall fell, the ruined city became a testing ground for freedom. Clubs like Tresor, Berghain, and Watergate were born out of the chaotic blending of Eastern and Western cultures. Clubs are not just entertainment; they function as a ““new public sphere of society. ’’ TokyoTokyo’s clubs were a “secret escape device” in a city of regulation and control. Like Shibuya WOMB, Shinjuku LIQUIDROOM, and Aoyama Zero, sounds are heard in the gaps in the city. However, Japan’s club law (Entertainment Business Law) has long restricted the freedom to dance. It is this tension that forms the uniqueness of Tokyo’s night culture. LondonIn London, the epicenter of rave culture, there were repeated ““wars of sound’’ between police and young people. But at the same time, music became a means of social inclusion. ““Fabric” and ““Ministry of Sound” are symbols of the ““nighttime economy,’’ where sound and economy are linked. Chapter 4: Interface between sound and urban space — architecture, technology, and physicalityThe club”s architecture reconfigures the city”s soundscape. Bass sounds, laser beams, and smoke echo in the inorganic concrete space. They are both architectural devices and interfaces that connect the body and technology. The DJ booth is the ““conductor of the city,” and the sound system is the ““nervous system of society. ”As technology advances, the form of clubs changes and so do the politics of sound. Chapter 5: Gender and the public sphere of the night — the intersection of security and desireWhile clubs are places of freedom, they are also places of danger for women and sexual minorities. In night culture research, the concept of ““safe night’’ has been attracting attention. The emergence of female DJs and feminist parties is an attempt to redefine the nighttime public sphere. Who is the freedom of the night for?This question is also the key to predicting the future of club culture. Chapter 6: “Night” after the pandemic — digital clubs and new communitiesWhen the coronavirus pandemic closed the doors of clubs, sound moved to the internet. New club communities have been born in the digital space, such as “Boiler Room,” “Club Quarantine,” and “Twitch DJ distribution. ”Although the city fell silent, the rhythm of the night did not stop. Dancing online was also a ritual for my isolated body to regain its “resonance”. Digital clubs may be the germ of a new kind of “public nature” in 21st century urban society. Conclusion: Where is the urban rhythm headed?The city night has always been a mirror that reflects the shadows and desires of society. In its mirror, club culture has given form to the fundamental human desire for resonance. Even in an era of evolving AI and digital technology, the rhythm of the night will not disappear. It is the “heartbeat” of the gigantic body that is the city.

    "title": "[Column] Creation alone: ​​The era of the bedroom producer",
    "body": "Prologue: From an empty room to the worldText: mmr｜Theme: From one computer to the world. The revolutionary history of music born in the bedroom and its social and cultural meanings It’s no longer just yesterday that music production can now be completed in a ““room. ’’However, this has become “normal” since the 21st century, when digitalization has reached its maximum. The magic of music production, once confined to the walls of a studio, has finally descended into everyone’s rooms thanks to laptops and inexpensive audio interfaces, DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations). A bedroom producer is not just someone who creates sound alone. They are the embodiment of the ““democratization” of the music industry, and at the same time they are also a symbol of the ““creativity of solitude. ”Nowadays, with direct access to the world via Spotify and SoundCloud, the bedroom is no longer a “private space. ” Through its network, it has become the base of a new music city = digital city. Chapter 1: Democratization of recording technology — from cassette MTR to DAWCassette MTR opens the door to personal productionIn the 1980s, the cassette MTR (multi-track recorder) released by companies such as TASCAM and Fostex laid the origin of home recording culture. The fact that even lo-fi sound quality can be overdubbed at home has given amateur musicians the possibility of ““self-sufficiency. ’’The seeds of this development had already begun when Ryuichi Sakamoto was making demos in his home studio and home-recording artists were distributing their sound sources along with zines. Computer and MIDI revolutionIn the 1990s, MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) became popular. An era began when Roland and Yamaha synthesizers were connected to computers, and the boundaries between ““composition” and ““recording” disappeared. This is where the uniquely Japanese term ““DTM (Desk Top Music)’’ appeared. Composers now have desk studios, and music flows from their personal desks. Chapter 2: Birth of Software StudioThe revolution called DAWIn the 2000s, with the advent of Pro Tools, Cubase, Logic Pro, and Ableton Live, DTM evolved into a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Recording, editing, mixing, and mastering can all be completed on one PC. Furthermore, the proliferation of plug-in sound sources and sample packs has made physical studio equipment unnecessary. This eliminates the need for bedroom producers to “imitate” studios. Rather, they began to use the ““restricted space’’ itself as a source of expression. Noises from outside, the creak of the bed, the sound of breathing in the middle of the night. They were incorporated as part of the music. Chapter 3: The era of SoundCloud and YouTube — “Share” and “Discover”New “release” formSoundCloud in 2007, YouTube in 2005. These platforms have become ““windows’’ for individuals to communicate directly to the world. The era has come when music can reach listeners around the world with just one piece of data, without having to go through traditional label contracts or distribution networks. Individuals discoveredClairo, Cuco, Joji, Porter Robinson, Madeon, Sasakure. UK…. What they all have in common is that they all started in a room. But at the same time, it has become a global musical phenomenon. In the silence of their bedrooms, they shared their feelings with young people around the world through YouTube and social media. Chapter 4: Creating solitude — the relationship between mind and bodyThe bedroom is also a symbol of isolation. The freedom to decide everything by yourself and create everything by yourself, on the other hand, also brings about the anxiety of being responsible for everything. Because one person can handle everything from production, release, promotion, and social media support, the support of a society with a division of labor is gone. However, that solitude is the source of modern creativity. Music has changed from a ““social act” to ““individual meditation. ”The result of introspection is a sound that is at once more personal and universal than ever before. Chapter 5: AI and Modular — Re-extending the BedroomIn the 2020s, AI composition and modular synths are back in the bedroom. AI expands human creativity as an assistant, and modularity restores the analog sensibility of ““contingency. ’’Music production is evolving from the ““world of individuals” to ““co-creation between individuals and machines. ” The waveforms generated on the DAW screen look like digital paintings. Nowadays, the bedroom has transformed into an atelier for not only music, but also for all-round creation. Chapter 6: Japanese Bedroom CultureImpact of Hatsune Miku and VocaloidIn Japan, Hatsune Miku, introduced in 2007, has become a symbol of bedroom culture. Through the fusion of voice synthesis software and the Internet, an anonymous producer creates hit songs one after another. supercell, DECO27, ryo, wowaka…Their activities presented a new structure called ““pop music without an author. ’’ The intersection of Niconico Douga and YouTubeAs comment culture and derivative works intertwine in multiple layers, the bedroom has transformed into a place for collaborative production. ““Creating by one person” eventually became meaningful in a network where ““many people resonated together. ” Illustration: Modern music production structureflowchart TDA[ Bedroom (personal space) ] --&gt; B[ DAW (production/editing) ]B --&gt; C[ SNS / SoundCloud / YouTube (announcement) ]C --&gt; D[ Listener (listeners around the world) ]D --&gt; E[ Feedback (comment/share) ]E --&gt; A[ Reproduction (Update Remix) ]classDef default fill:#fff8d1,stroke:#555,color:#333;Chronology: Evolution of Bedroom Creation (1970–2025)timelinetitle Evolution of bedroom production (1970–2025)1970: Home recording culture emerges with the lo-fi movement1983: MIDI standard is born and the concept of DTM is established. 1995: Cubase/Logic becomes popular among general users2005: YouTube debuts, merging video and music at home2007: SoundCloud and Hatsune Miku appear, and personal productions spread around the world2013: Porter Robinson's  Worlds  mainstreams bedroom aesthetics2020: Home recording production becomes standard due to the coronavirus pandemic2025: Toward an era of  new personal music  that combines AI, modular, and internet collaborationConclusion: The bedroom is another form of the cityThe sound of Bedroom Producer is the sound of solitude echoing in a corner of the city. At the same time, it is also the sound of solidarity that connects countless rooms through a network. It is a new form of community that replaces “clubs” and “festivals. ” Music is back in the hands of individuals. And those hands are no longer connected through the mouse or MIDI keyboard. Directly connected to the entire world.  “From my room to your world. ”    That may be the most honest picture of music in the 21st century.  "

    "title": "[Column] Why do we buy records when we are tired of digital: Psychology of returning to records",
    "body": "Prologue: Escape from the perfect sound      Text: mmr   Theme: Why do people abandon digital perfection and return to analog imperfection? Exploring the psychology and culture of returning to records   Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music. We are now in an era where sounds from all over the world are available with just a tap. However, amidst all this perfect convenience, a strange backlash is occurring. –It’s the revival of records. It’s not a temporary boom like cassettes, butNowadays, LP discs are definitely regaining their cultural status. The action of dropping the needle, the feel of opening the jacket, the fluctuation of the surface of the board. It’s more like a ritual than “listening. ” Why do people return to inconvenient media?The psychological ““desire for contact” and ““memory circuits” are deeply involved. Chapter 1: Memories of “touch” taken away by digitalWhen the CD was introduced in 1982, the world rejoiced. Noiseless, long-lasting, and highly durable. Music has become data, and media has become transparent. However, that transparency was the “problem”. Digital sound is so perfect that it lacks a sense of presence. Sounds you can’t touch, playlists you can replace. What psychologist Winnicott calls a “transitional object”In other words, the presence of a ““stuffed toy’’ that makes children feel safe has been lost in music. Records are the exact opposite. The discs are heavy, absorb dust, are sensitive to temperature, and even spin out of order. It is like a ““living thing’’ and will not make a sound unless you touch it. This troublesomeness actually creates attachment. Chapter 2: Memories in Noise – Analog and NostalgiaThe moment the needle drops, there’s a ““sah’’ noise. For some reason, many people feel nostalgic just by listening to it. This phenomenon is psychologically called the “Proust effect. ”This is a phenomenon in which stimulation of the five senses, such as smells and sounds, evokes memories. The noise of the record makes the passage of time itself audible. In other words, the act of listening to a record is also ““an act of reuniting with the past. ’’ If digital sound is “currently ongoing” sound,Analog sound is the “reverberation of memory. ” Chapter 3: Analog nature sought by the body - from the perspective of brain scienceHuman hearing has the ability to detect “fluctuations” in continuous waves. Analog sound is a physical waveform,Contains fluctuations that are closer to “natural sounds” than digital sounds. This subtle fluctuation (1/f fluctuation) isIt is known to resonate with alpha brain waves and produce a relaxing effect. In other words, analog records are comfortable noise for the body. Unconsciously, we seek a sound that is not too formal. Chapter 4: Media Archeology - Music as MaterialRecords are also sound sculptures. The act of carving out sound is to confine time into matter. Friedrich Kittler stated this in ““Media Archeology. ’’  “Media determine our situation. ”(The media determines our situation) As sound evolves from “recording” to “playback”,Records remained as the only medium that allowed us to touch time. When you put the needle down, it makes a sound, and when you raise it, silence returns. Within this simple mechanism, there is a dialogue between time and the body. Chapter 5: Why Gen Z is dropping the needle - A new sense of ownershipGeneration Z record buyersActually, I don’t know about the “analog era”. Still, they “buy” records and “display them” on their shelves. For them, records are not ““archives” or ““collections. ”Rather, it functions as “evidence of experience. ” The artistry of the jacket, the act of turning the disc over,Physical steps not in the app. This is also an expression of anti-transparency culture in the digital age. Chapter 6: Future Nostalgia ─ Analog Emotions in the AI ​​EraMusic can now be generated infinitely thanks to generation AI. Fluid ““generative music’’ where you can never play the same song twice. As a reaction to this, people are starting to seek fixed substances. “Analog regression” is no longer a nostalgic thing. That is rediscovering ““humanity’’ in the age of AI. Final Chapter: Records teach us “happiness of imperfection”The sound of records is not perfect. Distortion, dust, and deterioration of the disc – all of that is etched into the sound. But that’s what a “living sound” is all about. Psychologically, people tend to “attach to imperfections” rather than to perfection. Accept that imperfection as part of yourself. That’s the appeal of it as the “ghost of analog. ” –Records are not tombstones for music. Rather, human memory itself is a rotating device.

The analog ghost is more than just a retro hobby. It is a symbol of the question of how humans interact with memory, touch, and time. The ““soul of sound’’ that resides at the tip of the needle continues to rotate quietly.

    "body": "Prologue: What remains after sound becomes “data”      Text: mmr   Theme: Adding a data perspective to the psychology of record regression. Graphing the global Vinyl Revival from 2000 to 2025   In the 2020s, when music consumption became completely digital, a ““return to analog”’ was quietly progressing behind the playlists played by Spotify”s algorithm. Chapter 1: The intersection of data and psychologyBehind the resurgence of records are psychological desires and social reactions. The movement to reclaim the physical musical experience is also an unconscious rebellion of the digital generation. The graph below shows global record sales trends from 2000 to 2025. It can be seen that while CDs are in decline, vinyl is making a comeback and is on the rise. World record sales trends (2000–2025)%% Vinyl Revival: 2000–2025timelinetitle World record sales trends (2000–2025/based on IFPI estimated data)2000: Worldwide sales approximately $300 million (in a corner of the market)2005: Downturn — the rise of digital distribution2010 : Indie re-evaluation/Record Store Day established2015: Exceeded $1 billion (+30% compared to the previous year)2018 : LP overturns CD sales (UK)2020: Global sales approximately 1. 2 billion dollars (steady despite the coronavirus pandemic)2023: Highest record in the US since 1987 (RIAA)2025: World market approximately $2. 5 billion — Revival of physical musicChapter 2: “Resurrection of rituals” told by numbersEconomic data may seem cold, but it is also a mirror reflecting the heat of culture. The increase in record sales is not just about nostalgia;It is a symbol of the new consumer behavior of “buying experiences. ” In particular, many of the Gen Z buyers are the “digital generation” themselves. For them, records function as ““unknown classics’’ - a new narrative device. Chapter 3: Media Archeology and the Psychology of OwnershipBehind the transparency of digital, the materiality of analog shines once again. Music recording media do more than just store information. It is a medium that visualizes human concepts such as “time,” “deterioration,” and “memory. ” The ring of records symbolizes the cycle of time. It is a metaphor for “music” itself,“The act of listening is a ritual of reuniting with time. ” Chapter 4: Effects of records on the brainAccording to research in psychology and brain science,The human brain feels pleasure in sounds that have “fluctuations”. Fine noise and fluctuations contained in analog sound areResonating with the natural phenomenon called 1/f fluctuation,It has the effect of calming the rhythm of heartbeat and brain waves. ──In other words, listening to records is also an act of ““conditioning the autonomic nervous system of the mind. ’’ Chapter 5: Future analog ─ Reaction in the AI ​​eraIn an era where AI can generate music infinitely,“Sounds that cannot be reproduced” and “trace of matter” areParadoxically, it is beginning to acquire scarcity value. Records in the era of AI-generated musicIt will continue to be an “anti-algorithmic entity”. pie title Global Vinyl Market Share (2025 estimate) North America  ​​: 42 Europe  : 30 Asia Pacific  : 18 South America/Others : 10Conclusion: The future inside a rotating diskWe live in an age where data is at its peak, and algorithms control everything. Under these circumstances, people are once again seeking “material sound. ” Records never die. Rather, as a symbol of the rotation of human memory and emotions,It continues to quietly and surely turn to the future. "

    "title": "[Column] Music and memory: When melody transcends time",
    "body": "Prologue: Melody is the key to unlocking memoriesText: mmr｜Theme: Why does music evoke memories? An anthropological study of sound as an archive of melody, time, and emotion At one moment, a melody plays on the radio, instantly bringing back the scenery that he had forgotten for years. This is the power of sound memory, similar to smell. Neuroscience has also shown that music directly stimulates the hippocampus (memory) and amygdala (emotions). But more than that, music is an ““art of time” and a ““reenactment of the past. ” Listening to music is not just entertainment, but a physical act of replaying the past. It existed even before recording technology was invented; it was a way for humans to “share memories” through voice and rhythm. Chapter 1: Memory and Rhythm — Music as a “structure of time”The most fundamental structure of music is rhythm. Rhythm is the order of time, and through repetition it brings the past back into the present. Festivals, prayers, and dances. All of these are acts of experiencing the circle of time. Carving out a rhythm is the very act of consolidating memory. In ancient oral culture, poems and myths were passed down in rhythm. This is because people feel that rhythm is easy to remember and resonates with the body. **Music = Rhythmization of memory. **This structure has been inherited even in the era after recording media. Spotify playlists are also just a new format. Chapter 2: Recording and Playback — Birth of “Recorded Time”At the beginning of the 20th century, when Edison’s phonograph appeared, humans were able to reproduce the ““sounds of the past’’ for the first time. It was a revolution in the history of music, and at the same time it was the birth of ““technology to preserve time. ’’ Records, tapes, CDs, MP3s, and streaming. Recording technology advanced the ““archiving of sound’’ and expanded human memory.  Melodies go beyond personal memories and form social memories. For example, listening to popular songs that were played in post-war Japan brings back the atmosphere of that era. Music records the ““temperature of the time’’ more directly than history books. Chapter 3: The Science of Nostalgia and Emotional MemoryMusic makes people cry, not so much because of the sound itself, but because they are reunited with their ““past selves. ’’Psychologically, melodies and harmonies function as memory “tags. ” When we listen to a certain song, we unconsciously replay the ““smell, light, and wind’’ of that time at the same time. Sound is a time machine, and melody is the key to memory. Music listened to in childhood, in particular, has a high level of brain plasticity, so it becomes a core emotional core throughout a person’s life. The phenomenon of ““nostalgic melodies” being revived on Spotify and YouTube is evidence of their role as cultural ““memory reproduction devices. ” Chapter 4: Transforming Media and Memory — Listening Experiences in the Age of AlgorithmsIn the past, the moment a person selected a record and dropped the needle, there was a ““rebirth of memory. ’’However, in modern times, AI predicts our ““mood’’ based on our past playback history. Spotify”s ““Discover Weekly” and Apple Music”s ““Personal Mix” are attempts at algorithmic memory editing. But there is also danger lurking there. We may be listening to “memory as data” rather than “our own memory. ”  Human nostalgia is being externalized by algorithms. At this time, music becomes not an individual’s internal memory, but a network memory (collective digital memory). Chapter 5: The body that remembers — synapses between music and the brain and emotionsMusic is memorized not only in the brain but also in the body. Just as musicians say that their hands remember a phrase once they have memorized it. Bodily working memory (procedural memory) is closely linked to auditory memory. dancing, singing, and playing. These are “memory reproductions through the resonance of sound and the body. ”In other words, listening to music is becoming yourself from that time again. Chapter 6: Music and Collective Memory — From National Anthems to FestivalsWhat Benedict Anderson calls an ““imagined community’’ isIt has been supported by “shared music” such as the national anthem and school song. However, in modern times, ““collective memory’’ is born on the floors of festivals and clubs, not in countries. The moment people listen to the same song in a crowd, they transcend the individual and connect to a ““sound community. ’’ It is a new “ritual” of the 21st century and a renewal of memory. Chapter 7: Music of Silence — Between Oblivion and RebirthWhere there is memory, there is always forgetting. What John Cage’s ““4 minutes 33 seconds” shows is the ““redefinition of hearing” hidden in silence. Music is not ““what you listen to,” but ““what you can remember. ”This question is the philosophical core of the connection between memory and melody. Final chapter: When the melody transcends timeEvery time we listen to a song, we travel back and forth in time. It is both a “reenactment of the past” and a “reconstruction of the present. ” And even after the music stops, the melody continues to ring somewhere in my heart. Music is an art form of memory itself.

    "title": "[Column] Body and Beat: Anthropology of Dance Music",
    "body": "Introduction: Why are people moved by rhythm?Text: mmr｜Theme: Why do people dance? An anthropological exploration of the relationship between the beat and the body, from ancient rituals to club culture to the rhythms of the AI ​​era. When you hear a sound on the dance floor, your body reacts before logic. My feet and hips unconsciously begin to beat. This is a feeling that goes before ““listening” and is a completely different perceptual circuit from ““understanding” music. Anthropologist Andre Leroy-GourandHe defined human culture as the “extension of the body. ”Just like stone tools and writing, rhythm is also an extension of the human body. In other words, dancing is the first technology of civilization. Chapter 1: Drums and Ritual - The Origin of Rhythm1. The birth of sound was accompanied by “breathing”From an archaeological perspective, the earliest “musical instruments” were percussion instruments. It is a stone or tree beaten for hunting or prayer,Creating a “beat” was also an act of creating a community. In many tribal societies in Africa and Oceania,The drum was both a means of transmitting information and a central part of rituals. The rhythm of heartbeat is a metaphor for life,Rhythm was a code for the body to communicate with the outside world. 2. Dance that ticks the “beat” of the communityDancing is often referred to as ““nonverbal communication. ’’However, its essence lies rather in the reconfirmation of society through the resonance of the body. Festival dances and religious trances areIt was a device that melted the “self” in a rhythmic flow that transcended the individual. timelinetitle Chronology of the evolution of dance and music50000BC: Appearance of percussion instruments and dance in hunting rituals10000BC: Agricultural rituals and drum rhythms1600: Baroque dance music (formalized for the court)1900: Birth of jazz and ballroom dancing1970: Disco and psychedelic culture1989: The fall of the Berlin Wall and rave culture2020: AI rhythm generation and the emergence of online clubsChapter 2: Machine Rhythm - Technology and the Reorganization of the Body1. From the invention of the metronome to clubsThe 19th century metronomeIt was the first technology to ““digitize’’ the human sense of rhythm. As an extension of that, there are rhythm machines, sequencers, and DJ mixers. Technology is not just a tool to reproduce sound;It has functioned as a device that redefines the body’s sense of time. 2. Machines guide the body - revolution in techno and raveIn the 1980s, when Detroit techno and Chicago house emerged,People began to surrender to the beat of the machine rather than the live performance. Homogeneous BPM, looping beat. It seems to erase “human imperfection”,On the contrary, it had the power to drag the body into pure rhythmic pleasure. In the early 1990s, when rave culture expanded,A phenomenon was born in which countless bodies synchronized in a whirlpool of sound. A “resonating crowd” that transcends social and political frameworks. It was a modern version of an ancient ritual. Chapter 3: Dancing Cities - Berlin, Tokyo, and “Places of the Body”1. Berlin: Ruins and Techno FreedomImmediately after the fall of the Wall, Berlin was a lawless zone and a testing ground for freedom. Clubs like Tresor and BerghainIt created a new physical community in a city awaiting political and economic restructuring. There, ““dancing’’ itself isIt was a political act of memory and rebirth. 2. Tokyo: Between regulation and creativityJapan’s club culture matured under the legal constraints of the Entertainment Business Act. In this country, where dancing was once considered illegal,People searched for new ways to move their bodies in time with sound. Shibuya, Daikanyama, Shimokitazawa, and local small boxes――Secret dance venues formed the underworld of the city. 3. Online floor: the emergence of the digital bodySince the pandemic, the club has expanded online. Bodies dancing through the screen, avatar movements, and AI-generated DJ sets. Yet people still respond to rhythm. The body may not be a substance, but a network of resonance. flowchart TBsubgraph Relationship diagram between the human body and beatsA[External sound stimulation] --&gt; B[Auditory processing by the ears]B --&gt; C [Brain rhythm perception]C --&gt; D [activation of motor cortex]D --&gt; E[Body movement (dancing)]E --&gt; F [Social Resonance/Community Sense]F --&gt; CendChapter 4: Trance and Ecstasy - Dance as Transformation of Consciousness1. Ancient layer in trance stateDance is not just entertainment; it is also a technique for changing consciousness. In shamanistic rituals,Long rhythmic repetition induces a trance state,People have become people who listen to the voices of others. Modern club music is structurally similar. Repetition of BPM120-140 resonates with brain waves,Producing a moment when the body surpasses consciousness. Drugs and lighting are also just secondary triggers for sound. 2. From “individual” to “group”: Sociology of dancing crowdsWhat sociologist Durkheim refers to as “collective effervescence” isIt is a moment when the energy of the community is simultaneously energized. The club’s dance floor is a modern recreation of exactly that. A place where lonely individuals can connect with others through rhythm. It’s a more primitive and much more physical empathic device than social media. Chapter 5: AI and the rhythm of the future - will machines dance?AI-generated music can now be freely manipulated in terms of BPM and emotion. However, the problem is not that machines can make people dance. Rather, the question is how humans empathize with the rhythms of machines. When the human body responds to the beats created by AI,It’s no longer a human versus machine relationship. An “extended body” as a resonant being is born. Rhythm will become the new language of communication. Conclusion: Beat is the memory of the bodyEven if music is converted into data and rhythms are programmed,Humans never stop dancing. This is not an instinct, but a function of the body as a memory. With each beat, we reaffirm the rhythm of life. What is dancing?Once I dismantle my individual self,It is the oldest and newest act of re-synchronizing with the world. "

    "title": "[Column] The era of music without boundaries: AI, nostalgia, and \"sound for the occasion\"",
    "body": "Prologue: An era when music is listened to in “context”      Text: mmr   Theme: An era where AI creates music and humans reinterpret it. In a creative environment dominated by generative AI, where does “humanity” reside? Cultural considerations regarding the reconstruction of music and sensibilities in the post-AI era   Music in 2025 will no longer be talked about in terms of “genre. ”The listening experience on Spotify and Apple Music is being reorganized to fit the mood, time, and occasion, going beyond the categories of “rock,” “hip-hop,” and “electronica. ”  ”Listening on a rainy day,” ““Track at 2 a. m. ” and ““A morning spent with coffee. ” These list titles indicate a new value: ““context over genre. ”Music is talked about not in terms of what it’s made of, but in terms of how it resonates/fits situations. At the heart of this change are AI, nostalgia, and the listener’s own “memory. ” Chapter 1: “Democratization of composition” brought about by AI and the value of “human context”AI music generation tools - Suno, Udio, AIVA, Stable Audio. In the field of 2025, these will dissolve the boundaries between professionals and amateurs. ““Creating” music is no longer a specialized skill, but has become ““giving form to ideas. ” AI “makes sounds”, humans “choose meanings”For example, electronica artist Arca treats AI sound as a material and combines it with his own real voice. What she does is ““context design that asks why you should choose one out of the countless possibilities created by AI. ’’Similarly, James Blake from the UK created an album [ ”Playing Robots Into Heaven” (2024)] (https://amzn. to/3L1hE6D) with the theme of ““human fragility” while treating AI as a ““co-author. ’’ What these examples show is that AI is becoming less of a ““creator of sound” and more of a ““mirror that highlights what people choose. ”Precisely because the tools are open to everyone, what is being questioned is the individual’s contextual power = the meaning of choice. Chapter 2: Nostalgia and sound images surrounding “the future of the past”The “2000s throwback” is causing big waves in the music scene, especially on TikTok. Songs from Avril Lavigne and The Killers are going viral again, and at the same time young artists are reinventing the “Y2K aesthetic. ” Recycling and reinventing 2000s soundsIn the United States, Chappell Roan broke through with “Midwest Princess” (2024), which combined 2000s pop sensibilities with queer expression. In Japan, Wednesday Campanella is reconstructing the lightness of ’00s J-Pop with an AI-like beat feel. These ““retro-futuristic” music function between ““nostalgia” and ““current irony. ’’In other words, we are re-enacting the ““future of those days”’ using today”s technology and sensibilities. Towards “Nostalgia that does not imitate oldness”What is important here is the attitude of ““re-editing rather than imitation. ’’As exemplified by playlists such as ““Retro-Future Pop” and ““Y2K Wave” on Spotify, current nostalgia brings the ““sound texture” to the past, but the ““production context” is modern. For example, Charli XCX’s ““BRAT’’ (2024) samples 90s club culture while also exploring the theme of post-internet self-consciousness. Her “method of turning past sounds into material” can be said to be sampling the history of music itself. Chapter 3: Local music overrides global contextThe speed at which music crosses borders has changed dramatically in the age of social media. At the heart of this is a wave of local origins such as Afrobeats, Amapiano, Latin Trap, K-pop, and a reappraisal of City Pop. Afrobeats and Amapiano: Mainstream sounds from the SouthNigerian artists Burna Boy and Rema are topping the world charts, and Amapiano’s beats are cited by producers in Los Angeles and London. The center of gravity of pop rhythms, which used to be centered around Western Europe, is now shifting to southern hemisphere grooves. The tempo is slow, the kick is deep, the bass is organic - “stillness for dancing” has become a new form of pleasure. City Pop Re-evaluation: Reimported from the EastAfter the Japanese song [Mariya Takeuchi “Plastic Love”] (https://amzn. to/3J6YPhZ) became viral again overseas, City Pop was reorganized globally as “Asian Nostalgia. ”As of 2025, young artists from Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea are re-creating the “Oriental Dream” by quoting City Pop-style chord progressions and textures. The center of global pop is not just Los Angeles, but has expanded to Bangkok, Seoul, and Tokyo. Chapter 4: Live performances and fandom as “participatory music”The concept of live music is also in the midst of change. The culture of live streaming, which has spread due to the coronavirus pandemic, has not ended, and is now changing into a new, regular form called “hybrid live. ” From Metaverse to “Augmented Reality”Travis Scott’s ““Utopia Experience” in 2024 combined a real venue and AR projection to create a ““live experience that the audience can experience spatially. ”In Japan, Perfume also incorporated AR production to show fans an “alternate reality stage” through their smartphones. The value of a live performance has shifted to how much you can design the ““memories of the place” and ““shared moments. ” Community in the Fan Direct eraA fan-direct ecosystem using Patreon, Bandcamp, and Discord is maturing. For example, Grimes has officially opened up her AI voice and allowed fans to “make songs with her voice. ”This shift from “listening” to “participating” transforms music into a “community experience. ” Chapter 5: Sound Trends - Coexistence of stillness and densitySound trends themselves are also changing. The characteristic of 2025 is the coexistence of stillness (Minimal) and density (Maximal). “Quiet club” and “introspective electronica”The popularity of ““slow grooves” such as Afro House and Amapiano symbolizes an era in which dancing can also be ““introspection”. Sets of 100 to 110 BPM are becoming the norm in clubs in Berlin and Seoul, creating a space where you can “think while dancing. ”In Japan, food festivals a. k. a foodman and yahyel are exploring “quiet club music. ” On the contrary, there is also a movement to master “density”On the other hand, in the post-hyperpop trend, sounds have become increasingly saturated, fragmented, and noisy. The excessive editing feel of 100 gecs and Dorian Electra is also a play on ““to what extent can we destroy pop?’’In a world created by AI, “destruction” has become a new form of creativity. Chapter 6: A new relationship between listeners and musical experienceToday”s listeners don”t “own” music. Rather, they would like to “share time. ”Subscription, live, SNS, short video. Music is not consumed as a “thing” but as a “moment in the flow”. Maturation of playlist cultureOn Spotify, ““mood-based playlists” have become mainstream, and it appears that ““music is becoming a part of the background. ”However, in reality, because it is a “background”, it is required to “resonate with the environment”. Listeners are looking for ““songs that change the atmosphere,” and artists are creating ““songs that design places. ” Redefining the album formatIt is also noteworthy that the album is being reconsidered as a “collection of stories. ”For example, Billie Eilish’s ““HIT ME HARD AND SOFT” (2024) prioritized ““a sinking experience throughout the work” rather than the virality of each song. The act of “listening to albums” has paradoxically become a luxurious way to spend time in the streaming era. Final chapter: Beyond where music has “lost its boundaries”Never before has music been so diverse, democratized, and diffused. AI helps compose music, nostalgia becomes the material for the future, and the global and local intersect. This change should not be viewed simply as ““chaos” but as ““the beginning of freedom. ”Music has always been a medium that connects people, time, and memories. What we need now is–    It’s not about who makes the sound, but why the sound is made.     It”s not about what genre it is, it”s about what kind of moment it creates.     How do we update the emotional resonance rather than technological evolution?  The music of 2025 is asking us all that question. And the answer is not AI or algorithms. It quietly exists in ““listening’’.

    "title": "[Column] Susumu Yokota — A universe in silence: A landscape of the soul drawn by electronic sounds",
    "body": "Chapter 1: Electronic music and Japan — Susumu Yokota’s positionText: mmr｜Theme: Susumu Yokota. A solitary artist who explores the soul of sound at the border between club culture and ambient. Tracing its tranquility and cosmic nature In the early 1990s, Japan’s electronic music scene was still in its infancy. While techno and house were becoming popular as imported culture, ambient music, which focused on “environmental sounds” and “silence,” was still a minority experimental genre. Susumu Yokota was a poet who lived in this quiet space. His music is an extension of club culture, yet somehow ““outside’’ it. He was a rare artist who used electronic particles to depict the breath of nature, the distance of the wind, and the reverberations of memories. Although Yokota started out in Tokyo’s club scene, he quickly transcended that context. His music focused more on “pause” than the “rhythm” of dance music, and moved toward pursuing the tranquility and organicity of electronic music. This is similar to the Japanese sense of ““wabi-sabi’’. Chapter 2: Susumu Yokota as a writer — Poetry of soundscapeYokota’s early works are heavily influenced by acid house. Acid Mt. Fuji (1994) was a groundbreaking work that fused natural sounds and acid synth. A paradoxical structure in which electronic music depicts “nature. ” There were already the seeds of later ambient ideas. His method is not just track making, but ““acoustic poetry. ’’ Reconstructing the sampled material and making minute loops float like air. It feels like the sound changes over time and eventually sinks into the depths of memory. That was his own view of music. What is noteworthy is that he published his works under multiple names. Among them, “Anima Mundi” was an important alias, and developed a more introspective and meditative sound. Under this name, he explores the metaphysical theme of “Anima Mundi” (the soul of the world) through a pure acoustic experience without rhythm. Chapter 3: Album Deconstruction — The Depths of a Great Album“Sakura” (1999)Susumu Yokota’s masterpiece and a monumental work in the history of ambient music. The faint melody and environmental sounds are layered, gently guiding the listener’s consciousness inward. It has a transience that captures the moment of falling cherry blossoms in the sound, and it is a fusion of Japanese lyricism and universal beauty. The album has an excellent structure, and the whole album flows like a single “breath”. It starts quietly, creating a faint rhythm and then disappearing. It’s like the cycle of life and seasons itself. The reason “Sakura” continues to be loved by ambient music fans around the world is probably because it perfectly depicts this “sense of time” through sound. “Symbol” (2001)Build your own sound image while making full use of classical music sampling. Baroque and Impressionist melodies dissolve into a sea of ​​electronics in Yokota’s hands. The entire work is like a ““reconstructed memory,” and as the title suggests, it is ““symbolic” music. “Grinning Cat” (2000)An album with a fairy-tale-like worldview, with comfortable, fantastic acoustics. There is a sense of playfulness that goes beyond the framework of mere ambient music. It has the power to make the listener imagine a story while changing the shape of the sound. “The Boy and the Tree” (2003)It has an atmosphere that feels like it was recorded in a forest, and a rhythm that makes you think of the heartbeat of life. Yokota’s unique “music of life” floating between nature and electronics. It has a high degree of perfection as a masterpiece of his later period. Chapter 4: Project under the name of Anima Mundi“Anima Mundi” means “soul of the world” in Latin. The series of works that Susumu Yokota developed under this name were truly worthy of that name. The songs focus on drones, ambient sounds, and harmonic structures, expanding the listener’s inner space. There is no beat or melody. There is only the ““sound that exists’’. For Yokota, this name could be said to be a ““channel that connects the unconscious and the universe. ’’If the music under the name Susumu Yokota is “earthly poetry,” Anima Mundi is “heavenly prayer. ” The 12-inch “Hebula” is a techno song that combines a dreamy, trippy sound with tribal rhythms and elements. This song features complex acoustic effects and multi-layered sound textures, transporting listeners to another world. TracklistA1. HebulaB1. FujinB2. SpringPurchase on Mercari YoutubeChapter 5: International reputation and impactIn the early 2000s, Susumu Yokota was highly acclaimed in the European and American ambient/electronica scenes. In particular, ““Sakura’’ boasted such a level of perfection that it was ranked alongside Boards of Canada, Fennesz, and Biosphere. Its beauty transcended genre boundaries and influenced post-classical and meditative music. It is also known that Aphex Twin and Four Tet supported his work. Overseas, he was described as ““Japan”s Brian Eno,’’ but Yokota”s music was actually more emotional and poetic. Chapter 6: Live and physicalityYokota’s live performance was not just a reenactment, but an attempt to “play out the space itself. ”He eliminated lighting and images as much as possible, transforming the space with the “density of air” that sound has. The audience is enveloped in particles of sound and loses their sense of time. It was an experience that felt like each person was melting into the sound. His stance was a rare example of combining the dance-like physicality of techno with the meditative nature of ambient. Chapter 7: Susumu Yokota’s music philosophyYokota’s musical philosophy, simply put, is ““finding life in sound. ’’For him, sound was not just a material, but a living entity. That”s why his works have no artificial coldness. Even though it”s an electronic sound, it has a warm, plant-like feel to it. His music is also a poetic exploration of time. Time does not feel like it is “flowing”, but rather “swaying”. In this flow, the listener forgets himself and becomes one with the sound. Chapter 8: Heritage and its continuation to the present dayWhen he passed away in 2015, many fans and musicians mourned his loss. However, his music still lives on quietly. New generations continue to be exposed to his sound through Bandcamp and reissues. His music transcends genres such as Ambient, Drone, and Minimal, and is being rediscovered as “listening meditation. ” Furthermore, Yokota’s spirit has certainly been inherited by contemporary ambient artists such as Chihei Hatakeyama and Hiroshi Ebina.

[Amazon]   Chapter 9: Conclusion — Music in silenceSusumu Yokota’s music is told not through flashy melodies and beats, but through silence and blank spaces. In that silence dwell the noise of the city, the breath of nature, and human memory. The music he left behind is not just a collection of works, but a mirror that reflects the inner self of the listener. Even after the sound disappears, something remains in your heart. That is the greatest “sound” that the musician Susumu Yokota left to the world. "

    "title": "[Column] Strings that directly convey emotions and thoughts — Guitarists from around the world and Japan",
    "body": "Prologue: The guitar, a “body recording device”Text: mmr｜Theme: Explaining the world”s and Japan”s leading guitarists from the perspective of era, genre, technique, and philosophy The guitar is more than just a musical instrument; in the history of music since the 20th century, it has functioned as an extension of the body that directly conveys emotions and ideas. The moment your fingers touch the strings, the sound is generated from the vibrations of your fingers and reaches the world through amplifiers and effectors. The tone produced by a guitar acts like a mirror, reflecting a person’s emotions, mental state, and even cultural background. The image of a guitarist is different between Japan and the world. In the United States and the United Kingdom, blues and rock have become the foundation, and the genre has evolved into a mainstream one. However, Japan has experienced a more complex and free-flowing development, from the postwar electric boom to underground noise, improvisation, and post-rock. The uniqueness of Japanese guitars emerges at the intersection of mainstream technique and underground destructive expression. II. World Edition: The moment when the guitar started a revolution1. Rock flashpoint (1950s-60s)Chuck Berry built the backbone of rock”n”roll through the fusion of rhythm guitar and phrases. The cutting with his right hand forms the basis of a dance beat, while the phrases with his left hand draw a unique melody even though they are derived from blues. Berry’s music showed that the electric guitar could become a symbol of youthful rebellion and freedom. Jimi Hendrix exploded the potential of the electric guitar. He made full use of effects such as feedback, wah pedal, and phaser to make the guitar sound like a “voice. ” In his live performances, he combines improvisation and subversive expression, transforming the guitar from just an accompaniment instrument to a central expressive device. Lou Reed (The Velvet Underground) uses simple chord progressions and dissonance to bring artistic subversiveness to his music. It was pop, yet provocative, and contained an underground spirit. 2. Experimental and rebellious guitarism (1970s-80s)Robert Fripp (King Crimson) established an innovative approach to progressive rock, using complex rhythms and improvised layers. Thurston Moore &amp; Lee Ranaldo (Sonic Youth) actively incorporate serendipity into their work, using specially tuned and prepared guitars. Using noise as a means of expression, he showed that the guitar is a tool for depicting not only melodies and chords, but also space and emotion. Glenn Branca has assembled a guitar orchestra that allows for the expression of urban acoustics. The layered structure of harmony and noise created by multiple guitar players had a major influence on later shoegaze and noise rock. Fred Frith emphasizes contingency in improvisation and maximizes the physical possibilities of the guitar. By manipulating the pick, strings, and body in a variety of ways, he created expressions that went beyond traditional techniques. 3. Between silence and roar (1990s-2000s)Kevin Shields (My Bloody Valentine) is a representative of shoegaze using a roaring wall. He created a new style that spatializes sound through feedback and modulation and expresses emotion through the “texture” of sound. David Pajo (Slint/Papa ​​M) is a pioneer of post-rock that structures silence. The combination of delicate arpeggios and rhythms creates a contrast between stillness and movement, creating a narrative sound world. Jim O”Rourke fuses experimental sounds and melody to develop guitar work that crosses genres. This made it possible to achieve both acoustics and singing spirit. Godspeed You! Black Emperor treats the guitar as a tool for epic poetry, painting urban and social landscapes with long songs. 4. Modern border crossers (2010-2020s)Mary Halvorson fuses jazz improvisation and abstract expression, turning the impossible with the guitar into the possible. He is a bridge between modern jazz and avant-garde. Ryley Walker introduces spiritual variations to modern folk, fusing blues, jazz, and rock. The guitar is a vehicle for storytelling and a mirror for emotional complexity. Yves Tumor traverses noise, pop, and physical expression. The guitar is treated like a voice or sound effect, and becomes a medium of expression that transcends the framework of an instrument. Ichika Nito / Yvette Young is a technical expert from the SNS generation. With complex polyrhythms, tapping, and harmony construction, he has revolutionized guitar technique in the digital age. III. Japan: Silence and Roaring History of Guitarists1. After the war and the dawn of electric power (1950s to 1970s)Takeshi Terauchi led the electric boom in postwar Japan. He conveyed the appeal of the guitar to young people with his technical and entertaining performances. Char translates the blues into Japanese and expands the guitar expression in Japanese music culture. His unique melody and technique earned him acclaim both domestically and internationally. Masayoshi Takanaka has given Japanese guitar music a unique color by fusing fusion and tropical mellow. It is characterized by a fusion of technique and emotion. 2. Underground movement (1970s-80s)Takashi Mizutani (Les Rallizes Dénudés) had a huge influence on the Japanese noise/underground scene with his decadent guitar noise and psychedelic performances. Seiichi Yamamoto (Boredoms / Omoide Hatoba):  Boredoms period: Ritual performance of rhythm and destruction. A fusion of noise, improvisation, and psychedelic.  Solo~Omoide Hatoba period: Introspective melody and psychedelic expression. Realizing the coexistence of singing spirit and noise.  He embodies the unconscious expression hidden in Japanese rock, and his influence on subsequent guitarists is immeasurable. Keiji Haino:  The ultimate physical guitarist: Simultaneously manipulate the guitar, voice, and body to create an extreme sound world through improvisation.  Techniques: Integrates all physical expressions such as picking, sliding, bow playing, resonant object manipulation, bass shouts, strange voices, whistling, etc.  Ideology: Music is an extension of the body, and the guitar is a mirror of emotion and spirit. Sublimating the destructive tone as an emotional expression.  Major Works: “Live at Improvised Music from Japan” series: Records of extreme improvised performances Live performance with MERZBOW: Dialogue between noise and physical expression Collaboration with Seiichi Yamamoto: Improvisation where introspection and destruction intertwine Live Features: Long improvisation lasting several hours Performance using the whole body (strings, body, voice) Experiential performance that appeals not only to hearing, but also to spatial and physical sensations Influence: Leaves a huge footprint on the entire Japanese underground scene and becomes a spiritual beacon for subsequent guitarists and experimental musicians. MERZBOW (Masami Akita) pursues the pure form of noise. Using guitars and electronic equipment, he develops extreme expression. 3. Post-rock and lyrical architecture (1990s-2000s)MONO is a post-rock band that depicts light and prayer with the guitar. It is characterized by its long song structure and lyrical arpeggios. toe explores the guitar as a rhythmic structure. Balancing mathematical precision and emotional expression. envy has established a unique emotional expression by fusing passionate hardcore with lyrical guitar work. Boris has gained international acclaim for their roaring sound and fusion of various genres. Zeni Geva fuses metal and noise to create destructive improvisational expressions. 4. The new generation of solitary (2010-2020s)Ichika Nito is a skilled artist from the SNS generation, making full use of polyrhythm, tapping, and harmony building. Disseminated to the world through YouTube. Ichiko Aoba uses an acoustic guitar to express dreamlike folk tales. Tabito Nanao fuses guitar and lyrics to develop modern poetic musical expressions. Influences after Seiichi Yamamoto: A young guitarist appears who inherits the introverted, improvisational, and underground expressions. IV. Redefining the guitar: device, body, prayerThe guitar is not just a musical instrument, but a device for self-expression.  Pedal board philosophy: Sound creation = ego design. Each pedal becomes an extension of the player’s personality.  Loop/Glitch/DAW: Extended “finger memory”. A single performer can perform orchestral expression.  Seiichi Yamamoto x Jim O”Rourke: Bridging the Kyoto underground to the world. Influenced improvisational and experimental music both domestically and internationally. Keiji Haino treats the guitar as an extension of his body and mind, and is a presence that shakes the listener’s senses with the extremes of sound. The trinity of improvisation, destruction, and expression becomes an important coordinate in the history of Japanese underground guitar. V. Conclusion: The lingering sound of the strings that never stops ringingThe guitar has always been a symbol of free expression, from the underground to the world. The era has come when the ““temperature and ideology of the performer’’ is more important than the technique.  The trembling of guitar strings continues to resonate throughout the ages.

    "body": "The heartbeat of the world and Japan: Rhythms that connect the aboveground and underground — between silence and impulse, tradition and experimentation —Text: mmr｜Theme: The genealogy of “rhythm” that runs through the world and Japan ─ ​​200 years of history of drummers who connect the aboveground and underground In the shadows of the drummers who were at the center of history, there are underground experimenters who were ahead of their time. Even in the days when Buddy Rich and John Bonham dominated the main stage, another heartbeat was beating somewhere in a warehouse or small jazz bar. They were often too excessive, too free, and difficult to understand. However, a new rhythm was born from that “blank space”. Underground drummers were playing time rather than instruments. It was neither a nation nor a genre, but the language of a ““sensory community. ’’ Introduction: What is rhythm? A cultural history of blowing and breathingPercussion instruments are the beginning of music and the heartbeat of the world. The drums in African villages are a substitute for words, and the Latin American congas are a continuation of prayer. And in cities after the Industrial Revolution, it became synchronized with the rhythm of machines. The drum set was born in the early 20th century. The combination of snare, kick, and hi-hat was designed as an extension of human limbs,Jazz turned it into an “improvisational structure. ” Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, Art Blakey──What they struck was not so much the rhythm, but the very existence. Rhythm is neither the dominant nor the accompaniment, but the “heartbeat” of the band community. The drummer who played it was also a philosopher. Chapter 1: The Heartbeat of the World — Genealogy of the Rhythm Revolution1-1. The Golden Age of Jazz: From Art Blakey to Elvin JonesAs symbolized by Art Blakey’s ““Moanin’’,During the golden age of jazz, drums were at the center of “dialogue. ”Blakey, the leader, nurtures young people through drumming. Elvin Jones became Coltrane’s “cosmic driving force. ”Rhythm was not just a groove, but an expansion of time and space. 1-2. Rock Explosion: Ginger Baker and John BonhamIn the 1960s and 1970s, drums transformed into a symbol of rebellion. Ginger Baker (Cream) introduced Afro-polirhythm to rock;John Bonham (Led Zeppelin) made the “drum solo” an art with his explosive sound pressure. The snare reverb in Bonham’s “When the Levee Breaks” isIt also became the prototype for subsequent hip-hop beats. 1-3. Orthodox axis: Buddy Rich, Tony Williams, Steve GaddBuddy Rich is a symbol of speed, Tony Williams is a symbol of freedom, and Steve Gadd is a symbol of precision. The “ideal image of a drummer” they created was the very framework of 20th century music. However, at the same time, drums that deviate from discipline were writhing underground. 1-4. The heartbeat of Africa: Tony Allen and the political revolutionTony Allen, better known as Fela Kuti’s sidekick, is the man who invented “Afrobeat. ”The rhythm was a symbol of “anti-establishment” and visualized the energy of the people in Nigeria under military rule. The drums were politics. The sound was a protest. 1-5. Impact of the European avant-garde: Han Bennink, Christian LillingerHan Bennink from the Netherlands bangs on chairs and walls on stage. For him, ““sound’’ is an encounter with an object itself. Germany’s Christian Lillinger manipulates polyrhythms like data structures to connect contemporary music and club culture. European experimental drummers have criticized rhythm as a “philosophy. ” 1-6. Underground North America: Greg Fox, Deantoni ParksGreg Fox (ex-Liturgy) is a fusion of black metal and improvisation. Deantoni Parks (The Mars Volta) plays the sampler with one hand and the snare with the other. Use your body to solve the 21st century challenge of ““coexistence of humans and machines. ’’Their performance lies somewhere between religious ritual and technology. Chapter 2: The heartbeat of Japan — Rhythms that connect above and below ground2-1. After Ponta — From craftsman to thinkerWhat Shuichi Murakami “Ponta” created was the sense of “tapping in Japanese. ”However, since the 1990s, a new generation has emerged who dismantled that grammar. They redefined the gravity of music by “shifting the gaps”. 2-2. YOSHIMIO (BOREDOMS / OOIOO) and Yo2ro — Release the drum into spaceYoshimi Yokota = YOSHIMIO is one of the most free drummers in the world. Boredoms’ giant drum ensemble ““77BOADRUM’’ was a ritual that shook the city. For her, drums are not just a percussion instrument, but the “waves of life. ” Additionally, Yo2ro is active in Boredoms and other experimental music projects. By freely manipulating the vertical and horizontal aspects of polyrhythm, he echoes YOSHIMIO’s cosmic beat. Yo2ro’s snare has the power to transform space every time it is struck. He is attracting attention as a symbol of Japan’s avant-garde drummers. 2-3. Rock rebels after Yuya Uchida: Tatsuya Nakamura, Junji IkebataTatsuya Nakamura has turned the drum into something that is both violence and poetry. Beyond the context of “Kiyoshiro Imawano” and “Blankey Jet City,”A being that embodies the body’s cries as sound. Junji Ikebata plays the drums that translate blues into Japanese. The stick has the Showa style and rebelliousness. 2-4. Experiment and meditation: Tatsuhisa Yamamoto, Yasuhiro Yoshigaki, Hachito Matsumoto, Keiji HainoTatsuhisa Yamamoto (Akira Sakata, co-starring Jim O’Rourke) makes a sound that sounds like hitting the very air. Its rhythm visualizes the moment when time stops. Yasuhiro Yoshigaki (ROVO, Orquesta Nudge! Nudge!) integrates club music structures and improvisation. Hachito Matsumoto (ex-Paellas) brings out the urban feel of the post-indie era. Keiji Haino’s strikes transcend the boundaries of noise, improvisation, and prayer. The theme of both works is “impulse in silence. ” 2-5. New generation flow: Shun Ishiwaka, Utena Kobayashi, Akira Sakamoto, Yo2roShun Ishiwaka is a symbol of Tokyo J-Jazz, but he also freely traverses pop fields such as millennium parade and cero. Utena Kobayashi (black midi-like polyrhythm + Japanese drum-like structure) transcends gender and genre. Akira Sakamoto (DOWNY, MONO NO AWARE) treads the line between tranquility and violence. And Yo2ro, based on the experience cultivated in contemporary music and improvisational projects including Boredoms,The intersection of traditional rhythm and avant-garde improvisation resonates in modern cities. They are reconstructing the ““individual rhythm’’ = the grammar of the world. Chapter 3: The future of rhythm — a new relationship between machines and bodiesAI drums, MIDI triggers, and haptic devices. The future of percussion instruments is also an attempt to redefine human physicality. However, no matter how much technology advances,The origin of rhythm is “breath” and “heartbeat. ” As Jeff Mills says,“Drum machines are the future of jazz. ”At his live shows, the TR-909 sounds like a living thing. And as Keiji Haino continues,“Silence is part of music. ” Final Chapter: Genealogy of Heartbeats — A rhythm that runs through the world and JapanThe heartbeat of the world and the heartbeat of Japan are definitely intersecting right now. A loft in New York, a warehouse in Berlin, a basement studio in Tokyo. Drums continue to beat like a heartbeat everywhere. Art Blakey’s “Soul Beat”John Bonham’s “Explosive Poem”Keiji Haino’s “Silent Explosion”Tatsuhisa Yamamoto’s “Sound of Breathing”,YOSHIMIO and Yo2ro’s cosmic beat. At first glance, they seem like different worlds. However, the rhythm that dwells in the hearts of listeners is the same. It is “the heartbeat that connects the aboveground and underground”──And it is a musical memory that will last into the future.

    "title": "[Column] Planet of Bass: Cultural History of Bassists in the World and Japan ---Sounds Under the Earth's Surface",
    "body": "“The soul of music is in the bass. ”Text: mmr｜Theme: “Bass philosophy” that permeates the world and Japanese bassist culture We are often captivated by melodies. However, the moment when we “feel” music is always in the bass tones resonating deep within our bodies. When the subwoofer in a club shakes the air, or when a hit hits your chest at a live house,At the center of this is an invisible gravity called the “base. ” I. Listening to music with your body, not your earsBass is a sound that your body reacts to before you hear it. He stands between rhythm and harmony, and determines the center of gravity of music. It is not just an accompaniment, but controls the very breath of the music. Since the 20th century, changes in music have always accompanied innovations in bass. Jazz gives you the freedom to improvise, rock gives off a rebellious energy,Every time techno or hip-hop etched the urban atmosphere, bass presented a “new physicality. ” II. Crustal changes in the world: History of 20th century music driven by bass sounds1. Starting with the rebellion of jazzListening to Charles Mingus playIt sounds more than just a bass line, it sounds like a statement to society. Anger and intelligence, improvisation and construction. There is poetry in that bass tone. Players like Ray Brown and Ron CarterHe brought philosophy to the “walking baseline. ”Rhythm that speaks between sounds - this is what has elevated jazz to an art form. Yoshio Suzuki and Kunimitsu Inaba, who supported postwar jazz cafes in Japan,Enjoying this “freedom of bass sounds” with the sensibilities of our own country,Before long, they were creating their own unique groove at night in Tokyo. 2. Rock revolution: singing bass and screaming bassIn the 1960s, bass appeared at the center of rock. Paul McCartney started a revolution as a melodious bassist,John Entwistle (The Who) sought architectural beauty amidst the roar. Jack Bruce (Cream) and John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin)Although he has blues roots, he constructed the ensemble architecturally. After that, rock music no longer lacked the “singing spirit” of the bass. The advent of punk unleashed the harshness of the bass. Sid Vicious (Sex Pistols) rejected artifice and sounded rebellion with his very existence. And the sad melody played by Joy Division’s Peter Hook,It has been proven that the bass can be the ““subject of emotion. ’’ 3. Funk and experimentation: an era where bass came to the foreThe moment when Larry Graham’s slap playing style was born,The bass became the rhythm itself. Bootsy Collins’ cosmic funk,A fretless poem by Jaco Pastorius. The bass is no longer an “accompaniment”, but has evolved into a “narrator”. Mick Carn and Tony Levin treat the sound itself as if it were a sculpture,He pushed bass into the realm of abstract art. III. Bass map of Japan: Bassists who move between above ground and underground1. Haruomi Hosono and translators of Japanese rhythmBefore YMO, Haruomi Hosono had already changed the ““center of gravity’’ of Japanese pop music. A low tone that follows the rhythm of the words rather than the rhythm of English. What he established was the aesthetic of ““grooving in Japanese. ’’ Hironori Ito of Tatsuro Yamashita Band, Tsugutoshi Goto, Akira Okazawa──They have created a world-class sound between popular songs and AOR. The bass guitar no longer played a role behind the scenes, but became an element that supported the “dignity” of music. 2. Underground movement: noise, post-rock, club cultureAfter the 1990s, the Japanese underground began to connect with bass sounds. Kentaro Nakao of NUMBER GIRL hits a groove of distortion and anger,Ichiro Yoshida of ZAZEN BOYS has elevated odd time signatures into “building intelligence. ” The bassists of ROVO and Shibusa Shirazu,Freely moving between jazz and rock, improvisation and construction,It blurred the line between club culture and live music. The delicate bass sounds of downy and toe sounds like a poem depicting a city night. There is not a scream, but a ““breathing stillness. ’’ 3. Bass philosophy after club cultureIn the 2000s, the bass changed its appearance once again. Shinichi Osawa brings “human bass” to club tracks,STUTS and yahyel combined typing and live music. Current bands like King Gnu and millennium parade,The bass controls the ““narrative’’ of the song. Hama Okamoto is a nexus of tradition and modernity. It offers “musical civility” beyond playability. IV. Underground of the world: Counterculture connected by bass soundsJoy Division”s Peter Hook, PIL”s Jah Wobble,and Tina Weymouth from Talking Heads. What they showed was that the bass was a symbol of “intellectual rebellion. ” In Bristol, Massive Attack and Portishead established trip-hop,In London, Burial and Kode9 redefined the bass as an “unconscious urban sound. ”In Berlin, Moritz von Oswald and Electric Indigo,He elevated the bass sound of techno to the level of “architectural art. ” The bass is no longer a musical instrument,It has become a “common language of culture. ” V. Equipment and Aesthetics: Another History of InstrumentsFender Precision, Jazz Bass, Rickenbacker. Each shape indicates a difference in musical thought itself. The evolution of synth basses also democratized bass sounds. Moog, Roland, Novation—machines have feelings,The baseline changed from “program” to “personality. ” After Jaco, Fretless became something like a silent poet. It has been passed down as a “sound sculpture” that makes the space itself resonate. VI. Conclusion: Bass is “society”s subconscious”The bass is not the center of music. However, it continues to be the “ground” upon which all sounds stand. The bass translates feelings that cannot be put into words,Slowly shaking society’s unconscious mind. On that line that passes through the world and Japan, above ground and underground,We are still standing today. Listen with your heart, not your ears. The planet of bass has not stopped ringing yet.

    "title": "[Column] Four Germanys, four technos — wall reverberations and minimalist philosophy",
    "body": "Prologue It all started on the night the Berlin Wall fell      Text: mmr   Theme: If you look at Germany by dividing it into four metropolitan areas, you will see that techno is not just music, but a ““cultural map’’ that echoes memories of geography and history.    November 1989. On the other side of the crumbling concrete, someone brought out a speaker and blasted a beat. At that moment, the country of Germany began rhythmic reconstruction before ““reunification. ’’Abandoned factories, empty warehouses, underground tunnels—the sounds flowing there are not copies of the British and American sounds. “Made after the Wall”. It was not music for crossing borders, but music that was born on the site of the border. Chapter 1 Berlin: From ruins to clubs - the capital of “post-Detroit”1-1. A kick echoed at the ruins of the wallTresor, E-Werk, and later the global icon Berghain. Berlin’s techno was both an admiration for Detroit and an urban renewal project. The rigid rhythms of Jeff Mills and Underground Resistance became a voice for freedom in a city still under the shadow of socialism.  “In this town, sound is politics. ”— Dimitri Hegemann (Founder of Tresor) 1-2. The birth of minimalism and the “aesthetics of construction”Basic Channel, Chain Reaction, Raster-Noton. Shape the sound, build it, and dominate the space. Berlin minimalism, which looks at the richness of “nothing,” resonates with the ideas of architecture and design. Acoustics will not be the walls, but the air structure. 1-3. How Berlin became the techno capital of the worldIn the late 1990s, artists from all over the world moved to this city. Richie Hawtin, Ellen Allien, Ben Klock. Berlin has become a republic of sounds rather than a nation. A city where techno is a profession, a life, and a religion. As long as the sound continues, this city will never sleep. Chapter 2 Düsseldorf-Cologne: Electronic sound laboratory2-1. The shadow and successors of KraftwerkAnother DNA flows in the Rhine River basin. This is the idea of ​​”“harmony between humans and machines’’ created by Kraftwerk. NEU!, La Düsseldorf, Cluster—’70s electro experiments laid the groundwork for later techno. 2-2. Kompakt and the genealogy of minimal popIn the 1990s, the Kompakt label, which emerged from Cologne, presented a ““soft techno’’ that was different from the rigidity of Berlin. Wolfgang Voigt’s Gas depicts low frequencies floating in a foggy forest. It was the moment when minimalism acquired emotion and poetry.  “For me, techno is a landscape painting. ”— Wolfgang Voigt 2-3. Rhine River Electronic Music Culture AreaKöln doesn’t differentiate between clubs and museums. Electronic sounds are “culture” itself, the breathing rhythm of city life. There is an extension of German Romanticism, where reason and dream coexist. Chapter 3 Frankfurt: The melting pot of industrial and rave3-1. “Sound of Frankfurt” explosionIf Berlin is philosophy, Frankfurt is festival. Sven Väth, Eye Q, Harthouse—this is where the ““rave”’ craze was born in the early “90s. A metallic trance beat lights up the night of an industrial city. 3-2. Urban and industrial grooveFinance and labor, warehouses and chimneys. The techno in this city is the machine breathing of an industrial area. The sound pressure in the basement of the Dorian Gray club was both a social reaction and a catharsis. 3-3. Where did Frankfurt’s genes go?Cocoon, Ibiza, festival culture. The origin of all this lies in the Frankfurt rave of the 1990s. Europe before EDM started here. Techno was a prayer, another heartbeat beating behind the economy. Chapter 4 Hamburg-Leipzig: Resistance from the frontier4-1. Hamburg, the experimental city of the northDial Records, Pantha du Prince, Lawrence. Northern techno is full of solitude and poetry. An introspective melancholy, the opposite of the glittering Berlin. Not ““music for dancing” but ““beats for thinking. ” 4-2. Local scene in eastern LeipzigThe DIY spirit that has continued since the East German era is alive and well in the basement of this city. Turning an abandoned building into a club and producing sound using a homemade system. What exists there is techno as a community, unrelated to commercialization. For them, music is both political and everyday. 4-3. Significance of “non-centered techno”It’s easy to deify Berlin. But the true diversity of German techno lies in the resistance of the periphery. The slowness of time and the analog feel of the countryside. This reflects the future sound of techno. Chapter 5 Rhythm map connecting the four Germanys5-1. German techno as “multipolarization” rather than “unification”In the 21st century, techno is no longer a singular urban culture. The functional beauty of Berlin, the poetry of Cologne, the enthusiasm of Frankfurt, the community of Leipzig. Each rhythm intersects, creating a multipolar sonic map of Germany. 5-2. The future of German minimalismA return to hardware and a rediscovery of modular synths. It”s not just nostalgia, it”s a return to hand-based techno. German techno continues to tune cities and bodies. Final chapter “Country” in an infinite loopTechno is a ““national rhythmic characteristic’’ that remains after crossing national borders. More than 30 years have passed since the Berlin Wall fell. Germany became a country unified by sound, not politics. And his heart is still beating at a 4/4 beat.

    "title": "[Column] Border Community — A community of sound that transcends boundaries",
    "body": "I. Prologue: A story that begins at the borderText: mmr｜Theme: Tracing the music philosophy of “Border Community” established by James Holden and the trajectory of the label that transcends that “boundary” The name Border Community is more than just a label. It was a statement of ““a community connected through music” and a desire to ““transcend existing genres and commercial structures. ” In the early 2000s, the club scene was in the midst of major changes. Trance was formalizing and progressive house was becoming rigid. In it, James Holden was exploring sounds that move back and forth between melody and noise, analog and digital, intelligence and emotion. “Border Community” was born as his “border laboratory. ” II. Landscape of 2001: Dawn of Post-ProgressiveIn 2001, Holden gained attention with the song “A Break in the Clouds” released on Silver Planet. Their sound broke the mold of progressive house at the time. Melancholic yet architectural. The floating melodies turned club nights into a poetic experience. Starting with this song, he carves out a sound that is neither trance nor house. This flow later crystallized in the form of Border Community. III. Establishment of Border Community: Chain of DIY spirit and resonanceIn 2003, Holden launched his own label, Border Community. In opposition to commercial club music, it advocated a DIY spirit in which artists present, design, and talk about their own works. Nathan Fake’s first release, ““The Sky Was Pink,’’ marked a turning point in club music history. The emotional and introspective tracks influenced subsequent post-club generations such as Four Tet and Caribou. The artwork and release design were also unique. Illustrations with soft brush strokes, minimalist design based on white. Like sound, Border Community’s worldview was aimed at “visualizing emotions. ” IV. Soundscape: The birth of melancholic technoWhat characterized this label was ““techno with emotion. ’’The beat is deep, the melody is broken, yet somehow beautiful. Holden”s philosophy is clear: “Melody is beautiful even when it”s broken. ” The analog distortion of synthesizers, the roughness of tape, and the fragments of digital. The ““emotional sound’’ created by mixing these elements lies at the core of Border Community. Between ambient and trance, between club and introspection—music that doesn’t belong anywhere. V. Major artists: a group of resonant sounds Nathan Fake — Between nostalgia and chaos. His masterpiece “Drowning in a Sea of ​​Love” is a monumental work of analog electronica.  Petar Dundov — A fusion of architectural beauty and trance sensations. Coexistence of mathematical precision and emotion.  Luke Abbott — An idyllic future of modular synths. “Holkham Drones” depicts the symbiosis between nature and electrons.  The MFA, Avus, Ricardo Tobar — Leaders of the “Border aesthetic” that spread from local to global. What they all have in common is an attitude that focuses on the ““emotion of sound’’ rather than genre. It embodies the ““music = thinking process’’ that Holden sought. VI. Expanding boundaries: the evolution and proliferation of labelsIn 2013, Holden released The Inheritors. This was a new chapter for Border Community, and at the same time an event in music history. The sound that fuses synthesizer improvisation, folk rhythms, and analog noise brings electronic music back to something ““lifelike. ’’ After that, he transitioned to a live band formation, and his sound became even more free. Border Community may have receded from the mainstream, but its influence has continued to be passed down to the likes of Jon Hopkins, Floating Points, and Four Tet. VII. “Border” as aesthetics: reverberations of sound and thought ”Border’’ is not a boundary between genres, but a boundary between ideas. For Holden, music was a response to society and a question to the world. As club culture became commercialized, Border Community became a base for regaining ““emotions” and ““autonomy. ”Sound is not nostalgia, but the reconstruction of memory. It has the power to make listeners reconsider their own boundaries. VIII. Final chapter: Disappeared boundaries, continuing communityBorder Community’s activities are currently quiet. But that spirit lives on in many artists. “Community” refers to the relationships created by the music itself. What Holden envisioned was not a closed label, but an open space of resonance. The journey of sound that transcends boundaries is not over yet.

    "title": "[Column] Synthpop: The era of electronic dreams",
    "body": "When did electronic sounds become “human voices”?Text: mmr｜Theme: A full-length cultural theory that traces the “future nostalgia” of synth pop, from YMO to Charli XCX Pop music seemed to take on a new lease of life when synthesizers became more than mechanical sounds and began to play with emotion. Synthpop, which was born in the late 1970s as technology evolved, continues to give us a cold yet beautiful feeling of “nostalgia for the future. ” Chapter 1 The moment electronic music became “pop”In the 1970s, synthesizers from Moog, ARP, and Japanese manufacturers like Roland and Yamaha democratized music production. Electronic sound, which until then had been the preserve of gigantic studio equipment, gradually found its way into homes and live music venues. Kraftwerk’s “The Robots” is inorganic, as if questioning the boundaries between humans and machines, yet resonates with a strange sense of humor. The vision they presented of ““man = machine’’ became the concept that underpinned all subsequent pop music. Gary Numan, Human League, and Depeche Mode carried on that spirit. They replaced rock’s passion with synths and turned cold urban melancholy into beats. This was a time when the word “future” still contained both hope and fear; it was a pre-digital dream that sounded inside analog circuits. Chapter 2 UK edition: Dawn of the New RomanticIn the early 1980s, young people dressed in eccentric makeup and fashion gathered at London’s Blitz club. They were dubbed the “Blitz Kids” and created new icons like Visage, Spandau Ballet, and Duran Duran. What was playing here was the sound of ““New Romantic’’ wrapped in electronic sparkle. Gary Numan’s Cars became an anthem of urban loneliness, and Depeche Mode portrayed the frustrations of youth with the inorganic sounds of industrial areas. Meanwhile, New Order transcends Joy Division’s tragedy and heads to the dance floor, fusing the electronic and the physical with “Blue Monday. ”Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys said, ““Synths are masks to hide your emotions. ’’Synthpop was truly the ““aesthetics of loneliness’’ of the 1980s. Chapter 3 US edition: Electro-pop and MTV dizzinessIn America, Donna Summer and producer Giorgio Moroder’s 1977 hit ““I Feel Love’’ was a decisive turning point. Introducing a full electronic beat to the disco rhythm, the song transported the dance floor into the future. Prince continued this trend and created a fusion of funk and synth called the Minneapolis sound. Although his music is sexual, he finds a real groove in the electronic sounds. The arrival of MTV also spurred the spread of synthpop. Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson—visuals and sounds became increasingly integrated, and electronic sounds began to be consumed as a “style. ”This was the moment when Kraftwerk’s ideas were reflected in the gorgeous mirror of American pop culture. Chapter 4 Japan: Birth and maturity of techno-popAt that time, a quiet revolution was beginning in Tokyo. The sound produced by YMO (Yellow Magic Orchestra) in 1978 was not just an imitation, but a reimagining of electronic music into an “Asian context. ”Ryuichi Sakamoto”s music theory, Haruomi Hosono”s pop sensibilities, and Yukihiro Takahashi”s sense of rhythm: YMO”s sound was the first ““electronic voice’’ released to the world by Japan in the early days of globalization. Ryuichi Sakamoto later said:  “Technology is a way to make music more human. ” When Perfume and Yasutaka Nakata arrived on the scene in the 2000s, that philosophy was revived in a new form. The voice was artificial due to auto-tune and sequencing, but it certainly had the ““feelings of the digital age’’ in it. They symbolized an era when ““being mechanical” became ““cute. ” Cornelius, Denki Groove, and tofubeats also diversified techno-pop, combining local sentiment with global beats. Japanese synth pop has matured as a “translation” rather than a mere imitation. Chapter 5 Resonance of the world: Where Japanese electronic sounds have crossed overYMO’s impact spread across the ocean to many artists. Daft Punk praised Ryuichi Sakamoto’s sound design in interviews, and their sense of melody is clearly influenced by Japanese minimalism. Radiohead”s ““Kid A” is an introspective development of YMO”s idea of ​​”“depicting emotions with electronic sounds. ”“Everything in Its Right Place” is cold and beautiful, as if the ghosts of “BGM” and “Technodelic” have come back to life. The “neo-synthpop” generation, including Grimes, Charli XCX, and SOPHIE, was also strongly influenced by Japanese pop sensibilities. Their sounds express a 21st century electronic body while absorbing the worldview of anime, games, and vocaloids. “Kawaii” is no longer a Japanese word, but a global word. Behind this is a continuous technological aesthetic from YMO to Perfume. Chapter 6 Technology and Emotions: When Machines Depict HumansSequencer, sampler, autotune. These were not tools for ““accuracy,” but brushes used to highlight ““human ambiguity. ”Something mechanical can be emotional—that’s the paradoxical charm of synthpop. In the 21st century, ““the aesthetics of imperfection’’ is being reevaluated. Grimes” voice wavering, Charli XCX”s AI vocal processing, and Yaeji’s blend of native languages. All of these prove that ““imperfect sounds’’ convey humanity. As AI composition advances, the “human artificiality” of synthpop may be the last romanticism in music. Chapter 7 Recommended playlist (age group guide)1970s: Dawn and Experiment Kraftwerk “The Robots” YMO “Rydeen” Gary Numan “Cars”1980s: Golden Age and Visual Culture Depeche Mode “Enjoy the Silence”-Pet Shop Boys “West End Girls” Madonna “Lucky Star”1990s: Reconstruction and the dawn of electro Björk “Hyperballad” Cornelius “Point” Daft Punk “Digital Love”2000s-2010s: Dawn of neo-synthpop Perfume “Polyrhythm” CHVRCHES “The Mother We Share” Grimes “Oblivion” Charli XCX “Vroom Vroom”2020s: Post-AI pop era Caroline Polachek “Bunny Is a Rider” Yaeji “For Granted” A. G. Cook “Beautiful”Chapter 8 Conclusion: “Nostalgia of the future” told by electronic soundsSynthpop is both the “sound of the future” and the “sound of nostalgia for the past. ”Why are we so moved by the cold electronic sounds of the 1980s? That’s because they contain the ““temperature of a time when people believed in the future. ’’Even now, as digital technology advances and AI begins to compose music, humans continue to search for ““self’’ in the sounds of machines. The ““relationship between technology and emotion’’ that Ryuichi Sakamoto continued to ask until the end is now once again a front-line theme. And somewhere in that lineage lies YMO”s electronic smile, Perfume”s polyrhythms, and Charli XCX’s pixelated tears. The future is always ringing in electronic dreams.

How has Japanese synth pop influenced overseas? **A3. The experimental spirit of YMO and Ryuichi Sakamoto influenced Daft Punk and Radiohead, and became the origin of “electronic humanity” in the AI ​​era.  **Q4. What are the characteristics of neo-synthpop in recent years? **A4. The point is that we actively incorporate “digital distortion” such as hyper pop and AI music. Charli XCX and Grimes are examples of this.  **Q5. What introductory album would you recommend for beginners? **A5. “Solid State Survivor” (YMO) and “Violator” (Depeche Mode) are must-listens regardless of time and country. lastlyTracing the history of electronic sound is also tracing the record of human emotions. It”s a continuous “poetry of technology,” from YMO”s early experiments to Charli XCX’s digital sadness. Synthpop never ends. In fact, in the age of AI, the essence of this is being questioned once again. "

    "title": "[Column] The miracle of listening: the future of \"sound\" envisioned by the Hearing Health Foundation",
    "body": "Introduction: Poetics of the sense of hearing      Text: mmr   Theme: The ear is a small universe. Explore the mysteries and future of the act of “listening” through HHF’s activities that support hearing research, prevention, and regeneration.     “Silence is the most important part of music”— Miles Davis The ear is not just an organ for picking up sound. It is a “poetic device” for carrying memories and connecting with the world. Hearing Health Foundation (HHF) works to protect and restore this “ability to listen. ”As the largest hearing and balance research fund in the United States, they support everything from investigating the causes of hearing loss and tinnitus to the forefront of regenerative medicine and gene therapy. 1. The science of listening: the universe inside your ears “Sound makes the air tremble and the heart tremble. ”— Brian Eno Sound picked up by the outer ear vibrates the eardrum, passes through the auditory ossicles and reaches the cochlea. Hair cells in the inner ear convert these vibrations into electrical signals, which the brain recognizes as “sound. ”The HHF website provides an easy-to-understand explanation of the mechanisms of sensorineural hearing loss, Meniere’s disease, and hypersensitivity caused by breakdowns in this delicate system. Sound collected in the outer ear travels through the eardrum to the ossicles in the middle ear, and then to the cochlea in the inner ear. From there, it is converted into an electrical signal and sent to the brain stem and auditory cortex via the auditory nerve. Listening to sound is truly the “music of life,” involving everything from physical phenomena to neurological and cognitive processes. 2. Landscape of hearing impairment ─ Rhythm in silenceSinger Grimes continues to create music despite suffering from tinnitus. “There’s order even in the noise,” she says. Hearing loss may be a process of “reconstruction” rather than loss. HHF continues to support research into tinnitus and balance disorders. The scope of this research is not limited to simple medical research, but also extends to the field of neuroscience, which elucidates the interaction between hearing and the brain. 3. The science of regeneration – the dream of bringing back sound“The ear is a circuit, and music is an electric current. ”— Ryuichi Sakamoto The HHF-supported Hearing Restoration Project (HRP)Research on cell therapy and gene therapy to regenerate lost hair cells is progressing. This is an experiment in the future that will make the recovery of “listening” a reality. Technological innovations in cochlear implants and new hearing aids are also remarkable. From “amplifying sound” to “delivering it directly to the brain”. In the field of sound design, research on “auditory UI” using brain waves is accelerating. ▶︎ Diagram: Auditory signal pathway (from sound waves to auditory cortex)sequenceDiagramparticipant Sound as sound waves (air vibrations)Outer participant as outer earparticipant Middle as middle earInner participant as inner ear (cochlea)Hair participant as hair cellNerve as participantbrainstem as participant brainstem (superior olivary nucleus, etc. )Midbrain participant as Inferior colliculusparticipant Thalamus as thalamus (MGN)participant Cortex as auditory cortex (temporal lobe)Sound-&gt;&gt;Outer: Collect sound wavesOuter-&gt;&gt;Middle: Transmitted to the eardrumMiddle-&gt;&gt;Inner: Amplified by the auditory ossiclesInner-&gt;&gt;Hair: Organ of Corti converts vibrations into electrical signalsHair-&gt;&gt;Nerve: Nerve firingNerve-&gt;&gt;Brainstem: Primary signal reachedBrainstem-&gt;&gt;Midbrain: Sound source localizationMidbrain-&gt;&gt;Thalamus: Time-frequency analysisThalamus-&gt;&gt;Cortex: Recognize the meaning of soundsNote over Cortex: Higher-order processing linked to memory and emotionSimple versionflowchart LRSound waves --&gt;|Sound collection| EarEar --&gt;|Amplification| CochleaCochlea --&gt;|Transformation| Nerve signalsNeural signals --&gt;|Transmission| BrainBrain --&gt;|Cognition| Auditory experienceA diagram that follows the time series of sound waves from when they enter the ear until they are given meaning in the cerebral cortex. The brainstem, inferior colliculus, and thalamus (MGN) perform relay and preprocessing, and the information is finally recognized and interpreted in the auditory cortex. Attention, memory, and emotional circuits influence this process. This route is an “auditory journey. ”The physical tremors in the air eventually sublimate into “music” connected to emotions and memories. Research on the complex hierarchical structure is also applied to the design of speech recognition models for artificial intelligence. 4. Between Noise and Silence: A Cultural Theory of PreventionThe loud sounds of rock concerts, the excessive use of earphones, and the noise of the city. These can be called modern-day “aural pollution. ”HHF’s campaign #KeepListening is a social movement that reconsiders the relationship between volume and distance. In fact, David Bowie was very concerned about his ear health. During the tour, the stage monitor volume was set to half the normal volume. Protecting your hearing is also a form of “artistic self-care” that allows you to continue expressing yourself for a long time. 5. The fate of musicians and the ear: “Cultural history of hearing” interpreted through anecdotes Beethoven: Completed the Ninth in the despair of hearing loss.  Pete Townshend (The Who): Lost his hearing due to the loud noise of a live performance and started campaigning to raise awareness of hearing protection.  Phil Collins: Toured despite having hearing loss in one ear.  Radiohead’s Thom Yorke: Despite suffering from tinnitus, he sublimated his “inner sounds” into songs. These anecdotes show that music doesn’t end when your ears are damaged. HHF’s philosophy also provides scientific support for its spirit. 6. Society and support: a community that creates the future of the earHHF fosters cultural literacy in hearing health through donations, research grants, and education. For example, the Emerging Research Grants winners selected each year are:From gene editing to artificial intelligence, he depicts the “future of listening” from a variety of angles. In addition, in the online magazine for the general public, Hearing Health Magazine,It features actual experiences and columns from experts, and proposes ear health as a lifestyle. 7. Conclusion: The future of listening“Music is the art of listening, and listening is living. ”— John Cage The science of hearing is also the science of our sensibilities. The reproduction of sound may be the ““reproduction of human existence. ’’The Hearing Health Foundation’s activities transcend the boundaries between medicine and art. It quietly illuminates the future of the culture surrounding “listening. ” Reference links Hearing Health Foundation Official Website Hearing Health Magazine #KeepListening Campaign"

    "title": "[Column] Aesthetics of imperfection ─ A new aesthetic of pop living in an era of imperfection",
    "body": "Indie Sleaze brings back the era of dirty pleasureText: mmr｜Theme: Tiredness towards “perfect pop”. As a reaction to this, the “aesthetics of imperfection” is once again sweeping the world. Weary of the “perfect pop” created by the smartphone era. As a reaction to this, the ““aesthetics of imperfection”’ is once again sweeping the world. Charli XCX”s brat symbolized not just a trend, but a cultural rewilding. Pop culture has finally tired of the “too clean aesthetic”. Charli XCX’s album “brat” dominates the summer charts. When we breathed new life into clubs around the world,We were made aware again…I think music should be rougher, more improvised, and more “imperfect. ” 1. The rekindling of Indie Sleaze and the pleasure of “roughness”1-1. What lies behind Y2K nostalgiaIn the mid-2020s, the Y2K revival spread from fashion to music to internet culture. Among them, the term “Indie Sleaze” is once again in the spotlight. In the early 2000s, a party lit by digital camera flashes,Muses whose make-up is still ruined,An ambiguous romanticism that dwells in the image quality of MySpace. What was there was the truth because it was not in place. And in 2024, that “roughness” once again destroyed modern boredom. This attitude of rejecting perfect filters has become a new aesthetic. 1-2. Signs shown by fashionLaunched by Saint Laurent and Heaven by Marc JacobsThe “roughness of the night” and “worn out shine” areEventually, it infected the world of music as well. In the eerie decadence of the Balenciaga show,The “beauty of not being perfect” was stirring. Charli XCX’s ““brat’’ sublimated that feeling into pop music. 2. “Brat” talks about the power of “imperfection”2-1. Casual realityWhen you listen to “brat”, the first thing you feel is the comfort of being “unfinished. ”The vocals are rough, the mix is ​​staticy, and the lyrics are spit out impulsively. However, there is a “raw” feel to it that is not found in other pop music. It is a ““human touch’’ that is the opposite of the era of perfection. 2-2. The antithesis of a perfect worldSmartphones and social networking sites have created an obsession with always being right. Images are cleaned up, voices are corrected, and mistakes are instantly removed. However, Charli XCX seems to laugh off the pressure. He dared to throw out an uneven sound to the world. The success of ““brat’’ is a milestone in pop history. It symbolizes a “departure from the belief in perfection. ” 3. Ripples of imperfection ─ From Trashy to Organic3-1. Kesha and the “Joyride” parableKesha’s “Joyride” is a nod to 2000s Euro dance. I dared to revive it cheaply. Behind the sparkling synths, a rawness shines through, like a mix of sweat and makeup. It was a carnivalesque rebellion against the world of overly controlled beauty. Charli XCX and Kesha’s movements showed thatIt was the dawn of an era of ““openness’’ rather than perfection. 3-2. Lo-fi RenaissanceAt the bottom of club culture,DIY-style expressions using cheap microphones and used equipment are once again gaining popularity. In clubs in Berlin and London,Taking the beat off, distorting it, and destroying it is becoming the “style. ”What lies here is the immediacy of emotion rather than the purity of sound. The fact that it’s not perfect resonates as “sincerity. ” 4. The end of the SNS era and the return of “fluctuation”4-1. Freedom of not being visibleThe era of “well-formed self-expression” dominated by Instagram and TikTok has changed. It’s slowly coming to an end. Nowadays, the younger generation wants things to “sway” rather than “stand out. ”Poorly focused photos, noisy recordings, and unedited videos. It is in them that I find evidence of my real self. 4-2. Escape from online to offline“The Aesthetics of Imperfection” isIt”s not just about aesthetics, it”s also about resetting your way of life. People who are tired of building their personalities on SNS and return to their “body” again. The humidity of the club, the roar of the live house,There is an imperfect but certain feeling within it. Music is once again returning to the “human scene” rather than the digital world. 5. Turning point in beauty ─ From “adjusting” to “collapsing”5-1. Courage to affirm imperfectionThe last ten years have been dominated by ideas of minimalism and tidying up. We have been afraid of what we are missing. But now, what is missing is the blank space for creation. Noisy sounds, blurred images, and stuck words. Instead of removing them, accept them as part of the work. Therein lies the sensibility of a new era. 5-2. “Rewilding” of popAfter “brat,” artists let go of their microphones. Impromptu recording with smartphone,I started uploading songs unfinished. What they all have in common is the attitude of ““leaving things as they are. ’’Pop is becoming wild again. It is the complete opposite of the inorganic perfection created by AI. It is also an attempt to return to the ““human rhythm. ’’ 6. The future of imperfection ─ Toward a new realityWe are finally on the verge of being freed from the shackles of “perfection. ”Outside the world arranged by algorithms,Errors, distortions, and obscurities shine once again. It’s evolution, not regression. The improvisational nature of music, the accidental nature of art,And evolution that affirms the instability that humans have. What is “The Aesthetics of Imperfection”?In short, it is the aesthetics of “living itself. ”It”s okay if it breaks. It”s okay to waver. The sound is not perfect, we are not perfect,The time has come to make this world sing again.

    "title": "[Column] Strange Musical Toys — Toys with strange sounds from around the world",
    "body": "“Sound toys” around the world      Text: mmr   Theme: From children’s toys to artists’ instruments - Toward the era of AI toys, tactile instruments, and social toys   There are places where the line between music and play becomes blurred. We live in a world where the electronic sounds of toys held in children’s hands are eventually recognized as creative tools for professional stages and artists. Weird sound sources like Radel, Omnichord, Stylophone, and Circuit Bending, which modified homemade circuits, became more than toys and became cultural experimental devices. In this column, we trace unusual musical toys from around the world, unraveling their history, philosophy, and reinterpretation by modern artists. Ⅰ. The pleasure of hands playing with soundWe must not forget that the ““tactile sense’’ is at the origin of the act of music. When you pluck the strings, press the keys, or turn the knobs, you receive a response at your fingertips. This immediacy is the same in the toys that children come into contact with during their childhood. In the 21st century, electronic sounds have been extended to children’s toys and educational gadgets, and the act of ““sounding’’ itself has been designed as part of play. The line between toys and musical instruments is becoming increasingly blurred. Ⅱ. Sound toy culture in AsiaRadel Electronic TanpuraThe electronic tabla, developed by the Indian company Radel in the late 1970s, is a device that portableizes the sustained sounds of traditional raga performance. It has become popular among a wide range of people, from children to adults, because it allows complex stringed instruments to be easily reproduced at home. The simplification of electronic sounds actually opened the door to new improvisations. The electronic tanpura placed on the desk at home has become a ““homely ritual’’ that resonates at the boundary between learning and play. Portable evolution of electronic musical instrumentsThe digitization of traditional musical instruments has progressed not only in India but also throughout Asia. Musical instruments that even children can operate have appeared, including small sitars, pocket-sized gamelans, and electronic harps. The stability and ease of sound created by electronic technology stimulates the creativity of performers. Ⅲ. Omnicode and its descendantsReleased in 1978, the Omnichord quickly became loved around the world as a unique “chord harp. ”  Unique interface combining keyboard and stroke board Easy to play simple chords with just one finger Lo-fi and cosmic tonesThe Omnichord has become more than a prop for techno-pop and indie artists during live performances and recordings. The sound is the embodiment of a design philosophy that welcomes chance and improvisation. Album using OmnichordCornelius – Fantasma (1997) Japanese pop/electronica. Omnichord’s unique chords add warmth to the song. Björk – Vespertine (2001) A fusion of subtle electronic sounds and analog feel. Omnichord’s delicate chord feel contributes to an introspective sound. Ⅳ. European strange sound devicesStylophone and OptiganThe British Stylophone is a desk synth familiar from 1970s TV ads. When you trace the metal contacts with your fingertips, a distinctive beep sounds. Its ease and noisy feel were incorporated into early techno-pop and avant-garde music. The Optigan is an organ toy that plays sounds using optical discs, and is characterized by unpredictable patterns and rhythms. Album using StylophoneDavid Bowie – Space Oddity (1969 single) Stylophone used in early singles. Characterized by a cosmic and minimalist tone. Aphex Twin – Selected Ambient Works 85–92 (1992) Ambient techno created by minisynths and toy-like electronic sounds. From educational toys to clubsIn Europe, educational electronic toys also found their way into club culture and avant-garde music. A simple synthesizer on a desk brought ““accidental noise’’ to the performers’ creativity, expanding the range of musical expression. Ⅴ. America’s DIY electronics and strange inventorsCircuit bending is a method of creating new sounds by modifying existing electronic toys and synths, and was codified by Reed Ghazala in the 1970s.  Open the Casio SA series keyboard and connect the circuits randomly Accidental short circuits and noises create new sounds The act of “destruction” and “creation” occurring at the same timeDIY electronic instruments have become deeply ingrained in American garage culture and avant-garde music, combining the joy of manual labor with a sense of sonic adventure. Circuit Bending / Use of modified toysMerzbow – Pulse Demon (1996) A noise experimental piece that makes full use of modified electronic equipment and noise toys. Ⅵ. Japan’s golden age of electronic toysIn the 1970s and 1980s, portable synths and electronic musical toys became popular in Japanese households.  Yamaha Portasound Series CASIO VL-TONE Educational synths such as Gakken’s SX-150Electronic sounds can be easily experienced on desks at home or at school, and children have become familiar with the culture of ““playing with sounds. ’’ In modern times, digital toys like Otamatone are connected to YouTube culture, creating a new world of “cute sounds. ” VII. Scandinavian irregular aestheticsIn Scandinavia, small, highly designed synthesizers have appeared.  Teenage Engineering OP-1 Pocket Operator seriesIts simple, intuitive operability and cartoon-like tone combine Scandinavian humor and sophistication. It is unique in that it retains its character as a toy, but is also used by professional artists. Pocket Operator / Teenage EngineeringFour Tet – Rounds (2003) It anticipates the atmosphere of a small electronic sound source similar to Pocket Operator. Minimal beat and melody. Flying Lotus – Cosmogramma (2010) A complex texture that combines electronic toys and small synth-like sounds. Ⅷ. Contemporary Artists and Toy SoundMany contemporary artists, including Björk, Cornelius, Bon Iver, and Laurie Anderson, have incorporated toy instruments into their live performances and recordings. Low-resolution sounds and accidental noises become tools for creating a sense of intimacy and improvisation, and are praised for daring to maintain a ““handmade’’ feel in the age of digital. Ⅸ. Future toy musicMusical toys, such as AI toys, tactile instruments, and social toys, continue to evolve as a testing ground for new interfaces. The concept of “play” is once again returning to the center of music creation and is playing an important cultural role in the future of electronic sound.

    "title": "[Column] Beyond Drift: Eurobeat/EDM and the future form of \"memory of speed\"",
    "body": "Introduction: To the other side of the mountain passText: mmr｜Theme: Initial D, Eurobeat, and the fate of the “acceleration of sound” that follows. ” “Initial D” and Eurobeat. The era when these connections functioned as a cultural device can no longer be talked about solely through ““nostalgia. ’’From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, the resonance of images of cars driving through mountain passes and high-tempo sounds created an unconscious, shared experience. Speed ​​= music, and music = acceleration of emotions. But times have moved on, cars have become quieter, and music has become streaming. Still, Eurobeat’s ““memory of speed’’ remains. Rather, it is now transforming into a new kind of “running music” in the context of digital space, AI generation, and real-time sound. 1. From “pass” to “trajectory”: the gradation of the musical space traced by EurobeatAs mentioned in the previous two works, the Eurobeat in Initial D was inseparable from Touge’s story. However, it was not just an aid to the terrain and visual production, but a device that translated the distortion of time into sound. Looking back now, we can say that Eurobeat was a genre that acoustically visualized the ““internal time of a running body. ’’Rushing beats, overflowing melodies, and repeating choruses all translated physical speed into emotional speed. In the 21st century, EDM, Trance, Synthwave, and even Hyperpop have inherited this lineage. It’s not the inheritance of a genre, but the inheritance of a sense of acceleration.  Rhythms with over 150 tempos extreme brightness of synth leads Excessive repetition of spatial reverb and clapsThese characteristics are exactly the echoes of Eurobeat. And now, its reverberations are once again beginning to pulsate in the internet space. 2. EDM, Synthwave, Hyperpop —— Eurobeat as a bloodlineIn the 2020s, there are many young artists who consciously quote Eurobeat-like “sense of acceleration”. For example, if you follow the ““Eurobeat Remake” and ““Nightcore Revival” tags on YouTube,You can see that countless tracks are being created at the intersection of EDM, anime culture, and game music. The build-up of EDM, the vocal chop of Hyperpop, the melody lift of Trance. What runs through them is the idea of ​​”“sound that designs upliftment’’. And the origin of that philosophy is none other than the Eurobeat of the 90s.  “Speed ​​is the language of the times. ”— anonymous Eurobeat producer, 1998 interview This word now takes on new meaning in the age of generative music. Speed ​​is not just a tempo, but exists as the speed at which emotions are calculated. 3. Automotive × Music Technology: Autonomous Driving, VR/AR, SoundscapeIf Eurobeat was born on the ““pass”, the next step would be ““orbit”. It could be a satellite orbit or a VR driving space. New coordinates are now unfolding for music and speed to intersect again. ● Self-driving car × music parameter linkageAnalyzes vehicle speed, steering wheel angle, tilt sensor, GPS coordinates, etc. in real time,A “reactive BGM engine” that automatically adjusts tempo, reverb, and EQ is in the testing stage. In other words, the era in which the behavior of a car plays music has arrived. Reproduce the “drift feeling” of Eurobeat with acoustic parameters. This is a technological reenactment of what Initial D used to do with video and music. ● VR/AR driving spaceSoundscapes play an important role in virtual driving environments. Wind noise, tire friction, tunnel echoes, engine fluctuations…By synchronizing all of this to a Eurobeat-like tempo, the sense of immersion increases dramatically. “Touge” is now inside a VR headset. And the sounds made inside are not a reenactment of the past, but are reconstructed as future driving memories. 4. Fusion of sound and space: installation as running music, live experienceAn art movement that audibly reproduces the feeling of running has begun in various parts of the world.    Mobile Sound LiveA live performance in which a special vehicle is equipped with a sound system, and the sound changes based on acceleration data while driving. The hi-hat is amplified when drifting, and the bass becomes distorted in corners.     Sound tunnel installationA space where the pitch and tempo of the sound changes as the audience walks. Just like “walking drift,” your movements generate sound.     Replay in club space“Virtual Toge Night” is a Eurobeat x EDM set that projects images of Toge behind the DJ booth. The floor is a curve, and the audience is an engine.  What these efforts demonstrate is the fact that Eurobeat is moving from ““listening music” to ““experiential music. ” 5. Media that shares “memory of speed”: AI remix, generative music, participatory expressionNow that AI music generation has become commonplace, Eurobeat has gone beyond a “reproducible genre”. It is becoming a genre that is driven by users. ● AI Drift RemixWhen you input the driving log (speed, route, curve information) into the AI,Automatically generates a Eurobeat-style track that corresponds to that driving style. The era of ““your driving becoming the song’’ is already beginning to become a reality on the test bench. ● Eurobeat revival from SNSOn TikTok and YouTube, the number of posts that combine “Eurobeat x own driving video” has increased explosively. These are not just nostalgia, but function as a ““new format for sharing the feeling of driving. ’’It is, so to speak, a ““speed-sharing medium’’. ● NFT/Blockchain and redefining music ownershipConvert driving data and sound generation results into NFT,Owning the one-time experience of ““this curve, this speed, this sound. ’’Eurobeat thus turns into Saved Acceleration. 6. Conclusion: Can Eurobeat transform into “saved acceleration”?What ““Initial D” presented was a ““sensory speed theory” in which cars and music became one. That spirit continues to live on, albeit in a different form in the digital age. Eurobeat is being revived not as a nostalgic thing, but as a medium that records, plays, and generates speed. Acceleration reconstructed by AI. A mountain pass reenacted in VR. Traces of speed that remain as data. The code that binds them all is pulsating within the three letters “Eurobeat. ”  Every time you press the play button, that curve is waiting for you. But this time, you will be able to draw that curve as “your own sound. ” Diagram: Eurobeat development timelineflowchart TDA1990[ 1990: The turning point from Italo Disco to Eurobeat ]A1995[ 1995:   Initial D'' animated, combined with runner culture ]A2000[ 2000: The SEB series enters its golden age ]A2010[ 2010: Net Revival (Nightcore, Eurobeat Meme) ]A2020[ 2020: AI-generated music/inherited to VR driving experience ]A2025[ 2025: Eurobeat as Interactive Sound Media concept ]A1990 --&gt; A1995 --&gt; A2000 --&gt; A2010 --&gt; A2020 --&gt; A2025Reference discography (Selected Eurobeat / Influence)      Year   Title   Artist   Link         1994   Super Eurobeat Vol. 50   V.

    "title": "[Column] Glitch: When noise turns into beauty",
    "body": "The pleasure of errorText: mmr｜Theme: The moment when error turns into beauty. Glitch culture, born from digital fraying, reflects the “broken aesthetic” of the 21st century. A feature-length cultural theory about music, images, and fragments of society. A quiet computer screen late at night. The image that is being rendered suddenly breaks into pieces and pixels go out of control. Suddenly, in that ““broken moment,’’ I find myself feeling beautiful. That was the beginning of Glitch. In the past, “error” was something that should be eliminated. But now, errors have become “expressions. ”In the small flaws that occur within a perfect system, we find something nostalgic about our humanity. Glitch is the aesthetic language of the 21st century, a poem born at the moment when technology reveals its limitations. Sound of Glitch: The day noise became musicIn the early 1990s, Germany’s Oval intentionally scratched the surface of a CD and recorded the moment when the player could no longer read it. That irregular clicking sound, intermittent rhythm due to missing data. Although it was a “sound of error,” it was strangely organic and somehow warm. Around the same time, Ryoji Ikeda and Alva Noto used DSP processing to hone sine waves and noise particles to the limit. Programming environments such as Max/MSP and SuperCollider actively introduce accidental bugs and randomness into music. This trend blossomed in the early 2000s as the Clicks &amp; Cuts movement, reinventing the aesthetics of electronic music. Glitch was a technique for converting the ““coincidence fluctuations’’ produced by digital devices into poetic rhythms. The fact that the sound “breaks” is no longer a failure. It is the emergence of a new order. Glitch Visuals: The moment a pixel breaksGlitch has also been quietly gaining popularity in the world of film. A technique called datamosh intentionally destroys the compressed data of a video, creating a strange sequence of frames that seem to blend together. Lost pixels change shape like fluid, blurring the boundaries between reality and unreality. As media artist Rosa Menkman writes in ““The Glitch Moment(um)’’:  “Glitch is an aesthetic that exposes the invisible structures of media. ” For her, an error is not just a breakdown, but a momentary “self-disclosure” in which a system reveals itself. We are used to seeing perfect images. That’s why the unstable beauty created by JPEG corruption and signal noise feels somehow human. Glitch has also permeated fashion and advertising. The method of incorporating the disordered pixels into the design took the street culture by storm in the late 2010s as “broken design. ”We are finally able to enjoy the fact that it is not perfect, and that even digital has “noise”. Glitch as philosophySo why are we attracted to “broken things”?Philosophically speaking, it is a yearning for the uncontrollable. Heidegger called the essence of technology the “disclosure of being. ”Glitch is exactly the moment when technology reveals its own “limitations” - in other words, the world rips apart. People find beauty in the “different order” that peeks through the gaps. Glitch is also an aesthetic of generativity. Unexpected coincidences intervene in an algorithm that operates under complete control. Humans find life-like reality in this “uncertainty. ” A landscape that can only be seen by losing control. This is where modern creativity resides. Glitch in Society: Noise running through social systemsGlitch isn’t just about art. It is also a metaphor that reflects the very structure of society. “Bug-like phenomena” caused by SNS algorithms—sudden spread of information, flare-ups, and misrecognition. “Hallucination” generated by AI—a world where reality and fiction intermingle. These are all structural glitches of digital society. The emergence of NFT art is also a noise that has changed the concept of “ownership” in the age of digital reproduction. Although data should be able to be copied infinitely, it redefines scarcity as a “one-of-a-kind item. ”Contradictions continue to exist as contradictions—that’s what Glitch is all about. Society will become increasingly “optimized. ”However, the optimized world is somehow stifling. That’s why we feel a sense of freedom in unintentional bugs and noises. Acceptance and variation of Glitch culture in JapanGlitch’s reception in Japan was accompanied by a unique sensibility. Glitch pop developed by Seiho and Tatsuro Kojima in club culture. It was an attempt to incorporate noise into the structure of pop. On the other hand, media artists such as Daito Manabe and evala designed the acoustic space itself as a “visualized Glitch. ” This aesthetic is deeply embedded in anime and video works as well. Bug effects seen in “Cyber ​​Coil”, “Ghost in the Shell SAC_2045”, and “EVA:3. 0+1. 0”——It has become a device that symbolizes the ““fluctuation of cognition’’ in an information-overloaded society. And now, in a night club in Tokyo,Fragments of sound made up of broken samples echo like the heartbeat of the city itself. Glitch has gone beyond the boundaries of art and has become our “everyday sound. ” Future: The future of Post-GlitchBeing “broken” is no longer special. We live in an era where AI generates “simulated bugs” and designs noise. How do humans create “coincidence” in a perfectly controlled simulation? Post-Glitch is the aesthetics of an era where even things that break are designed. In this world, errors are also a language, and the ““fictional noise’’ produced by generative AI becomes a new kind of poetry. Perhaps we live in this “bug-filled world”. I”m sure I”ll become more and more attached to it. Because Glitch is who we are. A perfect and impossible existence. An existence that continues to move despite its contradictions and noises. Humans themselves are the biggest Glitch. Conclusion: Hope inside the bugThe world continues to fall apart. Our networks, our cities, and ourselves. Even so, a certain rhythm and color are still alive within these fragments. Glitch is a record of courage that is unafraid to break. It is a modern poem that attempts to exist beautifully despite the noise.

    "title": "[Column] The illusion of EDM: Celebrating and rebuilding in the digital age",
    "body": "There is a moment when sound becomes architecture      Text: mmr   Theme: Festivals and cities, sound and light, crowds and technology. How has the phenomenon of EDM changed the shape of celebrations in the 21st century?   A flash of laser light splits the night sky, the bass shakes deep within its body, and countless arms raise in unison. The phenomenon called “EDM” was more than just a music genre, it was a celebration of the digital age. In the 2010s, cities around the world were reshaped by the sound. The desert of Las Vegas, the forests of Belgium, the bay of Tokyo. In this column, we will take a look at EDM’s birth, transformation, and “beyond” from the intersection of sound, light, the body, and technology. Ⅰ. EDM as a building of light and soundIt was not an extension of the club, but a redesign of the city itself. Hundreds of thousands of people jump at the same time. The stage is like the gate of a futuristic city. EDM was the ““festival architecture’’ of the 21st century. Originally, the word EDM was more of a marketing term than a genre name. However, that ambiguity was a symbol of the times. It didn’t matter if it was house, techno, or trance—what was important was the experience. Everyone has at least once believed in the illusion that one sound can shake the world. Ⅱ. Origin: From Chicago to Las VegasThe origin of the story is in Chicago’s ““Warehouse’’ in the 1970s. Frankie Knuckles’ play turned the club into a community. In the 1980s, techno was born in Detroit, and electronic sounds began to tell the story of the future. Eventually, in the late 2000s, European club culture was “re-imported” to America. “Levels” by Avicii, “Don”t You Worry Child” by Swedish House Mafia, “Titanium” by David Guetta. They weren’t just songs, they were a “language of light. ”In the 2010s, EDM rose to the center of pop. Underground dreams turned into arena cheers. Ⅲ. Evolution of sound designBehind the sound is a DAW and synth revolution. Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro. We live in an era where you can compose music with just a laptop. “Massive” by Native Instruments, “Serum” by Xfer, “Sylenth1” by Lennar Digital. What these developments resulted in was the ““weaponization of sound. ’’ Especially side chain compression. That unique “pumping” that makes the whole body breathe in time with the kick. That’s the heartbeat of EDM. It was the moment when the techniques of club music were extended to the masses. Ⅳ. Birth of festival cultureTomorrowland, Ultra, EDC. Everyone now knows these three initials. The stage is not just a set, but an architectural installation. A screen envelops the forest and fireworks weave the sky. The audience becomes “particles of light” and the sound and images are synchronized. EDM festivals were a new communal ritual created by technology. A sociologist would say this. “Democratization of the trance state”——We live in an era of pseudo-religious experiences where everyone shares the same heartbeat at the same moment. Ⅴ. The era of global capital and SNSEDM was accompanied by a “revolution in distribution. ”SoundCloud, YouTube, Beatport. DJs from all over the world exchanged sounds with a single click. In the late 2010s, EDM became a meme. The drop is cut on TikTok and the rhythm goes viral like a GIF. The Chainsmokers’ ““Closer’’ is a symbol of this. A DJ is both a producer and a brand. Logos, perfumes, NFTs, headphones—all have become “industries surrounding sound. ” Ⅵ. Branching and mutation: Post-EDM horizonEventually, the celebrations start to wear out. People tired of the glare of the main stage began to return to dark clubs. “Introspective EDM” demonstrated by Porter Robinson and Madeon——It wasn’t a festival, it was a sound dealing with individual emotions. Future Bass, Trap, Tech House, Drumstep. Genres are branching out, and the term “EDM” no longer has any meaning. However, at the heart of it all was always a admiration for technology. The resonance between humans and machines, that pleasure, was the essence of EDM. VII. EDM acceptance in JapanEDM took root in Japan in earnest around 2013. When ULTRA JAPAN landed and ZEDD and Hardwell came to Japan,The sky over the bay was filled with light. In Japan, it was first introduced as a “festival” rather than a club. This may have been an expression of their ““desire for community. ’’ Yasutaka Nakata, Perfume, Ado——J-POP absorbed the structure of EDM and evolved into a more dramatic and visual sound. For the TikTok generation, being able to dance may not be about the body but the movement of the fingertips. Light bouncing around digitally, crowds behind smartphones. Japanese EDM has taken on a new form: an introverted celebration. VIII. Technology and Spirit: Utopia drawn by machinesWe have now entered an era where AI generates music in real time. Still, people still seek ““drops. ’’This is because there are moments when your body senses time. DJs are no longer just “music selectors. ”He is a manipulating composer who reads the breathing of the crowd in real time. Lighting, VJ, sound, stage configuration—all synchronize as one comprehensive piece of art. EDM is at the same time a celebration of technology. It was the act of humans using technology to expand their humanity. Ⅸ. Final chapter: Towards a post-EDM music experienceThe term “EDM” may now seem like a relic of the past. But its legacy already permeates all genres. Pop, hip hop, game music…Inherits the aesthetics of drop structure and sound pressure. Celebrations from now on will no longer be limited to physical stages. Metaverse, AR, virtual DJ. The crowd becomes an avatar, and the light flows as a code. EDM isn’t over. It’s just changing form. **The digital celebration isn’t over yet. ** Appendix A: Chronology — EDM Major Movements (1990–2025)flowchart TDA1990[ 1990: Rise of Techno/Trance (expansion of European club scene) ]A2000[ 2000: The budding of Progressive House and Electro House ]A2010[ 2010: EDM boom in full swing (Avicii, Guetta, SHM) ]A2013[ 2013: Ultra Japan, Tomorrowland becomes a symbol ]A2016[ 2016: Introspective EDM by Porter Robinson and others ]A2020[ 2020: The rise of virtual festivals during the pandemic ]A2025[ 2025: AI-generated music and Metaverse DJ fusion ]A1990 --&gt; A2000 --&gt; A2010 --&gt; A2013 --&gt; A2016 --&gt; A2020 --&gt; A2025Appendix B: Major Artist Discography      Artist   Representative work   Release year   Link         Avicii   True   2013   Amazon       Swedish House Mafia   Until Now   2012   Amazon       David Guetta   Nothing But the Beat   2011   Amazon       ZEDD   Clarity   2012   Amazon       Porter Robinson   Worlds   2014   Amazon       The Chainsmokers   Memories…Do Not Open   2017   Amazon       Madeon   Adventure   2015   Amazon   Appendix C: Major DAW/Synth/Equipment List      Category   Name   Notes         DAW   Ableton Live   Designed for live performance       DAW   FL Studio   For beat-making-oriented, young producers       DAW   Logic Pro   Integrated environment for composing/mixing       Synth   Xfer Serum   Symbolizes the tonal design of modern EDM       Synth   NI Massive   Mainstay of the late 2000s and early 2010s       Synth   Sylenth1   Strong in classic lead sounds       Plug-in   Waves L2/FabFilter Pro-L   Mastering standard that supported the loudness wars       DJ equipment   Pioneer CDJ series   Global standard DJ play equipment       Monitor   KRK Rokit/Yamaha HS5   A must-have monitor for bedroom producers   "

    "title": "[Column] Blawan: Pleasure of Steel and the Body Deep in the Night — Echoes of the Dreams of UK Techno",
    "body": "Prologue Rhythm that grew in the shadow of factories—from the lingering scent of industryText: mmr｜Theme: About Blawan’s cold yet somehow human beat that continues to have roots in the UK underground Once upon a time, the industrial areas of northern England were filled with the smell of steam and metal. Jamie Roberts – or Blawan – may have grown up unconsciously inhaling its reverberations. The bloodline of electronic music flowing from Sheffield (Cabaret Voltaire, Warp Records, The Black Dog)It has echoed the rhythm of labor and the breathing of the city at the same time. Blawan’s beat has the sound of hammering iron and the pressure of humid air. It”s not just techno, it”s also a rebirth of industrial memory. It is also symbolic that he is not based in London or Berlin, but continues to have roots in the UK underground. –Sound does not leave the gravity of the land.  The beat was cold and somehow human. Blawan’s music is a record of the “body temperature” that sleeps inside steel. Chapter 1 Iron story starting from Bohla“Bohla EP” was released by R&amp;S Records in 2011. The hard yet strangely soft rhythm brought a “new weight” to the club. It’s a UK club sound trying to break out of the chaos of post-dubstep. It was a newly discovered ““touch. ’’ At this time, Blawan loved Roland rhythm machines and analog filters. Grasp the sound with your fingertips and knobs, not in a DAW. It was the physical sensation of ““playing’’ electronic sounds that made his sound as hot as iron. Chapter 2 “Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage. ”——The boundary between fear and pleasureIn 2012, the world club scene shook. “Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage. ”This one song made Blawan’s name definitive. The title is disturbing. The distorted vocal sample sounds like a ghost groaning in a basement. The beat is heavy and repeats with a tenacity that borders on madness. However, there is a strange “pleasure” within it. It compressed the listener’s body and at the same time released it - it was a moment of fear and euphoria. Many DJs drop this track at peak times,The club floor was reportedly engulfed in a moment of “violent euphoria. ”This song is not just a hit,It was a symbol of reviving ““feelings without emotions’’ in techno. Chapter 3 Karenn”s body—resonance with PariahBlawan’s other face is Karenn. The duo with his ally Pariah (Arthur Cayzer) was more of a workshop than a studio. He founded the Sheworks label and toured Europe with impromptu equipment gigs. A pile of cables. A rhythm machine that never stops ringing. The coldness of the machines and the sweat of humans coexisted there. Karenn’s live performances are more like “forging” than “performance. ”The sound of steel hitting, the heated air, and the body heat of the audience. For a moment when everything melts together, music becomes “substance. ” Chapter 4 Wet Will Always Dry——Record of emotions without emotionsIn 2018, Blawan finally released a full-length album, Wet Will Always Dry. As the title suggests, **Wet, Dry. **What we see there is an incomplete cycle of human emotions. “Careless” “North” “Stell”――Every song hides a slight warmth beneath its coldness. Amidst the expressionless, metallic sound, there are occasional pauses that look like breathing. Human emotions permeate through that small gap. Strip away the sound and leave only the structure. On the contrary, his stoicism makes Blawan’s “emotion” stand out. Chapter 5 A club without a body—Blawan in the 2020sDuring the pandemic, clubs went silent. However, Blawan’s sound is quietly changing. Tracks like “Under Belly” and “Toast” have a softer, more introspective feel than before. The hardware noise sounds kind of gentle. Even when the club closed, the rhythm in his body didn’t go away. He found ““human breath’’ in modular synths. This is the paradoxical sound of an era in which electronic devices imitate the heartbeat. Chapter 6 People and city surrounding BlawanBlawan’s sound does not belong to any one artist. UK industrial genes built by Regis and Surgeon,The violent rhythms of Paula Temple and Giant Swan,And the delicate particles of Skee Mask. All of that is being rebuilt within him. Rather than the sterility of Berlin, I prefer the humidity of London. Use the pressure of your palm rather than digital. Blawan continues to choose land weight. It is also a form of resistance for the club to continue to be a ““place’’ once again. Chapter 7 SickElixir — The rhythm of the collapse and rebirth of the steel cityBlawan”s latest work [“SickElixir” (2025)] (https://www. amazon. co. jp/dp/B087B9MBK4) is a rare work that dismantles the structure of techno but still makes you feel the presence of “humanity’. Amid swirling noise and distortion, the rhythm maintains its balance on the verge of collapse, and the voice loses its meaning and transforms into an instrument. The light shining in with “Rabbit Hole” and the torrent of deep bass with “NOS”. With each moment, Blawan’s sound straddles the line between coldness and passion. In the background lies his own life, including the loss of friends and struggles with addiction. Behind the cold mechanical sounds is the breathing sound of loss and rebirth. After making an impact with ““Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage. ”, what he has arrived at after more than 10 years is ““a prayer that dwells in destruction. ” At a time when techno is becoming more abstract and clubs are melting into the digital world, Blawan dares to bring back “gravity. ”The beat that runs through the veins of the Steel City. In it, he quietly asks: Can sound still be human? ** Chapter 8 Chronology + Discographyflowchart TDA2010[ 2010: Debut with 'Fram' EP (Hessle Audio) ]A2011[ 2011:  Bohla EP  (R&amp;S Records) released ]A2012[ 2012: Breakthrough with  Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage.  ]A2013[ 2013: Pariah and Karenn activities in full swing (Sheworks established) ]A2018[ 2018: Full album  Wet Will Always Dry  (Ternesc) announced ]A2020[ 2020: New innovations such as 'Immulsion  and  Under Belly' ]A2023[ 2023: Re-evaluate with modular-centered live set ]A2025[ 2025: Blawan = redefined as a symbol of modern UK techno ]A2010 --&gt; A2011 --&gt; A2012 --&gt; A2013 --&gt; A2018 --&gt; A2020 --&gt; A2023 --&gt; A2025      Year   Title   Label   Link         2011   Bohla EP   R&amp;S Records   Amazon       2012   Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage.

I’m just chasing the moment when the rhythm makes the air tremble. “—— Blawan  “When I first heard that “Why They Hide Their Bodies…”The club felt like it was “frozen” for a moment. Fear and pleasure come at the same time. A truck like that comes around once every 10 years. “—— Ben UFO (Hessle Audio)   ”Blawan has a proper temperature in its ““hard sound’’. That’s what makes me different from everyone else. I look like I work in a factory, but I’m actually a poet. “—— Pariah (Karenn)  “When you go to his studio, the first thing you see is silence. The silence before turning on the switch is already laden with rhythm. That space itself is the “batting surface. ” “—— Paula Temple  “When I play Blawan at the DJ site,Everyone stands ready for a moment. But then you laugh. Your body reacts on its own. That’s not logical. “—— Object  “I was watching Karenn”s live performance from the sidelines,It felt like being inside a steelworks. Sounds like sparks flying. Still, the faces of the audience were somehow kind. “—— Surgeon (Anthony Child)  “As club culture melts into digital,Blawan has regained his “gravity”. Sound falls to the ground. I think that’s the most human thing to do right now. “—— From Resident Advisor writer comment  “There is a “hand” in the sound. That’s the sound of Blawan. “—— Anonymous DJ, a word after the Boiler Room set  “His music is not ‘inorganic’. He’s just acting an inorganic character. The moment when the listener senses that there is a temperature there. He cuts down on the sound for that moment. “—— Music writer/reconstruction comment Final Chapter: Prayer of Steel—Dancing is survivalBlawan’s sound is sometimes cold and sometimes harsh. However, deep within, there is certainly a ““human prayer. ’’The act of dancing is a ritual for “surviving” in the noise of the city. “Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage. ” still attracts people becauseBecause there is both fear and relief. A sound like steel. But every time I listen to it, my temperature rises. Blawan is an artist whose blood flows through the cold world.  “Sound is the shadow of the body”——Blawan (from interview) Appendix: Blawan modular setup diagram (2020–2025) “All sounds begin with touch. ”——Blawan flowchart TDsubgraph  🎚️ Control Section MATHS[ Make Noise MATHS\\n(Envelope / Modulator) ]PAM[ Pamela's New Workout\\n(Clock / Sync Generator) ]METROP[ Intellijel Metropolis\\n(Sequencer) ]endsubgraph  🎛️ Sound Generation (oscillation/modulation) OSC[ Mutable Instruments Plaits\\n(Multi-oscillator) ]VCO[ Verbos Complex VCO\\n(Analog Oscillator) ]DFAM[ Moog DFAM\\n(Drum Synth) ]BASS[ Erica Synths Bassline\\n(Acid / Low-end) ]endsubgraph  🔧Processing/Effects FILTER[ XAOC Belgrad\\n(Dual Filter) ]DIST[ Elektron Analog Heat\\n(Distortion / Saturator) ]REVERB[ Strymon BigSky\\n(Reverb) ]DELAY[ Make Noise Mimeophon\\n(Delay / Texture) ]endsubgraph  🔊 Output &amp; Mixing MIX[ WMD Performance Mixer ]OUT[ Audio Interface\\n(RME Fireface / Ableton Integration) ]REC[ Recording / Master Chain ]endPAM --&gt; METROPMETROP --&gt; OSCMETROP --&gt; DFAMMATHS --&gt; FILTEROSC --&gt; FILTERDFAM --&gt; DISTFILTER --&gt; DELAYDELAY --&gt; REVERBREVERB --&gt; MIXDIST --&gt; MIXMIX --&gt; OUTOUT --&gt; RECBlawan Studio Features Memo      Classification   Equipment   Application   Features         Sequencer   Intellijel Metropolis   Melody/Rhythm Generation   Emphasis on hard 16-step feel       Oscillator   Verbos Complex VCO / Plaits   Main oscillation source   Combination of analog distortion and digital particles       Drum Synth   Moog DFAM   Metallic percussion   The core of Blawan’s “industrial noise”       FX Chain   Analog Heat / Mimeophon / BigSky   Texture adjustment   Build space with drive and reverb       Mixer   WMD Performance Mixer   Real-time construction   Also used for Karenn live       Recorder   RME Fireface + Ableton   Final recording   “One-shot recording” philosophy without overdubs   The sounds produced by this setup are completely hand-crafted electronic sounds.

In an era where everyone consumes sound on their smartphones,Blawan is trying to bring back the sound of touch. There is a human warmth within the steel-like sound. That contradiction is the reason for his existence.  “I believe in techno. As long as someone is still dancing. “—— Blawan Related columns🔗 [Column] The Golden Age of UK Techno 🔗 [Column] From the origins of techno to the present - a chronological history traced through famous records and equipment 🔗 The genealogy and present of German Techno - the aesthetics of sound spreading from Berlin to the world 🔗 [Column] Tresor - The sacred place of techno that changed the world from underground in Berlin 🔗 [Column] Detroit Techno: Human dance created by the heartbeat of machines "

    "title": "[Column] Open reel revival theory: Magnetism records the future again",
    "body": "Signs of reel-to-reel revival — sound as matter is reconnectedText: mmr｜Theme: What can the analog technology of magnetism tell us in the post-digital era?—The future of “Reel to Real” seen through the reprint of Rhino High Fidelity  The news announced by Rhino High Fidelity as part of their analog reprint series has caused a stir in the audio culture world. T. Rex”s ““Electric Warrior” and Yes”s ““The Yes Album,” both masterpieces released in 1971, will be re-released in reel-to-reel tape format. Records returned and cassettes were revived. The next thing that is rewound is Reel to Reel. This movement is not just nostalgia. This is a movement to bring back ““sound as material’’ in an era where data is becoming increasingly lightweight and streaming is becoming more widespread. Chapter 1 Analog after digital — Rebooting “lost physicality”Spotify and Apple Music have created a world where you can listen to music instantly and anywhere. But there is no sense of touch. The sound became an abstract waveform on the cloud, losing its texture. Reel-to-reel is the exact opposite. Listeners change the reels, watch the rotation, and “play” the magnetic flow. There is an act of physically handling time. Sound is not just reproduced data, but returns to a phenomenon involving movement and friction. What modern people are looking for may be this “regenerating body. ”Reel-to-reel is a device that encourages the rematerialization of listening. Chapter 2 Media Theory of Magnetism — What is Recording?If you look at the surface of the tape with a microscope, you will see countless magnetic particles lined up there. Sound is a physical pattern in which electrical signals are arranged as magnetic shading. Unlike the digital world, which is made up of 0s and 1s, there is a ““continuous world’’ here. What Reel-to-Reel depicts is not sonic data, but sound memory. It is a technology that prioritizes ““vividness” over ““accuracy. ”Magnetized tape contains the atmosphere of the performance, the humidity of the space, and even the engineer’s intentions. In other words, it is a “material time device” that mediates sound. In contrast to infinite digital reproduction, reel-to-reel magnetism deteriorates, stretches, and disappears. However, it is this “finiteness” that turns sound into a special event. Chapter 3 Genealogy and next wave of analog revivalOver the past 20 years, we have witnessed the ““analog comeback’’ many times. Records revive the visual ritual** through the “object” of the jacket. Cassettes brought back the DIY spirit and lo-fi freedom. And reel-to-reel goes even further. It is a return to the ““pure form of sound’’, and the very origin of the act of recording. Determined to engrave sound not on a hard disk or on the cloud, but on the irreversible substance of magnetism. The analog revival is not just a nostalgic revival;It’s a human counterculture to digital saturation. Chapter 4 What Rhino High Fidelity presents — “High-Resolution Nostalgia”For Rhino’s reprint, we have selected two works from 1971 that symbolize the pinnacle of analog recording. T. Rex’s ““Electric Warrior’’ is a glam rock metal heat. Yes “The Yes Album” is a progressive rock acoustic space. The intention is to reproduce them with a quality that is as close as possible to the master tapes. However, what is important here is not “sound quality”. “High Fidelity” is not only “high fidelity” but also faithfulness to reality. Noise and distortion have been removed by the wave of digitalization,In fact, it was proof of the human imperfection that music had. Rhino’s endeavor represents a shift from “perfect reproduction” to “honest reproduction. ”It is an act of “believing in sound” rather than “consuming sound. ” Chapter 5 Reelism 2025: The birth of a new analog cultureReel-to-reel is currently undergoing a quiet update. Companies such as Recording The Masters and ATR Magnetics have resumed tape production;Young engineers and artists are rebuilding the “Reel culture. ” In the area of ​​ambient and experimental music,Open reel is being reevaluated as a ““media that shows processes’‘**. Rather than cutting and pasting sounds,I actually cut the tape, splice it, and edit it by hand. This analog operation paradoxically stimulates the creativity of the digital generation. Reel-to-reel is no longer “vintage”;“Hacker analog” is becoming a symbol of post-digital. Chapter 6 Reel to Mind — The future of perception expanded by analogListening to reel-to-reel is not like rewinding time. Rather, it is an act of reconstructing time. As the tape is played, the number of tapes decreases, and the sound continues to play in a finite space. Its finite nature encourages listeners to concentrate and immerse themselves. Just as the infinite loop of streaming gave rise to “listening while listening,”Reel’s finite time will help you regain your ability to concentrate on listening. Analog is no longer retro. It’s another way technology expands human senses. Final Chapter: Where does the magnetic memory go?The sounds engraved on magnetic bands are not records of the past, but physical messages for the future. As digital technology dominates memory as “data,”Reel-to-reel is trying to regain its memory as a “material”. The reissue of Rhino High Fidelity is just the first symbolic step.

    "title": "[Column] From Chicago to the world: The birth and evolution of house music",
    "body": "A revolution that started in an underground warehouse      Text: mmr   Theme: “Chicago House” was not just a place for entertainment, but a place for self-expression and a sense of community.    In the early 1980s, Chicago’s club scene was experiencing a lull due to the decline of disco. As disco grew commercially and disappeared from radio and the mainstream, young people were looking for a new outlet for musical expression. One of the answers was the music that later became known as ““Chicago House. ’’ The Warehouse club was a musical testing ground during this period. In a vast warehouse-like space, members of the black community, LGBTQ+ community, and urban youth gathered to immerse themselves in music. This place was not just a place for entertainment, but also a place for self-expression and a sense of community. Chapter 1: Genesis — Chicago’s Club Culture and 1980s Urban BackgroundChicago Club — Warehouse and its spacesChicago house developed around the ““Warehouse club. ’’Opened in 1977, the Warehouse was an abandoned urban factory converted into a warehouse club that became legendary when Frankie Knuckles played there as DJ. The vast space of the warehouse, the height of the ceiling, and the echo of the concrete gave the music a unique depth and dynamism. The sounds on the floor resonated with the bodies of the audience, creating a communal experience that went beyond a mere musical experience. Social background of Chicago in the 1980sThe early 1980s were tough economic times for Chicago.  Increased unemployment rate due to industrial decline Community division due to urban redevelopment Racial disparities and social inequalityFilling this urban void, club culture functioned as a new venue for social and cultural expression. Disillusioned with the commercialization of disco, young people flocked to clubs such as the Warehouse, The Power Plant, and Music Box to enjoy freedom through music. Club management and communityThe club kept admission fees to a minimum and provided an environment where local DJs and artists could play freely. This free space has given Chicago House a DIY spirit and a community culture. As an anecdote, Frankie Knuckles read the cheers from the crowd late at night and subtly changed the rhythm, creating a moment when everyone’s bodies swayed in unison. The audience responded with cheers and applause, demonstrating that music is a social and cultural phenomenon. Chapter 2: The Creators of Chicago HouseFrankie Knuckles — Godfather of HouseA New York native, Knuckles shaped Chicago’s club culture by DJing at the Warehouse. Influenced by disco and soul, they made full use of rhythm machines and synthesizers to create new grooves. Under his hands, DJs have changed from mere craftsmen who connect songs to directors who control the entire floor. Marshall Jefferson — Dancefloor RevolutionJefferson created “Move Your Body” to promote participatory dance experiences in clubs. The technique of eliciting a physical reaction from the audience through subtle changes in the intro has elevated music from a mere series of sounds to a social phenomenon. Larry Heard — the spiritual expression of deep houseLarry Heard created ““Can You Feel It’’ at home using simple equipment. With its deep meditative groove, the track not only contributed to the clubbing experience, but also to the listener’s individual spiritual journey. Chapter 3: Styles and Subgenres Acid House: Using TB-303, psychedelic sound waves Deep House: Meditative and soulful, represented by Larry Heard Vocal House: Emphasis on lyrics and emotional expression, reflecting the voices of the communityEarly house music was characterized by simple, repetitive rhythms and was created using Roland TR-808/TR-909 rhythm machines and analog synths. A small sound ingenuity had the power to change the atmosphere of the entire club. Chapter 4: The intersection of society and cultureChicago House has grown with the support of the black and LGBTQ+ communities. The club was a safe haven, a place free from discrimination and prejudice. Through music, self-expression and community formation progressed, and it became a symbol of minority culture in the city. Anecdotally, one night at Warehouse, Knuckles’ slight change in the tempo of his intro instantly changed the mood throughout the floor. The audience responded with cheers and applause, demonstrating that music is a social and cultural phenomenon. Chapter 5: Technology and Production MethodsChicago House is closely connected to the evolution of technology.  Sound creation with rhythm machine and synthesizer Possibility of home production with samplers and digital recording technology Democratization of culture through independent labels and the DIY spiritLarry Heard’s home-produced Can You Feel It is an anecdote that symbolizes the democratization of music and the expansion of club culture. Chapter 6: Unexpected relationshipsChicago House intersects with seemingly unrelated fields.  Architecture/Urban Space: The acoustics of a warehouse space determine the musical experience Fashion: Sportswear and high-top sneakers become cultural identity Technology: Electronic instruments and sound design expand musical expression LGBTQ+ movement: Clubs become safe zones and places of expression Spiritual Experience: Euphoria due to repetitive rhythm DIY culture/punk spirit: The foundation of independent production, independent labels, and community cultureChapter 7: From Chicago to the WorldIn the late 1980s, Chicago House expanded beyond its borders.  Starts the acid house boom in the UK Forming an international network through interaction with Detroit Techno Re-evaluated at clubs and festivals around the worldChapter 8: Representative discography      Artist   Title   Year   Link         Frankie Knuckles   Baby Powder / Your Love   1983   Amazon       Marshall Jefferson   Move Your Body   1986   Amazon       Larry Heard   Can You Feel It   1986   Amazon       Phuture   Acid Tracks   1987   Amazon       Jesse Saunders   On &amp; On   1984   Amazon   Chapter 9: Historical Background of Chicago HouseChicago’s economic and urban structure, social inequality, and industrial decline laid the groundwork for the birth of house music. Clubs were more than just entertainment; they were social and cultural testing grounds, and symbols of freedom and solidarity among city dwellers. Chicago House, thus born, spread throughout the world as a cultural phenomenon that intersected urban culture, technology, social movements, and music history. flowchart TDA1977[ 1977: Warehouse opened ] --&gt; B1983[ 1983: Frankie Knuckles DJ started playing ]B1983 --&gt; C1984[ 1984: The Power Plant opens, young DJs emerge ]C1984 --&gt; D1985[ 1985: Music Box opens, deep house penetration ]D1985 --&gt; E1986[ 1986: Trax Records established, Chicago house distribution started ]E1986 --&gt; F1987[ 1987: British acid house boom begins ]F1987 --&gt; G1988[ 1988: Detroit techno exchange, international network formation ]G1988 --&gt; H1990[ 1990: Chicago House's global recognition, expansion of club/festival culture ]Chapter 10: Modern House and Chicago’s LegacyIt has evolved into modern deep house and tech house, and is being reevaluated at clubs and festivals. Chicago house rhythms are deeply engraved in urban culture and people’s bodies, influencing modern electronic music, club culture, and even pop music production methods. Cultural significance as heritage Symbols of urban culture: Cultures born from the background of urban space, people’s lives, and social conditions Expression of social minorities: Clubs function as cultural refuges and spaces of expression Evolution and spread of music technology: TR-808, TB-303, samplers, digital recording technology International influence: Penetration of club culture in the UK/Europe, Japan and BrazilOutlook for the futureChicago house is more than just a musical genre from the past; it continues to influence future club culture and music production as an intersection of urban culture, social movements, technology, and music. A new generation of artists samples classic songs from the past and reinterprets them into modern rhythms. Due to urban redevelopment and advances in digital technology, the physical and virtual experiences of club spaces will become more diverse. The ideals of social inclusion and diversity are rooted in Chicago House’s concept of a “free and safe space of expression. ” Final Chapter: Chicago’s Beats ForeverChicago House is the story of a small musical laboratory born out of an abandoned urban warehouse that expanded into a global cultural phenomenon. The nightly creations that took place at the Warehouse and The Power Plant were spaces of self-expression for black and LGBTQ+ communities, and symbols of urban community-building. The fusion of groove and technology forged by pioneers like Frankie Knuckles and Larry Heard became more than just music, it became a cultural movement. Its influence extends to British acid house, Detroit techno, modern EDM and deep house, and Chicago beats continue to live on in clubs around the world today. Chicago house is both a legacy of the past and a beacon for the musical culture of the future.

    "title": "[Column] Ben Frost and acoustic architecture: Between noise and structure",
    "body": "Ben Frost and Acoustic Architecture - Frequency Violence      Text: mmr   Theme: Redefining the sublime in the digital age by Ben Frost   When many listeners hear Ben Frost’s music for the first time, the first thing they notice is not volume, but density. It’s not just a loud noise. Sound expands the space itself, compresses it, and exists as if to take away its breath. For Frost, who is originally from Australia and lives in Iceland, sound is a physical phenomenon and a form of violence. It is constructed as an architectural and tactile experience that goes beyond melody and rhythm. “Sound is a sculpture of air, a pressure acting on the body,” he says. The silence of Iceland and the roughness of AustraliaHis work has a coexistence of Icelandic tranquility and Australian wilderness. In a quiet landscape on the outskirts of Reykjavik, he creates excessive distortion and deep bass. In collaboration with Bedroom Community’s Valgeir Sigurðsson and Nico Muhly,It created a tense tension between classical structure and electronic destruction. 2009’s ““By the Throat’’ is a truly symbolic work. Here, sounds growl, breathe, and attack like beasts. Field recordings of wolf howls, breathing sounds, and low-frequency growls. These are not environmental sounds, but are organized as “attacking sounds. ” Sound as a weapon, sound as a ritualWhen discussing Frost’s acoustic philosophy, one cannot ignore the perspective of ““weaponizing sound. ’’He uses sub-bass and distortion to precisely design sonic violence. Through collaboration with Hildur Guðnadóttir, Tim Hecker and others,We explored how sound crosses the boundary between “pain” and “pleasure. ” In his works, the listener’s body becomes a “resonator”. The abdominal cavity, skin, and bones listen, not the ears. Sound surrounds the listener like air pressure that fills a space. It’s more of a ritual than music. There comes a moment when a series of sounds expands consciousness and transforms reality. The battlefield of the studioBen Frost’s production environment is more like a battlefield than just a recording studio. A plethora of modular synths, modified mics, and over-the-top compressors. Instead of “recording” the sound, you grasp it as if you were punching it. He doesn’t reject chance, but at the same time says, “Every frequency has a reason for its existence. ”Noise and distortion are not useless. Field-recorded wind sounds and vibrations,When it begins to take on an architectural structure through electronic processing,It turns into Sound Architecture. Cinematic Turn: Score for ShadowsSince the 2010s, Frost’s activities have expanded into film and drama music. Scores such as ““Fortitude”, ““Dark”, and ““Raised by Wolves’’ areRather than being a sound to incite fear, it functions as a sound that shapes the space of the story itself. There is almost no melody in his scores. What exists instead is the ““pressure” of space and the ““duration” of breathing. Ben Frost acts as a “sound architect” in the video. The bass that echoes in the darkness is like the heartbeat of the city,It evokes the “memory of silence” that humans have lost in civilization. Explosion of light: A U R O R A and the criticality of soundA U R O R A, released in 2014, was a watershed moment in Ben Frost’s career. With this work, he abandoned his previous “acoustic + electronic sound” approach,I built a world almost entirely with electronic sound particles. The drum set and guitar disappeared, replaced by pulses flashing at the speed of lightFragments of metallic noise depict a cosmic space. Steve Albini’s mix is ​​surprisingly dry;The reverberation of the sound is removed to visualize the “oxygen-free acoustics” that Frost intended. “A U R O R A” is based on my experience in Congo, Africa. It was inspired by extreme physical conditions such as sunlight, heat, and the instability of electricity. It is the violence of light, the construction of sound by photons. After this album, his sound became more and more architectural and inorganic. At the same time, it began to pulse like a living organism. A U R O R A can be said to be a work that truly captures the moment when sound becomes light. Bodies, Machines, and SacrednessFor live performances, Frost keeps lighting to a minimum;Transform the stage into a ritual space of light and noise. Extreme sound pressure, low frequency undulations, white light. They numb the audience’s senses and turn them into a sacred experience. The structure resembles a Laibach, a Swans, or even a religious ceremony. “The calm that lies beyond excess”——Frost finds a kind of relief in that. The collapse of time and the digital abyssIn recent years, Frost has been using AI composition and real-time processing toHe is interested in the “uncontrollable autonomy of sound. ” The sound leaves his hands and changes in a self-generated manner. Tarkovsky and William Gibson-like vision of the future. There is a poetics of decayed technology and reverberation. Frost’s sound attempts to redefine the sublime in the digital age. It’s like an architect trying to maintain a structure without fear of collapse. Toward a new acoustic ecosystemUltimately, Ben Frost isn’t looking at the boundary between nature and man-made. Rather, it is a ““new ecosystem’’ that will be born in the interim. Electronic sounds do not imitate nature, but become the language of nature itself. Noise is not destruction, but the voice of the environment. He says:  “The act of listening is a sense of survival. ” Sound is no longer entertainment or art. It is a ““physiological tool’’ that allows humans to reconnect with the world.

    "title": "[Column] 10-inch temptation: The aesthetics of sound told by the format",
    "body": "“Intermediate format” of 10 inchesText: mmr｜Theme: Neither 7 inches nor 12 inches. The aesthetics of sound and memories of the times told by the 10-inch medium format 10 inch record. There is a certain ambiguity in that word. It has a unique yet half-finished presence that is different from the immediate effect of a 7-inch single or the satisfying feeling of a 12-inch LP. If we look at the history of records, we can see how this “intermediate format” marked a turning point in the times. 10 inches is not just a matter of size. It was also another philosophy that redefined ““length of time” and ““density of sound. ” The restriction of around 10 minutes per side forced artists and engineers to choose ““condensation,’’ and the result was a surprisingly well-defined sound and a listening experience that required concentration. “Just long enough to take a drink by the time you finish listening. ”The aesthetics of 10 inches resides in this sense of time. 10-inch as a history of technology: Balance of rotation speed, groove width, and sound qualityThe appeal of the 10-inch cannot be explained simply by being “in between the sizes. ”It is built on an exquisite balance both physically and acoustically. Born in the early 1950s between 33⅓ rpm LP and 78 rpm SP, the 10-inch record had a recording time of about 10 to 12 minutes per side. This length corresponded to the most natural “performance unit” in jazz and classical sessions at the time. A time that can easily accommodate a full set performance. This is one of the reasons why many labels adopted 10-inch before moving to 12-inch. Furthermore, the small board surface reduces internal distortion, making the rise of the sound clearer. Among cutting engineers, it is often said that the 10-inch sound has a core. This characteristic was especially effective for music that emphasizes the freshness of the midrange rather than the extension of the low range. 1950s 10-inch Golden Age: The Experimental Ground for Jazz and Classical MusicThe 10-inch was at its peak during the dawn of jazz in the early 1950s. Labels like Blue Note, Prestige, and Clef confined artists’ experimentation to the 10-inch format. Miles Davis “Young Man with a Horn” (1952), Thelonious Monk “Thelonious Monk Trio” (1954), Charlie Parker “Now”s the Time” (1953). All of these works were like ““short films’’ that sought the best composition within the constraints of 10 inches. Before the advent of the 12-inch LP, the 10-inch was the testing ground for the new concept of “LP. ” At a time when the format for long-length works had not yet been determined, the 10-inch format gave the artist a sense of ““cohesion” and at the same time left behind the density of a ““cut out moment”. What cannot be overlooked is the evolution of jacket design. Blue Note, which preceded the appearance of Reid Miles, was known for its simple compositions that made use of typography and photo margins, but the golden ratio was most beautifully expressed in the 10-inch era. The return of the forgotten size: in the context of punk, alternative and indieEventually, 12-inch LPs dominated the market, and 10-inches were relegated to the margins of history. However, in the 1980s, the punk and indie trends brought the format back. The reason was simple. “More than a 7-inch and lighter than an LP. ”Production costs are kept low and distribution is easy. Furthermore, the strange size created a ““DIY” feel and a ““limited edition” feel. Sonic Youth”s “Death Valley “69” and Pavement’s “Watery, Domestic”. All of them appeared in 10-inch format, presenting an “aesthetics as a product” including artwork. When Radiohead released Com Lag (2plus2isfive) on a 10-inch, they had a clear intention. It”s not a full album, it”s not a single. The 10-inch has regained meaning as the perfect medium for bands to share their experimental side with listeners. 10-inch culture in Japan: minimalism and craftsmanshipIn Japan, 10-inch discs are often treated as “rare discs. ”However, because of its scarcity, it creates a special attachment to it. The precision technology of Toyo Kasei and other domestic press plants shows its true value in delicate formats like 10 inches. The silence of the board, the smoothness of the hands, and the color of the print. Each one is the result of a craftsman’s sensitivity. In recent years, an increasing number of artists have chosen 10-inch discs, such as Haruomi Hosono”s [10-inch reissue] (https://amzn. to/4nMnl7a), Tabito Nanao [ ”Little Melody”] (https://amzn. to/46SV7QE), and Shintaro Sakamoto [ ”God of Disco”] (https://amzn. to/4oaCpen). It”s not just nostalgia, but an act of redesigning “listening time. ” “It’s short, but intense. ”The Japanese aesthetic of “ma” naturally blends into the 10-inch format. Redefining physical media: 10-inch future format philosophyIn these days of streaming, the differences in format should have nothing to do with the sound. However, the existence of a 10-inch camera shakes that assumption. Short playback time encourages concentration. Small size creates intimacy. Physical constraints, on the other hand, highlight the contours of the act of “listening. ” When we pick up a 10-inch camera, we are also picking up “time. ”It is a music experience that is conscious of the end, unlike a playlist that flows endlessly due to an algorithm. Drop the needle and turn the board over. This series of actions is the ““aesthetics of inefficiency’’ that the 10-inch speaks to today. Final chapter: Time in the palm of your hand, the 10-inch ““density of sound’’10 inches is incomplete yet complete. It’s not a long story or a short story, but a “short story” format. Music in the palm of your hand. However, its density is not inferior to 12 inches. A format is not just a container, but an idea. Re-evaluating the 10-inch is an act of reconsidering the way music is listened to. There is always a ““middle’’ between technologies. It is in this ambiguity that the freedom of expression and spirit of experimentation resides. The 10-inch size quietly tells us this.

    "title": "[Column] 10-inch record technology supplement: The truth about groove width, rotation speed, and mastering",
    "body": "10-inch design concept: precision in the medium of formatText: mmr｜Theme: Delving into the technical background of 10-inch records, such as their structure, rotation speed, and mastering, and reconsidering the uniqueness of the sound produced by the format. The physical structure of a record embodies the philosophy of the musical format in its purest form. The 10-inch disc is a format that is particularly ““designally middle-of-the-road. ’’A board with a diameter of 25 cm exhibits intermediate characteristics between 7 inches and 12 inches in terms of linear groove speed, groove width, and rotational speed. What this means is that here is the optimal solution for the trade-off between playback time and sound quality. The 10-inch size exists at a “beautiful balance point” with few design constraints. Rotation speed and linear velocity: physical laws that determine the “momentum” of soundOne of the factors that determines the sound quality of a record is the number of revolutions (RPM) and linear velocity.    7 inch single: 45RPMThere is a lot of force in the sound at the outer periphery, and excellent reproduction of high frequencies. However, distortion increases at the inner circumference.     12 inch LP: 33⅓RPMIt is suitable for long-term playback and ensures stable sound quality, but the high frequencies are somewhat subdued.     10 inch LP: 33⅓RPM or 45RPMThe limit is about 12 minutes per side at 33⅓, and about 8 to 9 minutes at 45 RPM. In other words, the strength of the 10-inch is that it is possible to design a system that prioritizes sound quality over time.  The average linear velocity is approximately 15% higher than that of 12 inches, and there is less distortion on the inner periphery. Especially in music with a strong attack, such as jazz or indie rock, this speed characteristic creates a clear sense of rhythm and spatial separation. Groove width and cutting level: Tug of war between sound pressure and playback timeThe groove width on an analog record is proportional to the amplitude (dynamics) of the sound. In other words, the louder the sound, the shorter the playing time. On a 12-inch disc, there are approximately 250 to 300 grooves per inch, but on a 10-inch disc, when sound pressure is a priority, the number of grooves is often kept to around 200. As a result, the sound groove is thicker and the “edge” of the sound is emphasized. Due to this structural feature, 10-inch discs exhibit the following acoustic trends:  Good sound pressure and clear low-frequency attack Tight midrange localization High range is slightly rough, but has momentumThis characteristic makes it suitable for live recordings and rough mixes, and this is why artists who choose 10-inch discs emphasize experimentation. Mastering process: from lacquer to stamperThe key point in the 10-inch record production process is the lacquer cutting stage. Due to the smaller diameter of the 10-inch disc, there is less cutting head tracking error. This improves the accuracy of the sound groove and makes stereo localization more stable. Main process overview   PremasteringOptimize your digital or analog sources for lacquer. Adjust sound pressure, stereo width, and phase.     Lacquer CuttingCarve grooves on a 10-inch lacquer board. Groove width and pitch control are important. “Within 12 minutes at 33⅓RPM” is one of the design criteria.     ElectroformingCopy with nickel in the order of master → mother → stamper. 10 inch has a lower deformation rate than 12 inch and has a better press yield.     PressingDomestic presses such as Toyo Kasei control plate surface temperature and pressure in millimeter units. This process is especially important for 10-inch models because the stability of the molding is directly linked to the sound quality.  Press material and weight: 180g Behind the mythFor 10-inch discs, the thickness is generally around 1. 8 to 2. 0 mm, and the weight is approximately 120 to 150 g. Influenced by the boom in 12-inch 180g heavy discs, we tend to think that “heavier means better sound quality,” but in reality, the density and flatness of the material are more important. The small size of the 10-inch board naturally increases the rigidity of the entire board, making it less likely to warp and cause less resonance. In other words, even if it is thin, the sound is tight. For this reason, there is almost no disadvantage in terms of sound quality even with a lightweight 10-inch disc. 10-inch “density” from an acoustic measurement perspectiveFrom an acoustic measurement perspective, the playback frequency characteristics of 10-inch discs show the following trends.       Bandwidth   Average S/N ratio   Notes         40Hz to 100Hz   +2dB   Stronger low frequency peak, tighter       1kHz to 4kHz   ±0dB   Flat, clear       8kHz or higher   −1 to 2 dB   High frequency attenuation is rather fast (physical constraints)   This characteristic results in a sound image with a “close feeling” centered around the midrange. The reason why 10-inch discs are said to have a ““live sound’’ is because of the high density of the midrange. 33⅓ or 45: Philosophy of format selectionFor 10-inch discs, the big decision at the production stage is whether to use 33⅓RPM or 45RPM. The selection criteria are as follows:  33⅓RPM: Focus on recording time. Ideal for EPs and small albums.  45RPM: Focus on sound quality and dynamics. For maxi singles and audiophiles. What’s interesting is that the 10-inch 45RPM disc has a more “condensed sound image” than the 12-inch 45RPM disc. This is due to the physical phenomenon that the winding speed of the groove is fast, so the low range comes to the front. As a result, club and noise artists often choose the 10-inch 45RPM. Mastering Philosophy: Technique to “carve a work” in a limited time10-inch cutting is not just a technique, but also an ““editing aesthetic. ’’Because time is limited, it is important to decide which sounds to keep and which to cut out. This feeling is similar to editing a movie or cropping a photo. There is also a movement among modern mastering engineers to seek a “10-inch optimized sound image. ”It is no longer a format of the past, but a 10-inch device of new time design. Conclusion: Musical philosophy in the physics of a diskWhen talking about the appeal of 10-inch discs in technical terms, what stands out behind it is the ““freedom created by constraints. ’’Design limitations, time constraints, and size limitations. All of this makes the music “condensed” and restores its “feel. ” The format is philosophy, engineering, and poetry. 10 inches is located at the point where these three intersect most closely. In that moment when the tip of the needle traces the groove, we see the spirit of music in the physics.

    "title": "[Column] Noise Desert: From the 2000s Texas Scene to the Present",
    "body": "Prologue: Between Silence and Roar — Grammar of Noise in the SouthText: mmr｜Theme: From Charalambides to Black Leather Jesus, tracing the genealogy of southern experimental sound—Texas noise in the 2000s and its current state It was from the late 1990s to the early 2000s that noise music took root in the vast landscape of the American South. While New York and Los Angeles were ““art cities’’ that developed noise music in art galleries and underground clubs, Texas developed its grammar as a place of geographic isolation and personal experimentation. Houston, Austin, and San Antonio—these cities may be the ““homelands of country and blues’’ on the surface, but behind the scenes tape collage, non-music, and drone were quietly being cultivated. Chapter 1: Solitary Sound Experiments — Charalambides and the Expansion of Southern ConsciousnessIn the early 2000s, Charalambides (Christina and Tom Carter) were a mainstay of the Texas noise scene. Their sound wasn’t so much noise as it was an experimental ritual that explored the ““junior edge’’ of folk and drone.  Infinitely stretched guitar reverberation Vocal phrase repeated like a prayer Harmonic structure that can only be achieved by passing through the dry Texas air “It’s like recording the scenery itself, not the music. ”— Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth) Charalambides’ activities spread through the Kranky and Wholly Other labels, and had a great influence on later Texas noise artists. Chapter 2: Noise of Iron and Flesh — Black Leather Jesus and the Genealogy of PhysicalityBlack Leather Jesus (BLJ), which has been active since the 1990s, is a Houston-based noise group led by Richard Ramirez. BLJ continued to be active in the 2000s and beyond as the ““extreme of harsh noise”’, along with Japan”s Hijikaido, MERZBOW, and America’s The Haters. BLJ is characterized by its fusion of noise, flesh, and homosexual aesthetics. Their stages feature restraints, leather, and religious rituals, accompanied by physical explosions of noise. It was more than a sonic experiment, it was a body-mediated resistance and celebration. Offshoot units such as Werewolf Jerusalem and The Rita also sprang up around BLJ, turning Texas noise culture into an underground empire. Chapter 3: From drones to ambient sounds — the connection between Austin and art noiseAustin is the city in Texas where noise has taken on new directions, especially as a hotbed of college culture and DIY art. In the late 2000s, artists like Iron Lung, Pure Ground, and Digital Leather shifted their focus from harshness to minimalism. The recording environment has also changed. Cassette labels were on the rise, and exchanges with countries such as Edition Mego and Hospital Productions were also progressing. A characteristic of this period was the redefinition of noise as art. In particular, the “No Idea Festival” was held in small galleries and warehouses in Austin. Recognized Texas noise culture as part of an international avant-garde music network. Chapter 4: Noise after Noise — Developments after the 2010sIn the 2010s, noise changed from “extreme acoustic expression” to “structural thinking. ”Artists from Texas are breaking new ground by mixing ambient, electroacoustic, field recording, and more. As a typical example:  Tom Carter’s solo work “Long Time Underground” (2015) Rick Reed’s tape works (core of the Austin electronic sound scene) Poetics of Memory and Noise using loop cassettes by Amulets (Randall Taylor)These movements no longer consider noise as “destructive music” but as the noise of time and existence. Chapter 5: Current Location and Future of Modern Texas NoiseThe Texas noise scene of the 2020s lies between the network and the land. While young artists from Houston and Dallas are active as a digital collective through Bandcamp, YouTube, Discord, etc. Older artists continue to work with analog equipment.  “Noise is not about technology, it’s about attitude. ”— Richard Ramirez (Black Leather Jesus) Texas noise continues to oscillate between wild and urban. It could be called “Southern literature through sound”.

    "title": "[Column] Roland TR-1000: Redefining rhythm ─ Analog genes and the heartbeat of the AI ​​era",
    "body": "When Roland rewrites the “definition of rhythm machine” againText: mmr｜Theme: TR-1000, the latest product in the TR series released by Roland. Thoroughly dig into its analog circuit design, AI behavior, and cultural meaning from the three axes of technology, ideology, and cultural history. Roland’s new heartbeat, the TR-1000, is a “Rhythm Creator” that combines the warmth of analog, the precision of digital, and the freedom of sampling. This article will unravel its technical core, ideological background, and position in music culture. Chapter 1 “The rhythm machine is not finished”── The incident of the appearance of TR-1000The TR-1000 released by Roland in 2025 is not just an extension of the series. 808, 909, 707… This machine that appeared at the end of history, where they symbolized the groove of the times, is an ““intellectual rhythm machine” that learns and reinterprets ““human sense of beat. ” In the 1980s, electronic rhythms were called the “mechanical heartbeat. ” However, what the TR-1000 presents is the opposite – “a machine understands the human heartbeat”. Digital and analog, AI and emotions. On this border lies the philosophy that Roland has spent half a century cultivating.  “Rhythm is the act of making time sound. But what if time itself could be played?”— From Roland development interview Chapter 2 Design philosophy: Analog reconstruction and intelligent control─ ““While drawing the blood of 808 and 909, we exceed them. ’’The TR-1000 restructures the ACB (Analog Circuit Behavior) technology that Roland has cultivated and models the very “behavior” of analog circuits. The module structure allows each circuit to be individually controlled, making it possible to vary the tone, overtones, and drive feel in real time. Furthermore, the AI ​​learns thousands of patterns from past TR series and generates ““natural groove candidates’’ based on user interaction. This mechanism is not just randomization. It sequentially analyzes a player”s operation history and rhythmic tendencies, and re-presents that person”s unique time feel as “resonance. ”The TR-1000 is, so to speak, a ““rhythm mirror image device. ’’ Chapter 3 Physical Design and Interface── Regaining the feeling of “playing” a machineThe panel design of the TR-1000 follows the traditional layout of the 808/909, but combines a metallic texture with a modern layout. Machined aluminum knob, step button with rounded edges. This tactile design is an expression of the belief that ““the hands remember the music before they can express the sound. ’’ The sequencer has 12 tracks and up to 128 steps, and the snapshot function instantly saves all settings. The “Morph” knob changes multiple parameters at once, including timbre, decay, and tuning, allowing the rhythm to evolve over time. Responsiveness as if the rhythm was “breathing”. This is why Roland is so particular about its hardware. Chapter 4 Acoustic structure: Evolution of low frequencies and rhythmic texture── To overcome the “ghost of the 808 kick”At the heart of the TR-1000 is a low-end design philosophy. A unique sub-oscillation and harmonic control circuit has been added to the sine wave generation circuit, which continues the tradition since the 808. As a result, we have achieved a ““three-dimensional low frequency’’ that combines physical pressure and the texture of air. The snare is constructed using a discrete circuit + noise shaping method, and the hi-hat is constructed using an analog noise source that includes a minute micro-delay. It has achieved a ““coexistence of acoustic realism and abstraction’’ that goes beyond the reproduction of the 808/909. As a result, it does not get overshadowed even in club PAs, and maintains a rich sense of separation even on studio monitors. Chapter 5 Ideological Aspects: The Intersection of Rhythm and Intelligence── From “machines for humans” to “humans dancing with machines”Roland founder Ikutaro Kakei once said:  “Electronic musical instruments are tools to expand human expression, not to replace humans. ” The TR-1000 inherits this philosophy in the context of the AI ​​era. The “Humanize” function analyzes the performance history and models the player’s habits, not just tempo fluctuations. It “learns” the rhythm of the player’s fingertips and returns it as a sound. In other words, the TR-1000 is also a ““machine that listens to human performances. ’’ This dialogue has evolved from the days when the 808 provided a “mechanical groove” to a “resonant rhythm. ” Chapter 6 Cultural Context: The Myth of the TR Series── From hip-hop to AI beatIn the 1980s, the TR-808 gave birth to hip-hop, the 909 gave birth to techno, and the 707 gave birth to house. The TR series has always stood at a turning point in music history. The TR-1000 is also carving out a new symbol in modern club culture, where AI and live performance coexist. Detroit’s DJ Bone describes the TR-1000 as a “breathing rhythm machine,” and Tokyo producer Seiho says, “Rhythm has started to have emotions. ”In a cultural context, the TR-1000 does not mean an “extension of nostalgia” but an “expansion of rhythmic consciousness. ” Chapter 7 Philosophical Consequences of TR-1000── What is “beat”?The design philosophy of the TR-1000 ultimately converges on one question. “Who makes the beat?”It’s a machine that keeps track of the tempo, but why do I feel a sense of humanity in it?Through the fusion of AI and analog, the TR-1000 has taken beats to the stage of “sharing” rather than “generating” them. Music is the expression of intelligence that resides in rhythm. This machine questions its roots and is not just a gadget. **The TR-1000 is an experimental device for the philosophy of rhythm. ** Chapter 8 Conclusion: Towards the future of rhythm── How do people sound in the age of AI dancing?The TR-1000 is neither the reincarnation of the 808 nor the rebirth of the 909. It is the embodiment of a new musical philosophy: ““Machines learn human rhythms. ’’The philosophy that Roland has cultivated over 50 years has been fused with AI technology to once again make the heartbeat of humanity resonate. The evolution of rhythm never ends. And at the center of all of this is always a human being. ** ▷ TR series main chronology (Mermaid)flowchart TDA1972[ 1972: Birth of Rhythm Ace TR-77 ]A1980[ 1980: TR-808 released ]A1983[ 1983: TR-909 released ]A1984[ 1984:TR-707/727 ]A1987[ 1987:TR-626 ]A2014[ 2014：AIRA TR-8 ]A2018[ 2018:TR-8S ]A2025[ 2025: TR-1000 introduced (AI x analog hybrid) ]A1972 --&gt; A1980 --&gt; A1983 --&gt; A1984 --&gt; A1987 --&gt; A2014 --&gt; A2018 --&gt; A2025▷ Related products/reference links      Model   Release year   Features   Representative artist   Link         TR-808   1980   A milestone in analog drums   Afrika Bambaataa / YMO   Rakuten       TR-909   1983   Analog + Digital Fusion   Daft Punk / Jeff Mills   Rakuten       TR-8S   2018   Modern ACB + Sampling   -   Rakuten       TR-1000   2025   AI x Analog Hybrid Rhythm Machine   Many new generation artists   Rakuten   “Rhythm evolves, but at its center is always the human heartbeat. ”— From Roland TR-1000 development notes Related columns🔗 [[Column] History and evolution of DTM (DAW) — How the sound production environment has changed from home to professional] (https://monumental-movement. jp/Column-Daw) 🔗 [Column] From Chicago to the world: The birth and evolution of house music 🔗 [Column] Acid House: Chemical reactions of sound and cultural transformation "

    "title": "[Column] Western horror movies and their soundtracks since 2010",
    "body": "Prologue: The Age of Silent Terror and Low FrequencyText: mmr｜Theme: From A24 to Blumhouse to AI horror–unraveling the “horror of sound” that has dominated horror films since the 2010s, from both cultural history and acoustic aesthetics. In the 2010s, horror movies have transformed into an art form that is more conscious of sound than ever before. Jump scares are a thing of the past, and instead low frequencies, environmental noise, and reverberations dominate the scares. This was also an application of the psychoacoustic discovery that hearing affects the deeper psyche more directly than vision. Horror movies of this era not only gave fear, but also ““eroded”’ the audience”s inner world through sound. At the center of this change were a new generation of production studios such as A24 and Blumhouse. Chapter 1: A24’s “terrifying new sound”The arrival of A24 elevated horror into the context of art cinema. “The Witch” (2015) is a symbol of this. The score by Mark Korven rejects melody, with a prayerful drone composed of wooden instruments and microtones that grips the audience’s nerves. Acoustic design that blurs the line between silence and noise was at the heart of the A24 aesthetic. In the following Hereditary/Hereditary (2018), Colin Stetson’s saxophonic drone creates an unusual tension. The breath sound, the resonance of the distorted reeds, the vibrations of the deep bass–these things make you feel the presence of an “invisible presence” physically. In “Midsommar” (2019) (https://amzn. to/3WzeBFe), [The Haxan Cloak] (https://amzn. to/4mV3nFT) and [Bobby Krlic] (https://amzn. to/473kC1M) fuse Nordic folk ritual music with electronic noise. Contrary to the sunny images, the sound blurred the line between celebration and madness, opening up a new frontier for horror. A24’s horror sound system shakes the audience with ““whispers” rather than ““screams. ” Chapter 2: Blumhouse Horror Sound DesignBlumhouse Productions, by contrast, amplified the fear with a low budget but detailed sound design. Joseph Bishara was in charge of the composition for ‘Insidious” (2010) and “The Conjuring’ (2013). The “wall of sound” that distorts the strings to their limits and layers white noise is like an exorcism nightmare. In Get Out (2017), Michael Abels constructs a jazz score that inverts the chord progression of Negro spirituals. The sound translates social fear = structure of racism into sound. This is a rare example of music serving a political function as part of storytelling. In [ ”The Invisible Man’’ (2020)] (https://amzn. to/48qvBVt), [Benjamin Wallfisch] (https://amzn. to/46ZWI7p) embodies the “invisible presence” with electronic sounds. The design of the negative acoustic space shines, as the moment when no sound is heard creates the greatest fear. Chapter 3: Resurrection of retro horror and analog soundIn the mid-2010s, the ’80s horror sound made a comeback. In [‘It Follows’ (2014)] (https://amzn. to/4mSiAaF), Disasterpeace visualizes the fear of being chased with cold synth-based arpeggios. The track became popular in club culture, and served as an opportunity for retro synths to be reevaluated.  ”The Guest”’ (2014) is a modern reinterpretation of John Carpenter”s electronic suspense. The retrowave wave was spreading, and Kyle Dixon &amp; Michael Stein’s score for Stranger Things set the tone. The ““fusion of nostalgia and fear’’ through electronic sounds dominated the 2010s as a sound horror aesthetic directly descended from Carpenter. Chapter 4: Sound and Silence of European Art HorrorIn addition to A24, horror films that pursue the “aesthetics of silence” have appeared in Europe. Directed by Luca Guadagnino [Suspiria (2018)] (https://amzn. to/4hee5Gs), [Thom Yorke] (https://amzn. to/4nWkJmY) created a sound of prayer and despair centered around piano and synth. This is a homage to the Goblin version Suspiria (1977), and at the same time a sonic poem of loss and rebirth. Saint Maud (2019) is a scene of silence and auditory hallucinations that seems to engulf religious madness. In Norway”s [“Thelma” (2017)] (https://amzn. to/4q6uf8J) and Sweden”s [‘Border’ (2018)] (https://amzn. to/48W9tCu), icy drone sounds reproduce the Scandinavian cold. Silence, environmental sounds, breathing—these create a religious fear that goes beyond the visual. Chapter 5: Fusion of horror x electronic music cultureElectronic musicians like Oneohtrix Point Never, Ben Frost, and Mica Levi entered the scene from the “outside” of horror sound and changed film music. Ben Frost”s “Dark” series and “Super Dark Times’ (2017) create an aural sense of unease with drone and distortion. Mica Levi’s  ”Under the Skin’’ (2013) presents the feeling of an alien foreign body as a deviation from the musical scale. Furthermore, horror soundtracks are recirculated as analog records,Death Waltz and Waxwork Records re-evaluated horror music as a ““listening cultural heritage’’. The phenomenon of club DJs incorporating horror soundtracks into their sets has become widespread. It was a time when film music and club culture were intertwined in a strange way. Chapter 6: Asian Horror Internationalization and Sound LocalityThe unique horror sound is attracting attention in Asia as well. In The Wailing (2016/Korea), folk ritual music blurs the line between fear and prayer. Japanese horror sound ── Kenji Kawai (“Ring”) and Hiroshi Takahashi”s method—It was passed down to the world as a fear etiquette using silence and environmental sounds. As Netflix titles consolidate the global market,The ““sound folklore’’ of each region is gaining a new position in global horror. Sound transcends language. Fear needs no translation. Chapter 7: AI and the future of horror audio ”Skinamarink’’ (2022) is a new-age horror film composed of household camera noise and spatial distortion. Sound is hardly music, but merely “reverberations. ”But it is that missing sound that evokes the most human fears. AI-generated music is already venturing into the realm of horror sound. Using deep learning to imitate human fear reactions,It is now possible to generate uncanny valley sounds that make you feel that something is wrong. From surround sound in movie theaters to spatial sound in earphones──Fear is no longer confined to the ears of individuals. Final chapter: Fear is audible — the cultural significance of modern horror audioIn horror films since 2010, sound has gone beyond mere presentation and has become a medium that questions the very existence of the film. Colin Stetson”s bass breath, Disasterpeace”s electronic tension, Bobby Krlic’s ritualistic rhythm. All of these are acoustic translations of the question, “What is fear?” The sounds of horror resonate with social anxiety and individual loneliness. It is also music that aims to regain the ““deep emotion’’ that pop music has lost. The next generation of horror composers already has an ear for turning horror into art.

    "title": "[Column] Wrong Way Up and \"The Beach\"—Reverberations of utopia and the other side of civilization",
    "body": "Prologue: Those heading south — the modern “paradise” fantasy      Text: mmr   Theme: Exploring the sounds of utopia and escape through Brian Eno &amp; John Cale’s “Wrong Way Up” and “The Beach” starring Leonardo DiCaprio   At the end of the 1990s, the world still believed in the word “paradise. ” The end of the Cold War, the birth of the Internet, and dreams of globalization. However, cracks were already appearing behind that dream. Brian Eno and John Cale”s ““Wrong Way Up” (1990) and Leonardo DiCaprio”s ““The Beach” (2000) stand on opposite ends of that chasm. Both stories are about heading south. It depicts the loneliness and disillusionment that lurks in the attempt to find paradise at the end of escape. “Wrong Way Up” oscillates between electronic sounds and melodies as it unfolds an “inner journey. ” ““The Beach” depicts the ““collapse of a community” in the depths of a tropical landscape. Paradise is no longer a place, but a projection of the mind. Chapter 1: The Miracle of Collaboration—Eno and Cale, the intersection of two brainsIn the 1970s, Eno left Roxy Music and became a leader in experimental music. John Cale, on the other hand, had left the Velvet Underground’s influence and drifted between classical and avant-garde. Throughout the 1980s, the two felt distant from each other, but finally met in a London studio in 1990. Wrong Way Up is an album that perfectly combines Eno”s ambient sonic thinking with Cale”s architectural drama. During recording, the two often clashed. Eno”s idea of ​​”shaving down” and Cale”s “building up” nature clashed head-on. But that tension breathes life into the sound. The floating feeling of “Spinning Away,” the layered rhythm of “One Word,” and the transparent anxiety of “Empty Frame. ”Everything was a product of “cooperation and friction. ”  “You don”t collaborate to agree. You collaborate to discover. ” — Brian Eno Chapter 2: “Another Journey” called “Wrong Way Up”The title “Wrong Way Up” has a double meaning. It is a sense of discomfort in an ““upside down world,” and at the same time, it is an allegory for ““a mind that wanders as it ascends. ” Sonically, Eno”s signature smooth ambience is infused with Cale”s melodic intent. For example, “Spinning Away” is a perfect mix of floating feelings and nostalgia. Synth particles sparkle like reflections on the ocean”s surface, and Cale”s voice evokes the idea of ​​”distant land. ”  “Up on a hill, as the day dissolves,With my pencil turning moments into line…” The melody is like a ““memory sketch. ’’This album was a forerunner of Eno’s ““environmental pop’’ from the 1990s onward, and was inherited by the sounds of Coldplay and Moby. ““False ascension’’ may refer to the path we take in what we believe is the correct path. Chapter 3: “The Beach”—A story of the collapse of a utopia in the digital ageThe 2000 film ““The Beach” by Danny Boyle summarizes the ““escapism myth” of young people at the end of the 20th century. Richard, played by DiCaprio, obtains a map of the legendary “hidden island” at a cheap hotel in Bangkok and heads to “paradise” with his friends. However, what awaits them is not happiness, but communal madness and individual collapse. Director Boyle depicts the tropical landscape as a ““dazzling reality. ’’The music on ““The Beach’’ is also impressive. The transparent chorus of All Saints “Pure Shores”, the tranquil electronic sound of Moby “Porcelain”. These were echoes of an “electronic utopia” that was an extension of “Wrong Way Up. ”  “Paradise is not a place — it”s a state of mind. ” (from “The Beach”) At the end of the movie, Richard loses his friends and returns to reality. The ““faint electronic sound” that plays at that moment echoes the boundary between beauty and loss, just like Eno &amp; Cale’s ““Wrong Ascent”. Chapter 4: The intersection of sound and image——Sound as a utopian illusionEno &amp; Cale’s music and the visuals for The Beach have a similar feel. It is “transparent impatience. ”Both have a hint of anxiety in their tropical brightness. Although the rhythmic structure of ““Wrong Way Up” is electronic, it gives the impression of ““human breathing. ”The Beach soundtrack similarly explores the balance between club beats and natural sounds. The underlying theme is the “intersection between nature and technology” and the idea of ​​Ambient = Landscape of Mind, which Eno has advocated since the 1980s.  “The idea of ​​ambient music is to make you feel part of a landscape that may not exist. ” — Brian Eno The landscape of ““The Beach’’ is also a paradise that does not exist - a simulation on the screen. Here, sound and images perfectly overlap, creating a modern ““illusion of utopia. ’’ Chapter 5: Art in the post-utopian era—what lies beyond “escape”Where will we run to in the 21st century?In an era where social media connects the world and AI plays a part in imagination, the phrase “Wrong Way Up” rings even more realistic. ““False ascension’’ is now a metaphor for civilization. Eno &amp; Cale’s album had a premonition of “music after giving up on paradise. ”The melody asks quietly. “If you can’t find paradise, build it in music. ” The moment at the end of “The Beach” when Richard stares at his computer screen with a smile on his face. There are no more tropical lights or dreams of community. However, the ““reverberations of distant sounds’’ remain in his heart. Final chapter: The sound of the receding beach—a collaboration as a utopian reverberationThe decade from 1990 to 2000 was a time when the boundary between reality and fantasy melted. ““Wrong Way Up” and ““The Beach” document this change both audibly and visually. Eno and Cale’s collaboration was just a fleeting chemistry, but it left a lasting impression. It was not ““music seeking paradise,” but ““a prayer after losing paradise. ” Their sounds come and go like waves. And in our hearts, we continue to quietly draw a unseen beach.

    "title": "[Column] Autechre: Beyond structure — Acoustic architecture after techno",
    "body": "Prologue: Organic in the inorganic      Text: mmr   Theme: Autechre by Sean Booth and Rob Brown. Tracing the evolution of its acoustic structure, technological innovation, and cultural-historical significance   Autechre is more than just an electronic music duo. Their sound is both mathematical and raw. It looks cold and leaves a somewhat human roughness. Sean Booth and Rob Brown, two young men who met in north Manchester, set out on a path to redefining the very structure of sound, using hip-hop and engineering curiosity as starting points. In the early 1990s, Autechre was a standout among Warp Records’ Artificial Intelligence series. They were searching for a way to ““convert mechanical sounds into emotion. ’’ Sean Booth later said in an interview:  “Techno for us is not about eliminating emotion, but expressing it through structure. ” Chapter 1: Origin and Initial Impulse — From the Eve of Rephlex to Sean Booth and Rob Brown were both born in the 1970s. As a boy, he began composing his own songs using tracker software (such as OctaMED) on an Amiga computer. Their musical roots lie in Public Enemy, Electro Funk, and B-Boy culture. The name Autechre was initially rumored to be an abbreviation for “Audio Architecture. ” His early work, Incunabula (1993), has the scent of the early days of IDM, where melodies still remain. The follow-up, ““Amber’’ (1994), captivated many listeners with its lyricism and spatiality. Combining an analog synthesizer (Roland SH-101, Oberheim Matrix-6) and a digital sampler, they created a space between human and machine.  “We didn’t forget about the dance floor. We just wanted to reimagine why our bodies move. ” Chapter 2: The era of acoustic deconstruction — “Tri Repetae” and the collapse of minimalismIn 1995, Autechre reaches a turning point. ““Tri Repetae” is the first ““structural experiment” album that breaks through the framework of IDM. The rhythm collapses, and the sound layer becomes as hard as a steel plate. They treated drum machines (Roland R8, Nord Lead) as raw material, incorporating errors and noise into the grammar of their music. The inorganic cover design by The Designers Republic also perfectly matched Autechre’s sonic world. It was also a “minimalist fusion of sight and sound. ” The release of “Tri Repetae” symbolizes a “sensory re-education” in electronic music. The question ““What is rhythm and what is music?’’ is revealed for the first time here. Chapter 3: Mathematics and Emotions — From “Chiastic Slide” to “LP5”In 1997-1998, Autechre progressed to more complex structures. Chiastic Slide (1997) is an experiment in polyrhythm and repetition. LP5 (1998) is constructed like a sound sculpture. Of particular note is the live programming with Nord Modular and MPC1000. The method of changing data in real time became the prototype for later algorithmic live music. Their music has become something to be experienced rather than something to be heard. “Fold 4, Wrap 5” from “LP5” is full of subtle lyricism in its abstractness. It was a rediscovery of emotion hidden behind the coldness.  “Emotions cannot be eliminated. As long as we are human beings. ” Chapter 4: Life inside an algorithm — “Confield” and “Draft 7. 30”2001”s “Confield” was Autechre”s full-fledged introduction of Max/MSP. From this period, they adopted a method in which sounds were automatically generated using a self-made algorithm, and humans intervened. Sean Booth says, ““It’s less about composing and more about coordinating occurrences. ’’ “Confield” confused many listeners. Rhythm and melody no longer exist in the traditional sense. However, the more I listen to it, the more a strange ecosystem-like order emerges. In ““Draft 7. 30” (2003), the precision of the program was further increased, and the ““intelligence” of electronic music was honed to the utmost. Chapter 5: Complicit relationship with listeners — Autechre in the live and internet eraAutechre’s live performances completely exclude visual presentation. The lights go out and the stage is dark. The audience will be enveloped in a space of pure sound. This complete inorganic nature is proof that they aim to “dominate the body with sound alone. ” In the 2010s, they released the AE_LIVE series. We recorded the sounds that the program improvised as they were, and presented a different structure for each city. Furthermore, “NTS Sessions 1–4” (2018) is a masterpiece that is over 8 hours long. This is a monumental achievement in which Autechre has built a “universe of acoustic algorithms. ”  “Improvisation is also about borrowing the thinking of a program. ” Chapter 6: The Far North of Ambient Music — After “SIGN” and “PLUS”In 2020, Autechre presents a new chapter of the two-disc set. “SIGN” and “PLUS”. The warm melody that faintly reminds me of early Autechre memories has returned. Amidst the algorithmic precision, there is a tranquil, organic fluctuation. Among listeners, it is often said that “Autechre redefined Ambient. ”The tracks on ““SIGN” sound like a machine learning ““silence. ”Their sound is always walking the middle ground between the future and nostalgia. Chapter 7: Autechre Genes — Influenced and InfluencedAlong with Aphex Twin and Squarepusher, Autechre’s influence has been deeply etched in the design philosophy of electronic music since the 21st century. Artists influenced by them include Alva Noto, Ryoji Ikeda, and Oneohtrix Point Never. Both of them explore the boundaries between “structure and emotion” and “algorithm and poetry. ” Autechre has functioned as a device that asks questions such as ““What is composition?” and ““What is a human being?” as technology advances. Even after the term IDM has been exhausted, Autechre continues to leave its ““intellectual genes’’ in modern music. Final chapter: The future of sound, the future of listeningAutechre’s music is not intended to be understood. It restructures the listener’s perception and expands the very concept of sound. Their existence preceded the question, “What is human creation?” in the age of AI.  “Humans may be using machines to listen to unknown parts of their brains. ” Autechre is still exploring the possibilities of sound beyond structure.

    "title": "[Column] Tracy Chapman: An era when the voice of stillness moved",
    "body": "“Speaking for the voiceless”      Text: mmr   Theme: Tracy Chapman is a rare artist who has continued to sing about social justice, human dignity, and quiet resistance while crossing elements of folk, soul, and blues.     ”Speaking for the voiceless”’ - this is probably one of the most appropriate words to describe Tracy Chapman”s music and life. Since her debut in 1988, she has avoided flashy productions and over-the-top production, and has continued to depict society with acoustic tones and a quiet speaking voice, and her journey deeply stirs the soul of the listener. In this article, I would like to trace her upbringing, creative process, sound technology, important relationships, and intersection with the times, and decipher why her songs still resonate today. Chapter 1 Cleveland Landscape: Birth and Origin● Sensitivity nurtured by home and environmentTracy Chapman was born on March 30, 1964 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Although his family was not wealthy, his mother loved Gospel music and would sing at church on Sundays. As a child, at the age of three, his mother gave him a ukulele, and there is an anecdote that it was his first experience with a musical instrument. She also began writing lyrics and melodies by the age of eight, and once said, ““Writing songs is like writing a diary. ’’ At one point, when he was around 14 years old, he encountered a race riot, and he recounted a shocking experience in which a gun was pointed at him and he was told to “run” and was almost shot. These experiences later led to the social awareness and focus on the weak that can be seen in “Talkin” “bout a Revolution. ” ● Between academics and musicAfter attending local schools, Chapman entered the Wooster School in Connecticut through the “A Better Chance” scholarship program. He later took his passion for music and literature to Tufts University, where he studied art and humanities while continuing his musical career. It is said that during his university days, his daily activities included live performances on campus, improvisational performances with friends, and the fusion of poetry and music. The interactions he had with the people he met during this period – university friends, local music friends, and seniors in the folk scene – became the basis for later creative networks and mutual understanding. Chapter 2 Birth of “Fast Car”: Encounter and debut● Turning point on the eve of debutIn the late 1980s, folk/acoustic singer-songwriters were somewhat outside the mainstream. However, Chapman captured the ““atmosphere’’ of the times with his quiet voice. A famous anecdote is the process leading up to the recording of her signature song “Fast Car. ” She says that at first she had a vague idea that she wanted to write a song that was like a story. He has also built a long-standing relationship with David Kershenbaum, the producer of his debut album, and is teaming up with him again for the reissue 35 years later. Her self-titled album Tracy Chapman, released in 1988, was a commercial and critical success and quickly gained attention around the world. ● Acoustic technology: challenge in simplicityWhat characterizes Chapman’s debut album is the methodology of ““capturing the vocals and acoustic guitar live. ’’One recording workshop forum states:  “Two microphones, two compressors, and 5 equalizers … took painstaking balancing so that solo vocal or solo guitar alone sounded off, but together they merged magically. ” In other words, rather than recording vocals and guitar separately, an approach was taken to mix them together while maintaining a sense of synchronization and atmosphere. They considered using DI (direct input) for the guitar, but the technology at the time had a high risk of noise and phase shift, so they focused on improving the microphone recording. Furthermore, Chapman has publicly stated that in the early stages of production, he developed the song using paper, pen, and a portable tape recorder, rather than relying on computers or digital equipment. This method was probably chosen to preserve the freshness of the creation. ● Anecdotes related to “Fast Car” ”Fast Car” is often debated as to whether it”s true or fictional, but Chapman himself says, ““It”s a story and it tells an emotional truth. ”In other words, not all of the characters in the song are herself, but they are a reflection of her. The song became an instant hit upon its release and even reached the top of the Billboard charts. The fact that the Library of Congress certified this debut album as part of America’s “National Recording Registry” also shaped its historical importance in later years. Furthermore, at the 2024 Grammy Awards, she performed “Fast Car” with Luke Combs, which once again attracted a lot of attention, showing resonance across generations. This event highlighted her strong presence in the music world, as she does not normally perform live. Chapter 3 “Talkin” “bout a Revolution”: Genealogy of silent cries● When songs go towards society“Talkin” “bout a Revolution” can be said to be a song that continues the tradition of protest songs and folk storytelling into the modern era. But Chapman has avoided calling himself a “protest singer. ” “That label limits me,” she said in an interview. However, this song contains the will to resist oppression, an eye toward social inequality, and a sense of solidarity with those who have no voice, and has the power to raise questions within the listener. ● Voices that resonate with character relationshipsChapman”s musical worlds often depict other people”s perspectives and characters’ stories. “Lyrics are not necessarily autobiographical; they are a mixture of influences, emotions, and other people’s stories,” she said. This way of speaking has an affinity with folk and blues traditions. She cites gospel, soul, and folk singers as her musical influences, and has a strong sense of forming a collective voice rather than an individual voice. ● Acoustic intention and spatialityLive and recorded versions of “Talkin” “bout a Revolution” often use light reverb in the background, making the vocals and guitar blend into the space. In order to make use of the white space in the lyrics, excessive sounds are avoided and the mixing is conscious of the “pause”. This idea is possible because her songs have a character that is similar to ““talking to people’’. In addition, in terms of recording technology, equalization is often chosen to leave the contours of the mid-low range clear, without layering the vocals or guitar too thickly. This gives the listener the illusion that the voice is reaching them directly. Chapter 4 Poetry of maturity and distance in the 90s● Comparison between Matters of the Heart and New BeginningReleased in 1992, Matters of the Heart is introspective and warm, while being less political and social. On the other hand, 1995’s New Beginning was a work that boldly incorporated blues-rock elements and expanded their musical range, thanks in part to the huge success of the single “Give Me One Reason. ” “Give Me One Reason” reached number 3 on Billboard and received multiple Grammy nominations. Chapman is said to have played this song during his 1988 tour, and it is seen as an example of a song that has matured and blossomed over time. ● Psychology and distance, inside and outsideLyrics from this period feature prominent themes such as ““distance from others,” ““inner world and real world,” and ““conflict between love and freedom. ’’For example, in one interview Chapman said:  “The songs are not necessarily autobiographical. … A lot of songs are a combination of influences. It might be some part of my life … It all comes together. ” In other words, the style of storytelling that blends personal feelings and social perspectives became more sophisticated during this period. ● Deepening of recording and productionFrom this period onwards, Chapman’s recordings introduced a greater variety of sound techniques. The depth of the song is supported by multi-track recording, overdubs, subtle introductions of strings and electronic sounds, and reverb processing that emphasizes the space. However, she always valued ““a balance that does not destroy the core of the song’’ and avoided excessive embellishments. Additionally, our relationships with producers and engineers have matured, allowing us to work collaboratively to achieve maximum effect with minimal intervention. Chapter 5 Silence and Creation in the 21st Century and Beyond● Telling Stories ~ Our Bright Future: Deepening storytellingChapman continued to release select releases into the 2000s. Although he has changed musicality and accompaniment style in 2000”s Telling Stories, 2002”s Let It Rain, 2005”s Where You Live, and 2008”s Our Bright Future, he has consistently maintained a sense of spontaneity and gentleness. For Where You Live, she was involved in the production and is said to have had an influence on the sound design. Additionally, she rarely uses streaming, instead offering her works through CDs and vinyl. This is an expression of the company’s stance of ““protecting the means by which artists can be fairly rewarded. ’’ : ● Human relationships/friendship/public presenceChapman is known for not making many public appearances, but because of this, the interaction and trusting relationships she has with her colleagues and co-stars have supported her production background. For example, there are reports that he is close friends with novelist Alice Walker, and that they had a relationship for a while, but he has not made the details of his private life public. Additionally, his performance of “Fast Car” at the 2024 Grammys symbolized his intergenerational musical connection with Luke Combs. The negotiation process for this stage was said to have been cautious, with the Grammys taking an approach that emphasized trust and avoided putting too much pressure on her. ● Silent resistance and its significanceAlthough Chapman doesn’t fully consider herself a “protest singer,” her songs always have a social eye. As she says:  “I know that I have been labeled as a protest singer, and it”s not a label that I accept … I hope everybody knows it”s not me … this is a work of fiction in that regard. ” Yet, for many listeners, her songs have been a source of empathy and resistance to injustice, inequality, and loneliness. Chapter 6 Listeners and rediscovering songs● Trends in covers and reinterpretations“Fast Car” in particular has spawned many covers, but Luke Combs” country-inspired reinterpretation has created a resurgence in the 2020s, creating a resonance between the original and new interpretations. As a result, Chapman’s songs are no longer just “famous songs from the past,” but have become something that can be passed down through generations. In addition, live performances and reconfigurations in acoustic sessions create lightness of the acoustics and re-presentation of the lyrics. ● Resonance with acoustic technology: Optimization for modern listening environmentsStreaming, high-resolution sound sources, smart speakers, headphone environments—the music environment of the 21st century is diversifying, and listeners’ listening conditions are becoming more complex. Among these, Chapman’s songs have a high level of purity that eliminates unnecessary frequencies, so it can be analyzed that the design allows for his voice to be heard in any environment. For example, equalizing to keep the midrange clear, mixing to avoid excessive boosting of the low range, and suppression of reverb and spatial processing–all of these are factors that keep her songs designed to not blend in with the noise. In addition, the approach of emphasizing the “live feeling” in the original song recording (such as the two microphones and compressor adjustment mentioned above) continues to be effective even today as “the feeling of live performance = an element that brings people closer together. ” Final Chapter: A quiet light that illuminates the darknessTracy Chapman’s songs are always made up of the trinity of ““quiet anger,” ““a close gaze,” and ““poetic distance. ’’she doesn’t scream out loud. However, each word slowly reaches deep into the heart of the listener. What she leaves behind is neither a flashy stage nor excessive production. Rather, it is a poem that cultivates ““ears that hear the voices of the voiceless,’’ a way of using time and senses, and a methodology of quiet resistance. I hope that through this column you will be able to reconsider the contours of Tracy Chapman’s world with your own sensibilities.

    "title": "[Column] The Mekons — A path of rebellion and reinvention",
    "body": "The Rebellion Begins at Leeds Art SchoolText: mmr｜Theme: From Leeds punk to the American wilderness. The Mekons’ 45-year history of music and community  “It started with laughter, not rebellion. ” 1977, University of Leeds, Northern England. The Mekons were started by students in a corner of a lecture room, jokingly thinking, ““Maybe we could form a band ourselves. ’’ Jon Langford, Tom Greenhalgh, Kevin Lycett, and others would become symbols of the post-punk culture. They had no musical skills and even borrowed instruments. At that time, punk was a revolution that anyone could start. The name Mekons is said to come from the “rebel” character in Byron’s play The Curse of Minerva. The single ““Where Were You / I’ll Have To Dance Then (On My Own)’’, released in 1978, symbolizes their early punk spirit. ““Where Were You?’’ depicts the loneliness of young people and their doubts about society with sharp guitar riffs and vocals mixed with noise. The B-side, I’ll Have To Dance Then (On My Own), expresses self-alienation and the desire for freedom with punk energy. Although the recording is rough, it is full of improvisation with friends from university, and you can see the origins of the ““aesthetics of imperfection’’ that Mekons later pursued. Along with their early single ““Never Been in a Riot,’’ this single is considered an important piece of Mekons’ early trinity of social criticism, humor, and self-exploration. At live shows at the time, it was a common sight for the audience to laugh, get confused, and sometimes get into arguments every time this song ended. Chapter 1: Escape from the rough and clumsy punk “Clumsiness was sincerity. ” Debut album released in 1979 [ ”The Quality of Mercy Is Not Strnen”] (https://amzn. to/477GZ6y). The typographical error in the title ““Stolen” itself symbolized the band’s attitude. Recorded at Virgin Studios in London. At the time, they said, ““It was the first time I had seen a mixer table. ’’The acoustics are rough, and the microphone distance and balance are unstable. Still, the howling guitar and distortion of the vocals were recorded as “creativity born out of ignorance. ” There is no producer, and the sound image is based on the DIY spirit. “We weren’t political or romantic, we were just confused,” says Jon Langford. At the time, the Mekons were conscious of ““acting”’ rather than acting out rebellion. That”s why their sound echoed the “doubt” that other punk bands had let go of. Chapter 2: Postpunk and Social Criticism “What remained after the anger was a look of observation. ” In the early 1980s, as punk became more popular, Mekons gradually changed their form. They leave London and transform into a social critique group that intersects politics and culture. In the context of the Theater of Hate and Red Wedge movements, Mekons chose “community over music. ”The members are not fixed, and friends from university days come and go, sometimes recording with as many as 10 people. Its nature as an art collective is becoming stronger. Their masterpiece in 1989 “The Mekons Rock “n” Roll” was the summation of that. A unique spatial composition with double tracking of the guitar, excessive reverb, and suppressed low frequencies of the bass. These were gimmicks intended to intentionally distort the “formal beauty of rock. ”With this album, they presented the paradox of ““Isn’t rock the system itself?’’  “We know that rock and roll is dangerous. It can destroy countries. ”— The Mekons, interview 1989 Chapter 3: Encounter with American music and the dawn of “alternative country” “Amidst the wine and dust, there was the truth. ” With 1985”s “Fear and Whiskey’, the Mekons ventured into completely new horizons. What was there was the folk and country music of the American South, as well as the feelings of ““loss of home’’ felt by postwar British society. During this period, Jon Langford rediscovered that ““country is the blues of the working class’’ while listening to Hank Williams and Merle Haggard. Recorded at Woodlands, Leeds, an indie studio at the time. The guitar, recorded directly on line to analog tape, has a natural saturation that takes advantage of the distortion of the amplifier, and room mics are often used for vocals. This lo-fi sound creates a “poetic sense of distance” rather than a “muddy smell. ”This album would later be reevaluated as a precursor to the “alt-country” genre of artists such as Uncle Tupelo and Wilco. Chapter 4: Rock and Roll as an Immigrant “Rock has no borders, but immigrants need land. ” In the 1990s, the Mekons moved to Chicago. Jon Langford deepens his collaboration with American musicians, developing other projects such as the Waco Brothers and Pine Valley Cosmonauts. Sally Timms will be collaborating with local poets and Tom Greenhalgh will be involved in video production. During this period, Mekons existed as a ““drifting artistic community’’ that transcended nationality and genre. It was said that “Mekons” music sounds like it doesn”t belong anywhere. ”Like immigrants, they moved between musical contexts, creating temporary homes there. The album [Journey to the End of the Night (2000)] (https://amzn. to/4q3A5HR) is a symbol of this, and its acoustic composition, which includes brass and violin, emphasizes its “foreignness. ”Although he used Pro Tools for this work, he purposely used an analog console for mixing, leaving a ““human imbalance. ’’ Chapter 5: Feminism and Solidarity, Perspectives of Female Members “As more voices grow, the truth becomes more divided. ” Sally Timms deserves special mention in Mekons history. When she officially joined the group in 1985, she functioned not just as a vocalist, but as a “storyteller. ”Her clear voice had the power to transform the band’s political language into poetic allegory. Sally says, “Telling a story is more powerful than shouting anger. ” With her perspective added, Mekons has been reevaluated in a feminist context. Its polyphonic nature, along with its contemporaries Raincoats and Au Pairs, is a rare example of a woman’s voice acquiring social reality. At live performances, there are many scenes where Sally reads aloud and Langford accompanies on guitar, making the Mekons’ ““music = storytelling’’ structure clear. Chapter 6: Mekons as Art — Multimedia and Documentary “Their art is a testimony and a celebration. ” The 2013 documentary film Revenge of the Mekons ​​showed the core of the movement. Director Joe Angio describes them as “living works of art. ”This work depicts how Mekons have traversed various forms of expression, including not only music but also painting, photography, poetry, and political activism. Jon Langford himself was active as a painter and presented an ““anti-romantic image of America’’ by symbolically depicting the landscapes of the American Midwest. While maintaining analog recording, their sound intentionally produces a ““roughness. ’’Langford said, ““Noise is in our blood,’’ and when recording, he preferred to remove the noise gate and leave in ambient sounds. This “scarred sound” was the realism that Mekons believed in. Chapter 7: Beyond Deconstruction and Reorganization “Even if we disband, it won”t end. Because it won”t end, it’s Mekons. ” The Mekons disbanded and reformed many times. However, it is not the end, but rather a cycle like the seasons. 2019’s “Deserted” (https://amzn. to/4nHdkYD) is a session album that the members gathered in the desert and recorded in a few days. There is a sense of the ““quiet anger’’ of these people who have reached their prime years. Acoustic guitar, electronic drone, and distant wind sounds. It sounds like a “testament of humanity. ”  “We are still here, not because we should be, but because we can be. ”— Jon Langford, 2019 Final chapter: Why did the Mekons “survive”? “Hope is collective survival. ” For over 45 years, they have rejected commercialism and sought a way to make a living outside of the music industry. It is an aesthetic of solidarity, not self-preservation. Their body of work has transcended the ideals of post-punk and has become the very practice of ““art of survival. ’’ Mekons” music isn”t perfect. But that imperfection resonates with the imperfection of the world. That’s why they still ring.

    "body": "Prologue: The dawn of Brazilian psychedelics      Text: mmr   Theme: Tracing the genealogy of psychedelic music born in Brazil, from the Tropicália movement to modern revival   In the late 1960s, political tensions and cultural experimentation coexisted in a strange way in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. While speech was increasingly controlled under the military regime, young people were inspired by British and American rock and sought new sonic freedom. At the forefront of this movement was the Tropicália movement. Along with the poet Torcato Neto and the artist Hélio Oiticica, the musical leaders were Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. With the goal of “redefining Brazilian music,” they freely fused bossa nova, samba, folklore, and rock.  “Tropicália is the tropics in our souls. ”— Caetano Veloso, 1968 In the studios of the time, ““manual overdubbing” was repeated, taking advantage of the limitations of recording equipment. ““Psychedelic sound technology” was born, including physically cutting and pasting reel-type tape and rotating the tape backwards to create reverse echoes. Chapter 1: Tropicalia and psychedelic fusionIn 1968, the compilation album Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis was released. This wasn’t just an album, it was a cultural declaration. Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Os Mutuntes, Gal Costa, Nara León, and others participated, presenting a Brazilian avant-garde that integrates sound, video, and poetry. Os Mutantes was particularly innovative. Sergio Diaz’s fuzz guitar, Rita Lee’s sweet yet provocative vocals, and improvisational noise manipulation were on par with British Pink Floyd and Soft Machine. Their 1970 album A Divina Comédia ou Ando Meio Desligado is considered a sonic turning point in the history of Brazilian music.  “Os Mutantes ate rock, swallowed bossa nova, and spit out the future. ”— Rolling Stone Brasil (1971) Chapter 2: Acoustic Revolution — Innovation in Brazilian Recording TechnologyAt the time, the recording studio Phonogram Studios (Rio) could not obtain Western-made multi-track equipment, so they adopted the artisanal method of layering two-track recorders. This restriction is the cause of the unique “bleeding” sound image. In particular, Os Mutuntes’ engineer Arnaldo Baptista built his own fuzz circuit and subtly fluctuated the pitch, recreating the hallucinatory floating sensation unique to South America. Another important innovation was the fusion of ethnic instruments and electronic sounds. Combining indigenous sounds like cavaquinho and bell imbau with Moog synths and reverse tape, Brazilian music was expanded into the ““psychedelic tropics. ’’ Chapter 3: Underground fever — the intersection of oppression and creationIn the 1970s, many of Tropicália’s central figures were exiled. However, the fire of music went underground and was alive and well in the local scene. Student bands in São Paulo and local radio in Bahia continued to share sounds through cassette tape networks. On the other hand, Clube da Esquina, based in the state of Minas Gerais, appears. Clube da Esquina, the 1972 album by Milton Nascimento and Lo Borges, is a masterpiece that fused the boundaries between psychedelic, folk, and MPB, and epitomized the ““quiet trip. ’’ Chapter 4: Modern Rebirth — The Age of Psychedelic RevivalIn the 21st century, young Brazilian bands have once again regained their “tropical illusion. ”Boogarins, Carne Doce, Glue Trip, O Terno and others bridge British and American indie rock with the hallucinogenic sounds of the 60s. In particular, Boogarins’ 2015 album “Manual” is characterized by lo-fi spatial recording using cassettes and analog mixers, and symbolizes the ““DIY psychedelia’’ of the Spotify generation.  “Our sound is humid, like the Brazilian air. ”— Dinho Almeida (Boogarins) Chapter 5: Live Review — Tropical Trance ExperienceThe Boogarins’ show at Cine Joia in São Paulo in 2018 was the moment when the ghost of Tropicália was brought back to life. Behind the stage are moving images of tropical plants, lighting that gives you a sense of humidity, and an endless guitar drone. Rather than dancing, the audience “floated”, immersed in the sound. The encore performance of “Lucifernandis” created a chaotic sound that sounded like the second coming of Os Mutantes, and the audience’s cheers shook the air. The sound staff used analog tape echoes to transform the entire hall into a sea of ​​hallucinatory reverberations.

The ““Tropical Vision’’ still echoes somewhere in the world.  “Psychedelia is looking at the reality within your mind. ”— Gilberto Gil "

    "body": "“What is Ween?”      Text: mmr   Theme: Boognish, a strange god born in a suburban garage in America. From its descent to lo-fi alchemy and deep-sea mythology, The Mollusk, trace the musical universe drawn by the strange brothers Ween.     A garage tucked away in the suburbs of America. From that darkness, a god was born - Boognish. ——This is music itself that jumps across genres while laughing. Boognish’s smile contains pieces of music from all over the world. The Weird Brother Myth of Ween — A Counterattack from the American SuburbsThe advent of Boognish, the god of polypropyleneA quiet residential area in Pennsylvania in the mid-1980s. Two boys grab a cassette tape and a 4-track recorder and begin a strange ritual. Aaron Freeman (Gene Ween) and Mickey Melchiondo (Dean Ween). The “Boognish” that they created is more than just a logo or character. A fictional god of laughter and madness, he was a symbol of Ween’s music itself. The noises, strange voices, and unusual key changes that were scattered throughout the home recordings were all blessed by Boognish.  “Boognish isn”t a joke. He”s everything we do. ”— Dean Ween Interview, 2003 Gene and Dean — imaginary brothers or spiritual doubles?Gene and Dean. Although the sound of their names suggests “brothers,” they are not related by blood. But musically, they were almost like twins. Gene is the embodiment of emotion and chaos, Dean is the master of construction and craft. The moment the two collide, the chaos and magic that is typical of Ween is born. “The Pod” (1991) uses a cheap microphone and an old four-track“Dirty Beauty” rules. Distorted vocals, muffled drums,Still, the whole thing was perfectly Ween. It’s as if Boognish was living inside the equipment. Alchemy in the lo-fi era — 1980s-early 1990s “I wanted a sound that sounded like it was playing in a basement at 3am. ”— Gene Ween, 1992 Interview The universe created by cassette recordersThe early Ween sound was the magic of home recording on 4-track cassette MTR. Leaves noise and distortion intact. It wasn’t “filth”, it was “truth”. Their home recordings are a kind of lo-fi alchemy. The Pod is a bizarre mix of morbid laughter and psychedelic structure. It made listeners feel uneasy while at the same time giving them an addictive feeling of pleasure. Contact with the underground sceneIndie labels like Homestead and Shimmy Disc picked up Ween’s madness. Their sound sources spread like underground circulation and ended up in the hands of eccentrics. During this period, Ween lived “between pranks and experimental music. ”  ”Chocolate and Cheese’’: The tipping point between vulgarity and highbrow “Genre doesn’t matter. I just throw in all the music I like. ”— Dean Ween, 1994 Interview 1994’s “Chocolate and Cheese” (https://amzn. to/46LSWQo)It”s Ween”s first masterpiece out of the lo-fi cave and into the studio. Pop, funk, country, progressive rock, soul… everything collides,Vulgar and noble miraculously coexist. The sensual groove of “Voodoo Lady”The false nostalgia of “Freedom of “76”. They are born from the same heart. ““It makes me laugh, but it also makes me cry. ’’ This antinomy was the core of Ween. When MTV featured “Push th” Little Daisies”American viewers were confused. Is this a gag? Is he a genius?The answer can still remain vague. Because Ween was both. Country nostalgia and strange orthodoxy — “12 Golden Country Greats” “I’m not making fun of country music. I seriously love it too much. ”— Dean Ween, 1996 Interview “12 Golden Country Greats” isA “fake country” album consisting of only 12 songs. But the people playing were real Nashville session musicians. Ween is collapsing the country format with them,He has created a masterpiece that dances between affection and irony. The sound is both funny and warm enough to bring tears to your eyes. Band Mode and the Deep Sea Myth of “The Mollusk” “The ocean is limitless. We want our music to be like that too. ”— Gene Ween, 1997 Interview “The Mollusk” isThis was the moment when Ween’s musical universe expanded to its richest. A monumental piece of psychedelic pop with ocean mythology as its theme, led by “Ocean Man”. Brian Wilson”s romance and Captain Beefheart”s madness,It”s an album that feels like it”s enclosed in a single shell. All recordings are analog using 16-track tape. Even the fluctuations of noise were controlled as music, creating a pseudo-seafloor sound. Effects like guitar echoes, vocal overtones, and the sound of the sea. The sound itself tells the myth of the deep sea. Maturation and collapse as a touring bandLive Ween was complete chaos. ““Live in Toronto 1996’’ ignores the order of the songs. Laughter and noise collide, and the boundaries with the audience melt. It was more like a ritual than a band.  “Every show is an accident waiting to be beautiful. ”— Dean Ween, 1997 However, behind the scenes, there were conflicts between alcohol, drugs, fatigue, and friendship. In 2008, Gene Ween left the band for personal reasons. He overcame his alcohol dependence and began a quiet path to recovery. Dean formed The Dean Ween Group and connected the spirit of Ween in another way. “Quebec” ~ “La Cucaracha”: Twilight Laboratory“Quebec” (2003) isThis work is at the intersection of introspection and psychedelia. Rather than laughter, loneliness and silence came to the fore. This was the moment when Ween faced the word “mature” for the first time. And “La Cucaracha” in 2007. The title is “Cockroach”. As the name suggests, it symbolizes the life force that will not die no matter how hard you get hit. This work condenses the irony and beauty of the very existence of Ween. Boognish never dies — reunion and cult continuationIn the 2010s, Ween quietly reunited. Gene and Dean’s smiles on stage were the same as they were back then. There were people in the audience who grew up listening to Ween in the 90s,There was a mix of young people who learned about “Push th” Little Daisies” on YouTube.  “Laughing is our religion. ”— Gene Ween, 2012 Interview Boognish will never die. As long as he laughs, the music will remain free. Ween is “endless laughter” that transcends genre barriers.

Dean and Gene meet as childhood friends, armed with cassette tapes and cheap equipment. He earnestly continued to play with sounds, something that no major artist could do. That path was both a parody of American culture and the purest love. A B-grade melody that was treated like garbage, a rural scene that no one paid attention to,Drunken laughter—they picked up all of that and turned it into a “myth. ” Ween created neither a genre nor a movement. It is an infinitely expanding belief that ““you can love any kind of music. ’’There is the decadence of rock, the intelligence of jazz, the future of techno,The warmth of the country is all equally equal. What Boognish symbolizes is not God, but the urge to laugh. That laughter can still be heard from behind speakers somewhere around the world. Even if the sound is distorted, the rhythm is distorted, and everything is broken…The spirit of Ween is still alive there.  “We just want to have fun. ”— Dean Ween And that is the eternal identity of Ween. Laugh, love, destroy, and build again. An endless voyage to return to the origins of music. Today, Ween is still laughing happily at the bottom of the ocean somewhere. "

    "body": "Prologue: From Silence to a Sea of ​​Electronics — Manchester Dawn      Text: mmr   Theme: From Joy Division to New Order - A story of the transformation and rebirth of sound, from darkness to light, from solitude to the dance floor.    In the late 1970s, the industrial city of Manchester was in the midst of devastation and stagnation. Rising unemployment, social unrest, and gray skies. Among them, Joy Division turned the despair of young people into sound with their inorganic beats and cold poetry. Ian Curtis’s voice resonated as a symbol of the pain and loneliness of the times, opening the door to a new era of post-punk. However, Curtis’ death in 1980 brought that story to an abrupt end. The remaining members choose rebirth from their sadness and step into the future of electronic music. The birth of New Order was the beginning of a new chapter in the Manchester sound that had evolved beyond tragedy. Chapter 1: Shadows of Manchester“Post-punk embryonic movement”At the end of the 1970s, Britain was in the midst of economic recession and industrial decline, and youth culture developed independently in urban areas. Manchester was no exception, and under the factory smoke and gray skies, music existed as a medium to express despair and hope at the same time. “Dawn of band formation”In 1976, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Stephen Morris met and formed Joy Division. The early members connected through school and the local punk scene, and at first they played cover songs, but eventually evolved into original songs that reflected their sense of isolation and the gloom of the city. “Thread of influence”Kraftrock from the likes of Kraftwerk and Neu!, the cold, hard sounds of the Velvet Underground, and the avant-garde elements of David Bowie and Roxy Music formed the foundation of Joy Division’s early sound. Chapter 2: Despair of Sound—The World of Joy Division“Internal Sound”Ian Curtis” lyrics depict self-alienation, social anxiety, and inner darkness. Songs such as ““Transmission” and ““She”s Lost Control” are masterpieces that overlap the loneliness of the individual with the inorganic nature of the city. “Production Innovation”Producer Martin Hannett used recording techniques to pursue a spatial sound that was different from traditional rock music. The reverb on the drums and the three-dimensional placement of the bass were important elements that created the coldness and tension of Joy Division’s sound. “The magic of live performance”Joy Division’s early live shows, with their dim lighting and Curtis’ unique dance moves, overwhelmed the audience. The stage performance, which became legendary among a limited audience, had a great influence on the later new wave/post-punk generation. Purchase on Amazon → Unknown Pleasures Chapter 3: Individuality and Destiny—Ian Curtis’ Conflict“Darkness in the depths of the heart”Curtis, who suffered from epilepsy and depression, spends his days torn between self-expression and his illness. While his symptoms affected his live performances, they also became a factor in deepening his musicality. “Love and Solitude”Balancing married life and band activities was extremely difficult. His relationship with his wife Debbie and his secret relationship with his mistress also overlap, amplifying the reality of the loneliness that pervades the lyrics. “The Last Night”On May 18, 1979, Ian Curtis died at his home in Manchester. The tragedy shocked the band members and fans, and cast a deep shadow on music history. Purchase on Amazon → Closer Chapter 4: Rebuilding the Legacy—Transforming into a New Order“Those left behind”After Curtis’ death, the remaining members did not disband the band and instead sought a new direction. With Bernard Sumner on vocals, a more electronic and danceable musicality emerges. “Fusion of synth and dance”In addition to guitar and bass, he actively introduced synthesizers and drum machines. This created a club sound and established New Order’s identity. “First Hit”In 1983, the 12-inch single “Blue Monday” was released and became a hit all over the world. It is a symbolic work that bridges club culture and commercial music. Purchase on Amazon → Power Corruption &amp; Lies Chapter 5: The heart of the Manchester scene“Factory Record Challenge”Founded by Tony Wilson, the label values ​​musical freedom and aesthetics. Pursuing the fusion of design and music, he and his band led the Manchester sound until the label collapsed. “Interaction between club culture and bands”Haçienda will be the setting for New Order”s DJ sets, and the band”s music will be inextricably linked to the dance floor. A two-way relationship with the local community was created. “Musical individuality created by regional characteristics”Manchester’s gray, industrial environment was fertile ground for a cold yet lyrical musical style. The relationship between cities and music had a great influence on later generations of artists. Purchase on Amazon → Movement Chapter 6: The Musical Evolution of New Order“Experiment by album”With songs such as “Power, Corruption &amp; Lies,” “Low-Life,” and “Technique,” they further deepened their fusion of rock, synth, and dance. They experimented with different production techniques on each album, increasing their reception in clubs and on the radio. “Fusion of video/design and sound”The artwork by Peter Saville connects music and visuals and establishes New Order”s brand identity. The design became an important element that symbolically expressed the album”s content. “Cooperation and friction between members”The division of roles and clashing opinions between Sumner, Hook, Morris, and Gillian Gilbert create tension within the band as the music evolves. Friction also became a driving force for creativity. Purchase on Amazon → Technique Chapter 7: From Tragedy to Hope—Story of Music and Humanity“Joy Division Influence”Joy Division’s influence can be seen in many genres, including post-punk, gothic, and electronica. In particular, the method of expressing loneliness and urban coldness through music was inherited by many subsequent bands. “The Universality of New Order”It became a hit all over the world in clubs and on the radio. Music came to be consumed as part of dance and daily life, blurring the line between pop and underground. “Never Ending Journey”Despite disbanding and reforming, Joy Division’s legacy lives on through New Order. Music and human stories become a mirror that reflects the shadows and hopes of a city. Purchase on Amazon → Still Chapter 8 (extra edition): Anecdotes, people, equipment, inside stories“Unreleased sound sources and rare tracks”The BBC sessions and demo recordings include many famous songs that were not later made into albums. Excavation by fans continues even now. “Live Improvisation and Accidents”Equipment troubles and improvised arrangements during live performances also strengthen the band’s expressive power. Their legendary live performance has become a topic of conversation among fans. “Changes in equipment and recording technology”From Martin Hannett’s production techniques to the introduction of synthesizers and drum machines, equipment choices were closely tied to changes in musicality. Purchase on Amazon → Retro Final chapter: Light born from the gray cityThe transition from Joy Division to New Order is not just a story of band changes. It is a microcosm of the history of music at the end of the 20th century: “rebuilding despair and turning it into light”. Ian Curtis’ poems of loneliness and destruction echo through the gray industrial areas of Manchester. Out of that afterglow came New Order’s flickering electronic beats. In other words, it was within Joy Division’s silence that the rhythm of New Order was sprouting. The city of Manchester was a place for young people to find expression in the midst of economic devastation. Music recorded the emotions of the times more honestly than politics or religion. What supported that sound was a strange fusion of temperature, where technology envelopes human pain. Martin Hannett”s reverberation, Peter Saville”s design, Haçienda’s lighting and architecture——All of these things came together to form a cultural area called the Manchester Sound. Joy Division’s sound is a mirror that looks into the night,The sounds of New Order were a beacon to dance through the night. Their trajectory is described as ““a beat of hope that can only be played by those who have overcome tragedy. ’’It still resonates in countless artists and club floors. Amidst the Spotify playlist and the spinning sound of analog discs,Joy Division and New Order still coexist. The moment when past and future, solitude and joy, analog and digital intersect,Even now, the city of Manchester continues to shine a pale light amidst the greyness.  “Love Will Tear Us Apart” — And the sounds connect again.

    "title": "[Column] A complete history of Krautrock - German experimental music as infinite movement",
    "body": "Introduction: Why “krautrock”?Text: mmr｜Theme: Krautrock is an important trend that deeply influenced later generations of music such as experimental music, electronic music, post-rock, and techno that originated in Germany. “Krautrock”——. It was originally a derogatory name given by a British music magazine. “Sauerkraut” is a slang term for German people. However, young people in the late 1960s reversed that label and used it as a banner for creating their own music. Postwar Germany. Memories of defeat, the flood of American and British culture, and the emptiness of not having a voice. Krautrock was born out of this “nothingness. ”It is not just a musical movement, but a reconstruction of the post-war generation’s identity. Eventually, it became a “philosophical movement of sound” that reinvented the history of rock. Chapter 1: Creation from nothing - Postwar Germany and the reconstruction of sound Student movements gripped Berlin and Paris, and culture was beginning to intertwine with politics. At the same time, Karlheinz Stockhausen’s electronic music was blaring on the Cologne radio station. His abstract, mathematical sound construction instilled in later young people a sense of ““designing sound from scratch. ’’CAN’s founders Holger Czukay and Irmin Schmidt were his students. Having received a classical education, they viewed rock as an extension of modern music, rather than as anti-art. Their experimental spirit connects with the commune culture that followed the student movement, and the studio transforms into a ““social experimental site. ’’  “We don’t have the blues. We just have to make our own sound. ”— Holger Czukay (CAN) This attitude of searching for the “sound of one’s own country” was the origin of krautrock. Chapter 2: CAN - The Philosophy of Rhythm and the Science of Improvisation“Inner Space Studio” is an old castle on the outskirts of Cologne. This is where the myth of CAN was born. Jaki Liebezeit’s metronome-like drums,Michael Caroli guitar,And Damo Suzuki, a vocalist who has wandered from Japan. In 1970, he happened to meet Damo Suzuki, a Japanese hippie singing on the streets of Cologne. That night, they were already on stage and the album ““Tago Mago’’ was born. “Would you like to take the stage?”—the impromptu night began instantly. He ended up becoming a member of the band. Their music is a “fluid rhythm” that rejects structure. Especially on the album “Tago Mago” (1971), the songs were rearranged through editing. This gave rise to the concept that “recording tape itself is an instrument. ”Shukai’s editing techniques were similar to later hip-hop sampling.  “Rhythm rules time. But improvisation frees you from time. ”— Jaki Liebezeit CAN’s sound is a “listening journey. ” An endless groove that swims between stillness and movement, chance and order. It would later influence Radiohead, The Fall, and even Aphex Twin. Chapter 3: NEU! - Minimalism and running towards the futureNEU! was formed after Kraftwerk’s early members Klaus Dinger and Michael Lotter left the group. The sound was “pure movement” with all unnecessary decorations removed. Dinger’s drum continues to tick at a constant speed, like a never-ending conveyor. This beat eventually became known as ““Motorik’’. Rotor’s guitar and bass slide like a streamline,Music has made “moving forward” itself an objective. NEU! recorded in the studio due to a lack of funds. Rotating the tape in reverse, changing the speed, cutting and pasting the sounds,It shook the boundary between “life” and “machine. ”  “Motorik is the sound of ““human continuation,’’ not a machine. ”— Klaus Dinger This simple rhythmic structure is similar to David Bowie’s Berlin trilogy. He also left a huge influence on Brian Eno’s ambient works. In NEU!’s sound, the listener realizes that time is not a straight line but a circle. Chapter 4: Faust - The Art of Collage and DestructionThis studio is a converted farmhouse in the countryside of Wünme. A group of people holed up there, mixing tapes, noise, radio snippets, samples, everything - that’s Faust. They created new music by completely destroying the “rock format. ” member Jan Ermler says. “We didn”t believe in rock. The only thing we believed in was “recorded tape. ’” The jacket of his 1971 debut album “Faust” was printed on transparent vinyl to resemble a pulsating heart. Music was also fragmented. The songs have no melody, and are more like listening to a radio program. However, it was a challenge to the very framework of pop music. They were strongly influenced by pop art and Dadaism. The punk, industrial, and sampling cultures that followed were all based on Faust’s genes.  “Destruction is the beginning of creation. ”— Jan Ermler (Faust) Chapter 5: Kraftwerk - The origins of techno and inorganic beautyDüsseldorf. The straight roads and cold texture of the industrial city became music. Kraftwerk by Ralf Hütter and Florian SchneiderIn the early days, it was improvisational rock that made full use of flute and organ. However, in 1974, with Autobahn, they suddenly began to “design” music. Electronic sounds, rhythm machines, and “humans as machines. ”Even on stage, they performed with no emotion and no expressions. This complete anonymity was heresy in the rock scene at the time. However, there was an attitude of searching for a ““new subject for Germans. ’’Denying the past (war) and finding salvation in the future (technology).  “We are machines made by human hands, and music is a reflection of that. ”— Florian Schneider Kraftwerk’s minimal and linear sound is a blend of Detroit techno, synth pop,It influenced all of hip-hop and house. The “future” that they saw is now in our current musical landscape. Chapter 6: Cluster - The boundary between silence and electronicsRevolution in silenceUnit Cluster by Dieter Möbius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius. Unlike CAN and Faust, they are hardly “noise” or “rock”. The reverberations and breathing of the city were felt between the inorganic electronic sounds and silence. His debut album, Cluster 71 (1971), is a series of experimental tape sounds, but also somehow meditative. The follow-up, ““Zuckerzeit”’ (1974), was produced by Neu!”s Klaus Dinger and introduced a minimalist and comfortable rhythm. Electronic sounds became the “sounds of everyday life” - one of the origins of what later became Ambient and Electronica.  “The nothingness between the sounds is the space in which we compose. ” - Hans-Joachim Roedelius Chapter 7: Harmonia - Cluster meets Neu!In 1973, Neu!’s guitarist Michael Rother joined the two members of Cluster, and Harmonia was born. The setting is Forst, a rural village in northern Germany. They set up a studio in a place where trains rarely come. Birth of “pastoral electronic music”Harmonia’s sound is between the silence of Cluster and the rhythm of Neu!. In ““Musik von Harmonia’’ (1974), gentle electronic undulations spread out like a green landscape. Their follow-up, ““Deluxe” (1975), was described by Brian Eno as ““the most important band in the world,” and he himself later visited Forst to record a co-written song.  “Their sound was the pastoral music of the future” - Brian Eno The sonic spirit born from Forst has been passed down to Ambient, Post-rock, and even contemporary environmental music. Chapter 8: Popol Vuh - Spirituality and Sound in ImagesPopol Vuh stands out among krautrock. Leader Florian Fricke was deeply devoted to religious music and philosophy, and was an early adopter of the Moog synth. However, what he was aiming for was not the coldness of electronics, but mystery and inner sound. Resonance with HerzogFilm director Werner Herzog fell in love with their spiritual sounds and used them in many of his films, including ““Aguirre,” ““Nosferatu,” and ““Fitzcarraldo. ’’The music of ““Aguirre”’ (1975) shook the audience”s consciousness like a hallucination echoing in the Andes mountains.  “The sound of Popol Vu was the words of prayer that the soul heard. ” It can be said that Krautrock’s ““spiritual experiment’’ reached its religious peak here. Chapter 9: Klaus Schulze - The Lone Traveler of the SynthesizerFormer Tangerine Dream drummer and electronic music seeker Klaus Schulz. He expanded on krautrock through solitary studio work rather than in a group setting. They constructed long tracks, each lasting over 30 minutes, and created it as if to ““sculpt’’ time with sound. His masterpieces “Timewind” (1975) and “Moondawn” (1976) are electronic meditations with endless rhythms and sequencers. For later Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis, and even Techno writers, he became the starting point for the ““philosopher of electrons’’.  “The synthesizer is my universe. Solitude is the fuel for creativity. ” - Klaus Schulze Chapter 10: Krautrock Genes - To the Next GenerationIn the late 1970s, young people in Germany were once again undergoing change. Krautrock’s experimental spirit manifests itself in punk and new wave. In Berlin, David Bowie and Brian Eno created the ““Berlin Trilogy”’ and absorbed Kraut”s aesthetic.  Bowie’s “Low” (1977) is a fusion of Neu! and Cluster.  Joy Division and The Fall reinjected motorik rhythms into rock.  In the 90s, Stereolab and Tortoise combined krautrock with pop. Krautrock is more than just a genre name. This is the very spirit of ““finding your own sound. ’’ Chronology of major krautrock bandsflowchart TDtitle[ Krautrock major band chronology ]A1968[ 1968 : Formation of CAN (Cologne) ]A1970[ 1970 : Formation of Kraftwerk (Dusseldorf) ]A1971a[ 1971 : Formation of Faust (Wuppertal) ]A1971b[ 1971 : Neu!

It is a story of a ““universal creative spirit” rather than a ““German origin. ”Tapes, rhythms, electronic waves–they still play in the underground studio.  “Krautrock isn”t over. It”s still going on in your ears. ” "

However, now it is a ““space that embraces sound’’ and is an extension of culture. Germany has imbued sound with precision engineering, Britain with tradition and formality, America with freedom and power, and Japan with delicate harmony. Car audio in each country is also a crystallization of that society’s aesthetic sense and industrial philosophy. Rolls-Royce’s “silent stage” is the ultimate in silence. Tesla’s DSP control connects electrical signals and emotions. And Mark Levinson of Lexus plays with materials and space as “instruments. ”These are not just speaker systems, but ““architectures of sound’’ where humans and machines, engineering, and sensibilities intersect. Now that the shift to EVs is progressing, the symbolic element of engine sound is disappearing,In-car acoustics are beginning to take on a new role. It is a “moving listening room” and a “personal acoustic universe. ”Manufacturers around the world are no longer pursuing horsepower or quietness;“What kind of sounds can you hear by running?” This is a new experience value. Car audio never stops evolving. The acoustic design is corrected by AI, and the seat becomes a resonating plate, changing the sound field according to the driver’s heartbeat and mood. What we will end up with is a realm of sonic equality that transcends countries and brands. The act of listening while running sharpens human sensibilities once again. What cars tell us is not the road, but the journey of sound. And that journey has only just begun. "

    "body": "Raja Ram × Simon Posford: Encounter and chemical reactionText: mmr｜Theme: Philosophy of the acoustic universe drawn by Raja Ram and Simon Posford Shpongle is a monumental psychedelic electronica/psychedelic project centered around Simon Posford and Raja Ram. Formed in 1996, inspired by the total solar eclipse in India, they have presented an “audio-journey” that fuses ethnic sampling, acoustic instrumentation, and masterful studio production. Their sound image is distinct from club-oriented trance, and invites listeners to a story that transcends time and space. Prologue: Sound is the door to enlightenmentShpongle is more than just an electronic music unit. It is the spiritual pinnacle of modern electronic music, embodying Sound Enlightenment. The members are psychedelic sage Raja Ram (formerly of Quintessence) and sound magician Simon Posford (Hallucinogen). The band was born in 1996 from a chance session at Twisted Records studios outside London. Their sound is a unique “mandala of sound” that combines consciousness, meditation, vision, philosophy, and technology.  “Shpongle is the experience of enlightenment through hearing. ”— Simon Posford Chapter 1: Birth of Shpongle and historical background of Twisted RecordsIn the 1990s, British psychedelic culture was at a crossroads in its evolution. A time when the Goa Trance craze swept Europe and LSD culture merged with technology. At the center of this trend was Twisted Records (1996-). Twisted releases spiritual and intellectual trance music centered on Posford, including Hallucinogen, Younger Brother, Prometheus, and Celtic Cross. Shpongle was born with the theme of “journey into the inner universe” at its core. flowchart TDA[ 1994: TIP RecordsRaja Ram &amp; Graham Wood ] --&gt; B[ 1996: Established Twisted RecordsCentered on Simon Posford ]B --&gt; C[ 1998: Shpongle formed ]C --&gt; D[ Younger Brother / Hallucinogen / Celtic CrossRelated project development ]D --&gt; E[ 2000s: UK psych culture revival ]E --&gt; F[ 2010s~: Fusion with world festival culture ]Twisted served as the ‘intellectual mecca’ of UK psychedelic culture.

Chapter 5: History of Thought and Hindu Philosophy of Raja RamFrom hippie culture to sonic yogaIn the late 1960s, Raja Ram led Quintessence, introducing Hindu philosophy to rock music.

Chapter 6: Simon Posford - The Sound Magician’s Production PhilosophyPosford combines classic synths (Virus, Nord Lead, Roland SH-101) with modern DAWs (Logic Pro, Ableton). Dozens of layers of sound are layered to intentionally design “resonance with brain waves. ”His works have a consistent three-layered structure: low range = body, overtones = consciousness, and reverberation = spirituality. Production workflow example   Sampling of natural and ethnic sounds     Microtonal processing (Detuning) on ​​synths     Phase inversion and reverse reverb     Synced to brainwave rhythm (Theta/Alpha)     Reconstruction in 3D space (Ambisonics)   “Rather than creating sounds, I feel like guiding the sounds that appear. ”— Simon Posford Chapter 7: Comparative analysis with Young Brother / Hallucinogen      Project   Direction   Spirituality   Sound Characteristics         Hallucinogen   External Hallucination   Chemical Trance   BPM Fast/Sharp       Younger Brother   Inner spiritual exploration   Emotions/Lyrics   Organic/Pop-oriented       Shpongle   Fusion of consciousness and space   Philosophy/Spirituality   Super-constructive/multilayered acoustics   Hallucinogen (Simon Posford) @ Ozora Festival 2015Younger Brother “Spinning Into Place”Chapter 8: Nāda Brahma and Sound Meditation PracticesWhat is Nāda Brahma? “The universe is sound, and sound is God. ” This ancient Indian philosophy is the basis of Shpongle. Sound is born, changes, disappears, and regenerates again. That is reincarnation itself. Shpongle-style acoustic meditation method   Breathe in the dark room     Play Divine Moments of Truth     Focus on the moment when the sound is “born”     The layers of sound expand and boundaries disappear.     Listen to your inner voice when you reach silence  Scientifically, alpha and theta waves become dominant, leading to a deep meditative state. The sound of Shpongle is like a temple bell in the brain. Chapter 9: Resonance with psychedelic visualsShpongle is completed not only by sound but also by resonance with visual art. He is especially famous for his collaborations with Android Jones (digital vision painter) and Alex Gray (spiritual painter).       Artist   Works/Relationship   Features         Android Jones   Shpongletron Visual   Visual Mandala Generation       Alex Grey   Sharing the theme of “sound = light = consciousness”   Fusion expression of the human body and the universe   SHPONGLEDROIDAlex Gray &amp; ShpongleChapter 10: Shpongle’s Psychoacoustics - Interaction of the Brain and ConsciousnessPosford constructs sound as a neurological ritual. The undulating bass resonates with heart rate variability, and the overtones of the flute stimulate the pineal gland in the brain. This structure causes a psychological phenomenon called an “acoustic trip. ”       Acoustic elements   Physiological effects   Psychological experiences         Low frequency base   Synchronization of breathing and heartbeat   Grounding feeling       High-frequency overtones   Pineal gland activity   Visual hallucinations/time dilation       Reverb reverberation   Expansion of spatial localization   Dissolution of ego       Polyrhythm   Cognitive delay   Dreamy floating feeling   Scientifically, Shpongle is a project to ““rebuild the brain with sound. ’’ Final Chapter: Enlightenment as Sound - Significance of Shpongle’s existencesays Raja Ram.  “I am a sound traveler. Instead of searching for God, I wake up in sound. ” Shpongle is a 21st century scripture born at the intersection of technology and spirituality. Electronic sounds become mantras, beats become meditation, and listening becomes prayer. Sound is born, changes, returns to silence, and is revived again. This endless cycle is the ““Saṃsāra of Sound,’’ and it is the very world that Shpongle depicts.  “Nothing Lasts… But Nothing Is Lost. ”    Everything disappears, but nothing is lost.  ConclusionShpongle is the 21st century embodiment of “enlightenment through sound. ”The sound transcends science, philosophy, religion, and technology. He is reconstructing human consciousness itself as sound. It’s not just music. It is the evolution of the act of “listening” itself,It is the mandala of consciousness left to humanity by Raja Ram and Simon Posford.  “Sound is born, disappears, and returns again. That’s what Shpongle is. ” "

    "body": "Quiet Revolutionary - Haruomi HosonoText: mmr｜Theme: From Happy End to YMO to Ambient—Tracing the “soundscapes” and cultural backgrounds drawn by Haruomi Hosono through the ages Haruomi Hosono is a musician who has continued to transform Japanese pop music for half a century. From the late 1960s to the present, his music has carved out a unique horizon by ““shifting the era” rather than ““defining the era. ”Diverse cultures, humor, nostalgia, technology—all of these are blended into Hosono’s sound. Prologue: April Fool’s Day - Prehistoric Activities (1969)Masterpiece: “April Fool” (1970, solo project)A fusion of folk, psychedelic, and Beatles-style pop, expressing an urban sensibility with lyrics in Japanese and English. This work is mainly composed, arranged, and performed by Hosono, and serves as a bridge to Happy End. Historical backgroundBefore the formation of Happy End, 1969–1970. A period of exploration of urban pop. Production environmentAnalog recording at home or in a small studio. Uses organ, guitar, and simple microphone. AnecdoteA friend added sound effects and laughter to the tape recordings, and his sense of humor quickly developed. Chapter 1: Happy End - Dawn of Japanese Rock (1969–1972)Representative work: “Kazamachi Roman” (1971)A monumental work that depicts the poetic atmosphere of the city of Tokyo in the context of rock for the first time. During this period, Hosono played an important role in composing music while also playing bass. Songs such as ““It’s Summer” and ““Gather the Wind” have an urban yet nostalgic sound. Historical backgroundIn the midst of high economic growth after the war. With the rise of folk and GS, the search for a new expression called “Japanese rock” began. Happy End was the first band to explore ““Japanese rhythms that were not imitations of English. ’’ Production environmentRecordings at that time were made at Yotsuya Onkyo House’s predecessor studio. Warm sound from analog tape recording and vintage equipment. Although influenced by American bands such as The Band and Buffalo Springfield, they put literary Japanese lyrics to the fore. AnecdoteHosono, who was frustrated by the number of equipment problems during recording, reportedly said, ““I want a place where I can record the sound a little better. ’’After that, it became the foundation for him to pursue his own sonic ideals. Chapter 2: Caramel Mama - Dawn of Japanese Rock (1973)Masterpiece “Caramel Mama” (1975)They fuse elements of folk, psychedelic rock, and show a musicality that is directly connected to the later Happy End. Hosono participated on bass and keyboard, demonstrating his improvisational and arranging skills. Historical backgroundIt was a transitional period when folk and psychedelic music began to attract attention in Japan, and an urban rock culture was formed. Production environmentHome recording at a studio on campus or at a friend’s house. I tried to fuse acoustic and electric. AnecdoteThere was a free atmosphere during the live performance, with audience members getting on stage and participating in improvisational performances. This experience led to his later work on the Tropical Trilogy and YMO’s sense of humor. Chapter 3: Tin Pan Alley - Dawn of Japanese Rock (1974)Masterpiece “Tin Pan Alley” (1977)Blues, R&amp;B, and Beatles-style pop are digested in Japanese, with a focus on music played at school festivals and live music venues in Tokyo. Hosono was in charge of bass and composition, demonstrating an early urban sensibility. Historical backgroundThe nascent period of urban pop-rock in Japan, influenced by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Production environmentRecording at on-campus studios and small live music venues. He also made simple recordings at home, which became the forerunner of the later home recording culture. AnecdoteThere was a lot of trial and error in creating songs among the members, and there was also a lot of experimentation with improvisation and rhythm changes. Chapter 4: Tropical Trilogy - Exploring Exoticism (1973–1978)Representative works: “Tropical Dandy” (1975) “Taian Yoko” (1976) “Haraiso” (1978)Asia, South Seas, Latin, Hawaii, and Japan. During this period, Hosono did not try to imitate ““foreign countries,’’ but rather expressed the exoticism that Japanese people dreamed of. It is characterized by a structure that resembles a fictional travelogue and a witty arrangement. Historical backgroundJapan after the oil shock. My yearning for overseas travel and exotic cultures grows. In television and movies, the idea that ““tropical countries = healing” spread, and in music, ““imaginary resorts” became a theme. Production environmentRecorded at home/studio “HOSONO HOUSE” (Saitama, Sayama). They converted the living room of a wooden house into a studio and recorded using analog tape and a simple mixer. This home recording style became the origin of later city pop and home recording culture. AnecdoteDuring the recording of “HOSONO HOUSE”, the power breaker tripped many times. Hosono is said to have laughed and continued recording, saying, ““The sound of electricity falling is part of the music. ’’This relaxed atmosphere is reflected in the warm, organic sound. Chapter 5: Technopop Revolution - YMO and the Future of Electronics (1978–1983)Representative works: Yellow Magic Orchestra”Solid State Survivor”(1979) “BGM” (1981) “Technodelic” (1981)YMO (Yellow Magic Orchestra) is a revolutionary unit that spread the word techno pop around the world. As a leader, Hosono used rhythm machines and sequencers to fuse Asian humor and futuristic sounds. Historical backgroundIn the early 1980s, Japan reached the peak of its technological and economic prosperity. A time when the development of computers, video games, and electronic musical instruments were fused with music. YMO’s sound was a symbol of Japan as an electronic nation. Production environmentRecording bases are “Alpha Studio” and “Shibaura Studio”. He used state-of-the-art equipment at the time, including the Roland MC-8, Prophet-5, and Fairlight CMI. A workflow that was ahead of its time, in which each member’s home studio is networked for production. AnecdoteDuring YMO’s early live performances, the songs often stopped midway due to computer malfunctions. The audience laughed, and so did the members. Hosono is said to have said, ““Machines are just like humans, and it’s interesting that they make mistakes. ’’ Chapter 6: Pop in Silence - Ambient and Solo Work (1984–1990)Representative works: “Philharmony” (1982) “Omni Sight Seeing” (1989)“Philharmony” is a masterpiece recorded at home, making full use of sampling and synthesizers. On the other hand, ““Omni Sight Seeing” combines elements of ethnic music and environmental sounds, depicting the culmination of a ““sonic journey”. Historical backgroundJapan during the bubble economy. In the midst of a culture of excessive consumption, Hosono’s music, on the contrary, is oriented toward ““silence” and ““space. ”Around the world, Brian Eno, Jon Hassell, and others were advocating ambient music, and Hosono was in line with that trend. Production environmentHome studio in Nishiazabu, Tokyo. Focusing on digital equipment from Roland and Yamaha,An experimental process that interweaves “tape fragments” and “environmental sounds. ”The living room was used as a recording booth, and even the echoes from the furniture became part of the sound. AnecdoteIt is said that in the recording of ““Philharmony,” he used the sound of a cat’s cry, which he happened to hear, as the ““sound material. ”Hosono jokingly said, ““Music is about living with chance. ’’ Chapter 7: Landscape Music - Soundtracks and Ambient Sounds (1990–2000)Representative works: “Night on the Galactic Railway” (1985) “Minima Moralia” (1986) “N. D. E. ” (1995)It was a time when he worked on music for a wide variety of media, including animation, movies, and commercials. ““Night on the Galaxy Express”’ shines with delicate compositions that seem to translate Kenji Miyazawa”s fantasy literature into sound. Historical backgroundAfter the bursting of the bubble economy, Japan’s values ​​have been shaken. The keywords “healing,” “environment,” and “nostalgia” began to appear at the center of culture. Hosono’s music is quiet and full of deep reverberations, as if anticipating that atmosphere. Production environmentHe simplified the equipment he built during his time at YMO and created a minimalist production environment at home. Experimented with DAT recording and early digital mixing. I’m more of a “sound artist” than a musician. AnecdoteDuring the production of ““Night on the Galaxy Express’’, environmental sounds were recorded next to the railroad tracks at night in order to reproduce the acoustics. That sound remains faintly in the final track. Chapter 8: Country and Folk Songs - Sounds of Land and Memory (2000–2015)Representative works: “HoSoNoVa” (2011) “Heavenly Music” (2013)Reconstructing postwar Japanese radio culture and early Showa era swing. They delivered the sound of a “nostalgic future” to the ears of the digital generation. Historical backgroundAfter the earthquake and economic stagnation, Japanese society began to seek a “local” and “return to the spirit. ”Hosono embodies this trend through his sounds, saying, ““Nostalgia illuminates the future. ’’ Production environment“Daisyworld Studio” is a private studio in Nakameguro. Uses vintage microphone, tape echo, and upright piano. During the recording, he turned off the air conditioner and focused on “breathing the sound. ” AnecdoteWhen the engineer stopped mixing during the recording of “HoSoNoVa”,Hosono reportedly said, ““I like how the sound is resting. ’’ You can get a glimpse of his unusual attention to the “space” of sound. Chapter 9: “Hosono-ism” in the digital age – From Quiet Logic to the present day (2015–)Representative works: “Quiet Logic” (2024) “Vu Jà Dé” (2018)In the age of AI and streaming, Hosono once again raises the theme of “tranquility. ”His works, which dissolve the boundaries between electronic and natural sounds, have a strong influence on younger generations of artists. Historical backgroundLoneliness and the acceleration of digitalization since the pandemic. Hosono’s sound is being reevaluated as an act that restores ““listening,” ““tranquility,” and ““humanity. ’’ Production environmentAlmost the entire film was recorded at home. Flexibly use DAW and hardware equipment,A modern workflow that allows data sharing with overseas musicians via online. AnecdoteWhen recording, he often records without adding a “click” sound. ““Fluctuations in tempo are proof that humans are breathing,’’ he is quoted as saying. Final Chapter: Humor and loneliness in the margins of soundHaruomi Hosono’s music is always full of “pause” and “lightness. ”It”s a sense of distance, as if you”re at the center of culture, yet looking at it from somewhere far away. In an era where the form of music continues to change, he still believes in the “stillness of sound. ” References/Links Haruomi Hosono Official Site YMO Official Book: “HOSONO 100 Views” Interview collection: [“Haruomi Hosono and his era” (Bungei Shunju)] (https://amzn. to/4pUbLbv) Video: [“NO SMOKING” (2019, directed by Taketoshi Sado)] (https://amzn. to/4gShjPA)"

    "body": "Giant of African Music - Who is Fela Kuti?Text: mmr｜Theme: The life and music of Fela Kuti Fela Aníkúlápó Kútì (1938–1997) was a Nigerian musician, activist, and founder of Afrobeat. Their unique sound, which blends jazz, funk, highlife, and Yoruba music, had an immense influence on world music in the second half of the 20th century. His music was not just entertainment, but a political statement denouncing military rule and injustice, and a symbol of resistance despite numerous arrests and violence. Life and musical evolutionFela Aníkúlápó Kútì was born in Abeokuta in 1938 and received his musical education in London before returning to Nigeria in the late 1960s and creating his own musical language, combining blues/jazz/funk/highlife with traditional rhythms. It became more political during the Koola Lobitos period in the 1960s and Africa ‘70 in the 1970s, and later developed into formations such as Egypt 80. Fela’s music is characterized by long (10 to 30 minute) repetitive grooves, strong horn sections, polyrhythms, and direct messages in pidgin English. Drummer Tony Allen was an integral part of the formation of Afrobeats, and his drumming laid the foundation for the genre. Political and cultural activitiesFela declared his mansion the ““Kalakuta Republic”’ and operated it as a community, studio, and theatrical space. There have been repeated harsh criticisms of the military government, and there are many incidents of attacks, detentions, and torture by the police and military (one famous incident is the “Expensive Shit” anecdote).

Artists from all over the world gather to celebrate Fela. International influences: Antibalas in America, sampling in hip-hop, even Beyoncé and Jay-Z have cited the rhythm of Fela. summaryFela Kuti was not only the “father of Afrobeats” but also a symbol of political resistance through music. That legacy continues to be reflected through his sons Femi Kuti and Soon Kuti, and in the work of artists around the world. If you want to learn more about Afrobeat, we recommend starting with ““Gentleman,” ““Expensive Shit,” and ““Zombie. ’’ The words and rhythms of Fela still echo in the breezes of Lagos and on the stages of the world.

Text: mmr   Theme: Carefully traces the history, representative works, related artists, anecdotes, and influence of Enoch Wright, who elevated the “demonstration record” of the stereo era to the level of art, and the company he founded, Command Records, to this day.    In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a person among audio enthusiasts who changed their orientation from ““records to be listened to” to ““records to be listened to. ” Conductor/producer Enoch Light started Command Records, a label pursuing high quality sound, in 1959, and became a symbol of ““hi-fi culture”’ with his unique artwork and cutting-edge recording technology. This article summarizes the entire story, including its historical context, representative works, relationship with Tony Mottola, and today”s evaluation. “Hi-Fi Lounge/Space Age Pop”Command Records clearly aimed at the market as an ““audio demonstration record,” selecting, arranging, and recording the songs with the highest priority on sound quality. Wright introduced the latest technology such as multi-mic recording and master recording on 35mm film, and practiced production with a strong awareness of the sound field (stereo image). This resulted in a group of albums that emphasized the ““panning effect” and localization of percussion instruments, and established the ““hi-fi lounge/space age pop’’ genre, which was different from general pop and jazz. Anecdote/Legend/Episode Gatefold and Graphic AestheticsCommand’s LP covers were visually strong, sometimes featuring a cover by abstract painter Josef Albers. The design of the CD as something that went beyond a mere demo disc to something people would want to own stimulated the collector culture that followed.  Promotional slogan: “You”ll be surprised the moment you hear it for the first time”Stereo 35/MM”s liner notes and promotions used provocative phrases such as ““You”ll be surprised when you hear it for the first time,’’ to arouse listeners’ interest. This is an example of successful marketing based on technical confidence.  The conflict between commerce and artThe sound quality, which was close to that of a ““demonstration’’ version, was welcomed by audiophiles, but some questioned its universality as a pop song. Despite this, there were some successes on Chart (Stereo 35/MM, etc. ), and Wright was one of the few producers who could make “technical appeal” commercially viable.

He also released albums by performers/arrangers such as Terry Snyder, Tony Mottola, and Dick Hyman on Command, showing his versatility as a producer. As a recording engineer, he collaborated with Bob Fine and others, conducting a number of acoustic experiments. Relationship between Tony Mottola and Enoch LightTony Mottola and Enoch Light are a core relationship at Command Records. In the hi-fi/stereo recording culture of the 1950s and 1960s, Enoch Light was called the “architect of sound. ” His right-hand man, who has always supported him with his performances and solo work, is jazz/studio guitarist Tony Mottola. Their relationship at Command Records was more than just producer and player. flowchart TDA[ Enoch LightConductor/Producer ] --&gt; B[ Command Records1959-1970s ]B --&gt; C[ Persuasive Percussion(Terry Snyder &amp; All Stars) ]B --&gt; D[ Provocative Percussion(Light Brigade) ]B --&gt; E[ Tony Mottola Solo WorksRoman Guitar Series ]E --&gt; F[ Roman Guitar Vol. 1 (1960) ]E --&gt; G[ Roman Guitar Vol. 2 (1961) ]E --&gt; H[ Roman Guitar Vol. 3 (1963) ]Who is Tony Mottola?American jazz/studio guitarist (1918–2004) He was active in sessions for the NBC Orchestra and television programs, and was one of New York’s busiest guitarists from the 1950s to the 1970s. He performs in a wide range of genres, including not only jazz, but also easy listening, Latin, pop, and film music. Encounter and relationship with Enoch Light Grand Award → Regular guitarist during Command RecordsWhen Enoch Light founded Grand Award and Command, he assembled New York’s top session talent. Among them, the regular guitar player is Tony Mottola. He also played an important role in the “Persuasive Percussion” and “Provocative Percussion” series. In experiments with Latin rhythms and stereo positioning, the guitar was useful as an instrument that could be easily assigned to left and right, and Mottola’s flexible playing was put to good use.  Solo album release (from Command)Command Records also releases many of Mottola’s solo works. The “Roman Guitar” (1960) series is particularly famous, and is a popular work that arranges Latin and Italian folk songs in high-fidelity. Since then, most of his masterpieces such as “Roman Guitar Vol. 2” and “Roman Guitar Vol. 3” have been produced under Enoch Light. Mottola was one of the pillars that supported Command’s “lounge/easy listening route. ” Trust in arrangement and recording style Command Records regular guitaristHe almost always participates in the recordings of the Grand Award~Command established by Light.

Persuasive/Provocative songs and jackets continue to be cited in the context of “mid-century design” and bachelor pad culture, and are also the subject of sampling and remixing. Its influence on modern listening culture (vintage audio hobbies, virtual room simulations, etc. ) is considerable. Summary: Legacy of Enoch LightEnoch Light was a man who not only pursued “good sound” but also designed an object called a record, redefining the “listening experience” in the stereo era. Command Records” works are still being reevaluated today in the context of audio history, design history, and pop culture. Creating the ““surprise’’ you feel when you listen to music for the first time is Wright”s true essence, and his works still retain that magical power. Also, the relationship between Enoch Light and Tony Mottola went beyond just “producer and guitarist”. Combining Light”s recording aesthetic with Mottola”s flexible and versatile guitar playing, Command Records became a space-age pop icon that continues to captivate audiophiles around the world. "

    "body": "What is Yahowha 13? - The musical legacy of Father Yod and the Source FamilyText: mmr｜Theme: About an unusual project that fuses music, religion, and communal practices that go beyond cult bands Yahowha13 (also known as Ya Ho Wha 13, Yahowah 13, YaHoWa13, etc. ) is a psychedelic rock/experimental music project with a strong improvisational and ritualistic feel, connected to the American spiritual commune “Source Family” that was active around the 1970s. The central character is Father Yod (real name: James Edward Baker). Although he himself was a leader in a religious movement, he was also deeply involved in music and sought to expand his teachings through his musical activities. Father Yod/James Edward Baker — Trajectory and LegendEarly life and careerBorn July 4, 1922 in Cincinnati, Ohio. He later talks about his experience serving as a Marine (although some point out that his Silver Star medal cannot be found in official records). Moving to the West Coast, he became devoted to the natural life movement, vegetarianism, hippie culture, and mystical thinking. He opened a health food restaurant called ““The Source’’ on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, which reportedly attracted many famous customers. Eventually, influenced by Yogi Bhajan’s Kundalini Yoga philosophy, he organized his own religious movement, Source Family. The group led by him developed a lifestyle that integrated communal living, spiritual practices, music, food and health practices, and rituals. Marriage, Wives, and Children: His legal wife was Robin Popper (later Ahom), but according to his followers, he had multiple wives (reportedly 14) and lived together with his followers. Anecdote/LegendJournalism and non-fiction articles have explored this dual nature, with anecdotes about him being a “soldier/former marine/war hero” and stories about him being a “cult leader/ex-marine/bank robber” with accusations of involvement in bank robberies and murders. While the commune was in operation, there are records that there were disputes that are typical of cult operations, such as ““abandonment of personal property,” ““cutting off of relatives,” and ““permission to marry young members. ’’ On August 25, 1975, he died in an accident while attempting his first hang glider flight in Hawaii (he is said to have crashed and died approximately 9 hours later). This accident effectively became an event that symbolized the “end” of Yahooha13. After that, the members of the congregation dispersed, but it has been reevaluated through sound archives and folklore. In particular, the 13-disc box set God and Hair (Yahowha Collection), released by Japan”s Captain Trip label in 1998, comprehensively covered Yahowha13/Source Family”s sound sources and became an opportunity for the revival of the legend. Musical development and composition of Yahowha13Constituent members and naming historyCore lineup: Mainly Djin Aquarian (guitar), Octavius ​​Aquarian (drums), and Sunflower Aquarian (bass), along with other “Aquarian surname” believer musicians such as Lovely, Hom, Rhythm, Pythias, Aquarian. Initially released under the name “Father Yod &amp; The Spirit of “76”. After that, spellings such as “Ya Ho Wa 13 / Yahowha13 / YaHoWha13 / Yahowa 13” were used with some fluctuation. There was also a period when they were active in bands under different names such as “Savage Sons of Ya Ho Wa,” “Fire, Water, Air,” and “Yodship. ” Interpretation by members and testimonies Djin Aquarian (Sunflower): “Our performance was not a song, but a prayer. ” Octavius: “Father Yod’s perspective and breathing determined the direction of the improvisation. ” Reminiscences of Source Family: Recording was a daily ritual, and music was a communion with God. In this way, Yahowha 13’s lyrics and performances focused on ““waves” and ““mantra” rather than ““meaning. ’’ Musical characteristics/improvisationCompletely improvised performance: Many of the recordings were made with a policy of no rehearsal, no overdubs, one-shot recording, and no cutting and pasting. Heavy use of tribal drums, bells, cans, chants, white noise, noisy guitars, etc. The composition is more like “ceremonial acoustics” than a song. Although some songs sometimes have a melodic/singing structure, the overall focus is on sonic experimentation with an emphasis on spatiality, repetition, and ritual. Lyrics and vocals (Father Yod’s chants, line-style recitations, and congregational choruses) are often closely connected to doctrine, chants, and meditative texts. Historical Phase (by year)Yahooha13’s music activities can be roughly divided into the following stages:  1973–1974: Spirit of “76 nominal periodKohoutek (1973), Contraction (1974), Expansion (1974), All or Nothing at All (1974), etc. The earliest experimental music period. During this period, he was exploring the fusion of acoustic experiments and chant sessions. Many recordings feature Father Yod himself contributing cans, chants, and percussion.  Mid-1974 to 1975: YaHoWa13 name period/technical deepening periodYa Ho Wa 13 (1974), Savage Sons of Ya Ho Wa (1974), Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony (1974), I”m Gonna Take You Home (1974), To the Principles for the Children (1975), The Operetta (unreleased in 1975 → released later), etc. During this period, attempts were also made to incorporate more “structurality” and “musicality,” with a style that included a mixture of distorted guitar riffs, repetitive phrases, and fragmented poetry and singing. In particular, Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony is said to be the most popular and re-evaluated work in the band’s history, and has been reissued many times.  After 1975: Father Yod postmortem/intermittent active phaseAfter 1975, the band disbanded due to Father Yod’s passing. However, lay musicians continued to record and perform. In 1977, Golden Sunrise (under the name Fire Water Air) and Yodship Suite (Private Press) were released. There is also a collaboration with Sky Saxon (former of The Seeds) and vocal participation. Since the 2000s, there have been reissues and archive reprints, fragmentary new recordings, and member reunions (such as Sonic Portation by Djin, Sunflower, Octavius, etc. ).

In particular, 1998’s God and Hair (a 13-disc collection) was an important milestone. Since the 2000s, remastered reissues of original LPs and unreleased material collections have been released one after another by Swordfish Records, Drag City, Captain Trip Records, and others. In 2012, the documentary film The Source Family (directed by Jodi Wille &amp; Maria Demopoulos) was released, and this sparked renewed interest among the general public. In 2009, a compilation of unreleased songs such as Magnificence in the Memory was released, which reignited the interest of fans and researchers. Reunion/ActivitiesIn 2007, the original members (Sunflower, Octavius, Djin) reportedly performed live for the first time in 33 years. In 2008, they released Sonic Portation and made a piecemeal comeback. Even after the 2010s, records remain of excavating archived sound sources, releasing recordings, and performing live (appearing at festivals such as SXSW). Heritage and SignificanceYahowha13 is attracting attention for its positioning as a ““religious improvisational acoustic work” that goes beyond the framework of rock and psychedelic music, as ““music = channeling and practice that is an extension of doctrine and ritual. ” It is argued that his orientation toward improvisation, spatiality, and transcendence left a considerable influence on later experimental music, improvisation, and sound art. In fields such as commune culture, cult movements, and outsider music research, the existence of Yahowha13/Source Family has become a typical example and subject of research. On the other hand, it also includes controversial topics such as ethical and historical criticism regarding the merits and demerits of believers and musicians, the fragmentation of records, and anecdotes and legends whose authenticity is unknown. Album details (by selected/notable works)*The LPs are concentrated between 1973 and 1975, and were initially recorded and sold under the name Father Yod &amp; The Spirit of ‘76, and later under the name Ya Ho Wa / Ya Ho Wha 13. Disc information varies greatly from edition to edition because it is a small press/archive. Kohoutek (1973/Father Yod &amp; The Spirit of ‘76) Point: The earliest collection of improvised experiments. You can hear the “premonition of a ritual” where roughness and energy coexist. It is popular with collectors as an early record with strong chants of Father Yod. Contraction (1974) / Expansion (1974) Point: A series of “cosmic” series. Acoustic experimentation (percussion, gongs, long call and response) is noticeable. A must-have if you are interested in early “experiments with voice and sound. ” Ya Ho Wa 13 (1974) Point: The core of self-recording. While recording at Garage, the band began to form an improvisational structure. Djin (guitar) / Sunflower (bass) / Octavius ​​(drums) and others are required. Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony (1974) Songs and highlights: Contains long tracks such as “Yod He Vau He,” “Ho,” “Journey Thru An Elemental Kingdom,” and “Ya Ho Wha. ” It is the crystallization of “ritualistic” and “psychedelic jam”, and is the most easily available representative album with many reissues. It has a large soundscape-like dynamic, and we recommend starting here for first-time listeners. I’m Gonna Take You Home (1974) Points: There are some songs that have a somewhat structured structure, and you can feel rough but melodic fragments. A work that features strong singing and chanting. Savage Sons of Ya Ho Wa / To the Principles for the Children / The Operetta (1974–1975) Point: Experiment and “prayer (doctrinal) nature” are mixed. The Operetta was recorded in 1975, but remained unreleased for a long time and was released later. Another feature of this project is that there are many unpublished/fragmented materials. Re-edit/Compilation: Magnificence in the Memory (2009, Drag City) Points: A compilation compiled from unreleased tapes. It has strong aspects of sound source preservation and remastering, and is well-organized for beginners. It received attention in reviews such as Pitchfork. Lyrics (poetic expression) analysis — typical themes and readingsFact: Many tracks are centered around chants, fragmented lines, and religious declarations (Father Yod’s “voice”), and official transcriptions of the lyrics are rare. It is rare for a song to have the full lyrics text in circulation, and the sound source itself is positioned as a ““document recording a ceremonial place’’ (the sound source and track name are available on Spotify / Shazam, etc. ). Main motif: Repetition of “Ya Ho Wha / Ya Ho Wa / YHWH (consonantal similarity)” - divine name/sacred role. References to the archetypal “travel/purification/elements (fire/water/air/earth)” — a symbol that also appears in the album/song titles. Doctrinal/ritual phrases (words indicated by redacted track names such as “man the messiah”)—words that are improvised and layered as a leader’s declaration. How to analyze: Rather than simply reading the lyrics as ““lyrics = transmission of meaning,” it is most useful to read them as follows: ““(1) The sound itself is a ritual / (2) Words are suggestive and poetic triggers that generate a communal experience on the spot. ” In other words, participatory religious guidance through “sound/repetition” is the core of the album. Mini biographies by members*Source Family believers have the same last name as “Aquarian”. Below is a short summary highlighting the activities and key involvements.  Father Yod (James Edward Baker)A religious leader and the “face” of the band. He runs the health food restaurant The Source, leads a commune, and participates in vocals, chants, and kettle drums in recordings. It is believed that he died in a hang gliding accident in Hawaii in 1975 (August 25, 1975).  Djin Aquarian (guitar)The main member who played the band’s “improvisational guitar”. In later years, he continued to work solo/reunited. He is often talked about as a central figure at the time in interviews and archives.  Sunflower (Patrick Sunflower Aquarian, base)He supports the band”s bass and is his father Yod”s right-hand man within the commune (distributive role). The history of their activities is summarized in recent interviews and radio.  Octavius ​​Aquarian (drum)In charge of tribal rhythm patterns and long grooves. Participated in later reunions with Djin and Sunflower.  Isis Aquarian / Electricity AquarianArchive/editor/recorder of Source Family. His book The Source: The Untold Story… (Isis &amp; Electricity) preserves and publishes primary materials, photographs, and unreleased music, and he also collaborated on the production of a 2012 documentary. Their materials supported modern reassessment.  Sky Saxon (from The Seeds)He is known for being part of Source Family for a time and being involved in Ya Ho Wha’s recording/reissue projects (including the 1998 Japan box set). Reissues in each country (overview)   Japan: 1998 luxury 13CD box God And Hair (Yahowha Collection) (Captain Trip Records) - A large collection of limited production, which has since been mainly distributed in the collector market. The Japanese version is known for its luxurious binding that stimulates collectors’ hearts.     UK/EU: Swordfish Records (UK) reissues some titles such as Penetration in remastered/limited press formats. An important label that supported reissue distribution in the UK.     America: Drag City (2009’s Magnificence in the Memory, etc. ) has released an archive compilation and is in charge of re-evaluation and distribution in the US. The editing of Drag City functioned as a sound source organization and an “entrance” to modern listeners.     Notes (Distribution):  Many first edition LPs are small pressings of 500-1000 copies. Original editions are expensive and rare. Reissues vary in the degree of editing of the sound source depending on the publisher and time (there is a mix of edited editions that include unreleased songs, re-presses with the originals, remastered editions, etc. ). We recommend checking the edition (year/label) when purchasing. Highlights &amp; recommended listening order (beginner → intermediate → researchers)Representative song/representative board (introductory): First go through Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony once. Understanding songwriting and chanting (intermediate): Listen to I’m Gonna Take You Home, Savage Sons of Ya Ho Wa and understand the difference between song elements and session elements. Archived/Unpublished (Research): Dig deeper with Drag City”s Magnificence in the Memory, Captain Trip”s God and Hair (13CD). High archival value. Primary sources for referenceSource Family Documentary (The Source Family, 2012) — Must-see video material. Lyrics and InterpretationLyrics and Interpretation of “Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony” (1974)Characteristics: Over a long improvisational performance, Father Yod repeatedly calls out ““love,” ““the universe,” and ““truth’’ like a prayer. Theme: A metaphor for sublimating sexual energy into “union with the universe. ” The title “Penetration” refers not only to the physical meaning but also to “penetrating into the depths of consciousness. ” Recurring Motifs: “God”, “Love”, “Children”, “Cosmic Light”, etc. Tracks under the name “Ya Ho Wha 13”The focus is on “spell-like vocalizations” rather than lyrics. The words sound more like a shout or a chant than clearly sung. The sound “Ya Ho Wha” itself is a sacred mantra of the Source Family, an expression of the “name of God” that the Yods used on a daily basis. “Man the Messiah”Contents: Urges Man to awaken as a “messian being”. Vocal Expression: The preaching tone and calls like “Wake up” and “The time is now” are impressive. Interpretation: Goes beyond the Christian image of a ““savior” and embodies the New Age idea that ““anyone can become the Messiah. ” Yahooha 13 Differences in reissues and ratings in different countries🇺🇸 AmericaInitial situation: In the 1970s, there were only self-produced discs (very small lots), and it remained a cult. 1990s: Reissues by indie labels such as Drag City and Swordfish in the context of a psychedelic reappraisal. After 2000s: With the release of The Source Family documentary film (2012), recognition has expanded as part of hippie cultural history. Evaluation trends: From the point of view of curiosity as ““the music of a strange cult group,” it is now considered an ““important record of the history of the American underground. ” 🇩🇪 GermanyRe-evaluated in a krautrock context: Amon Düül II and Can’s fan base discovers Yahowha 13 as an “acid jam. ” Extensive reissues: Since 1998, numerous reissues have been made through Captain Trip (actually a Japanese label) and German distributors. Evaluation trends: It was considered ““close to European avant-garde and improvisational music,’’ and emphasis was placed on musical purity. → It is often seen as an “acoustic experiment” rather than a religious theme. 🇯🇵 Japan90s psych reissue boom: P. S. F. Records and Captain Trip Records actively introduced Yahooha 13. It has been featured as a ““phantom cult psychedelic” in magazines such as ““Eureka” and ““Eurorock Press,’’ and Japanese listeners avidly collect it. Evaluation trends: In Japan, it is loved as ““heretical” and ““esoteric psychedelic,” and has become a collector’s item at imported disc shops (Disc Union, Melon, Manhattan Records, etc. ). They are also said to have influenced Japanese acid bands such as Acid Mothers Temple and High Rise. Comparison summary      Country   Main reissue period   Characteristic evaluation   Trend         🇺🇸 America   1990s ~ Drag City, etc.    From cult curiosity to historical reappraisal   “Legacy of commune music”       🇩🇪 Germany   Late 1990s ~   Discovered in the context of krautrock   “Acoustic Experiment” “Acid Jam”       🇯🇵 Japan   Early 1990s ~   Cult reissue for collectors   “Esoteric Psych” “Herotic Music”   Yahowha 13 and Source Family ─ Supplemental Interpretation Based on TestimonyImprovisation and the sense of unity of a “family community”Former member Sunflower (Djin Aquarian) said in an interview, ““Our performances were not songs, but prayers, and the energy of the community was expressed in sound. ’’ Yahowha 13’s sessions were held without prior rehearsal, with members receiving the “Yodo energy” and improvising sounds. For this reason, it can be said that the lyrics are not ““constructed poems,’’ but rather a style that repeats fragments of divine names and spiritual phrases. Role of Father YodAccording to family accounts, Yod (James Edward Baker) was originally a restaurateur turned spiritual leader of the Source Family. It is said that he was aware of his role in music as a ““conduit of energy” rather than a ““performer. ” Member Octavius ​​testifies, ““He let us play, but at the same time he was ‘listening’ to us. His gaze and his breathing determined the direction of the session. ’’ Communal life and musicThe Source Family lived together in a Hollywood mansion called The Father House, where they practiced daily meditation, vegetarianism, yoga, and group activities. Making music was an “extension of everyday life,” and his living room and basement became his studio. One family member recalled, ““Recording is a sacred ritual, and as long as you have a microphone and a tape recorder, the energy of the universe will naturally flow into you. ’’ Interpretation of lyrics and mantra natureThe words “Ya Ho Wha” are not just a band name, but the “name of God” that was chanted on a daily basis within the Source Family. According to the members’ testimonies, this was a variation of “Yahweh,” and the pronunciation was designed to intuitively sense the sacredness that resides in the sound. Therefore, Yahowha 13’s lyrics aimed for a meditative and magical effect rather than a literary meaning, and emphasized ““vibration’’ rather than meaning. Interpretation of death and its aftermathIn 1975, Yod died in a hang gliding accident, but his family said, ““He threw off his body,” and viewed his death not as sadness but as ““a transition to the next stage. ” After that, the members of Yahowha 13 continued their activities on a piecemeal basis, and from the 1990s onwards, they were reevaluated through reissues and documentaries. A book of testimonies, The Source: The Untold Story of Father Yod, YaHoWha 13, and The Source Family, describes the complex experience as both “destructive and liberating. ” Summary of supplementary interpretationsWhat emerges from the testimonies of members and their families is: Yahowha 13’s music is not a ““song” but a ““record of community prayer. ” The lyrics had a mantra-like power rather than meaning. Father Yod is not a performer, but a “spiritual conductor. ” Even after his death, his music continues to live on as a “spiritual legacy. ” In conclusionMore than just a “cult band,” Yahowha13/Father Yod left a strong impression on future generations as an unusual project that fused music, religion, and communal practices. His sound, which straddles the line between improvisation, ritual, madness and mystery, still provokes listeners even today. More than just psychedelic rock, Yahowha 13 and Father Yod’s music was a sonic ritual that embodied the hippie culture and community spirit of the 1970s. Under the guidance of Father Yod, Source Family members translated spiritual energy into sound through improvisation, with lyrics and chants that functioned more as mantra-like vibrations than literary meaning. His recordings, such as the albums Penetration: An Aquarian Symphony and I”m Gonna Take You Home, document a fusion of religious ritual and psychedelic improvisation that remains evocative even to modern listeners. It has been reevaluated in the United States as a document of cult history, in Germany as an acoustic experiment, and in Japan as an esoteric psychedelic religion, with each culture developing its own unique interpretations. Today, through streaming and reissues, Yahowha 13’s music is widely accessible, and their cult past has culminated in their influence on the contemporary music scene. The spirit of Father Yod and the experimental spirit of Source Family go beyond mere music and continue to challenge new generations to the possibilities of community, improvisation, and spirituality.

    "title": "[Column] Modern Brazil reflected by Bossa Nova: The intersection of music, architecture, technology, and fashion",
    "body": "Keyword is “Modernism”Text: mmr｜Theme: Considering the cultural spread of Bossa Nova, there are phenomena and things that seem unrelated at first glance, but are actually deeply connected. Bossa Nova, which sprouted in a small apartment in Rio de Janeiro in the late 1950s, quickly became Brazil’s new cultural banner and eventually spread around the world. The background to this is not only the appeal of the music itself, but also the deep resonance with the fields of architecture, technology, and fashion that were progressing at the same time. In this article, I would like to delve into the cultural connections between bossa nova and other fields, focusing on the activities of artists such as Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim. Bossa Nova and Brasilia architecture —— Modernism in cities and musicIn 1956, the futuristic city of Brasilia was built as part of a plan to relocate Brazil”s capital. Architect Oscar Niemeyer”s curvaceous and bold concrete structure showed the world a new image of Brazil. Coincidentally, around that time, João Gilberto changed music history with ““Chega de Saudade” and Antonio Carlos Jobim achieved international success with ““The Girl from Ipanema”. What architecture and music have in common is minimalism and sophistication. Just as Niemeyer stripped away decorations from buildings and depicted the future with curves and straight lines, Bossa Nova also expressed ““urban tranquility’’ with guitar arpeggios and whispering voices. Both were symbols of cultural modernism that promoted a “new Brazil,” and both played diplomatic roles in international cultural exchange during the Cold War. Bossa Nova and Technology —— Waves carried by radio and recordsAnother factor behind the spread of bossa nova was the technological innovations of the time. In the 1950s and 1960s, the expansion of radio broadcasting networks and the widespread use of LP records provided the perfect medium for bossa nova, a music that was more intimate and delicate than traditional samba. João Gilberto’s low-pitched vocals were more suited to home listening on the radio than to loud stadiums. Also, the reason that ““Getz/Gilberto’’ with Stan Getz became an international hit was due to the stereo recording technology that made the contrast between the jazz-like saxophone and the bossa nova-like guitar so clear. Furthermore, the new recording equipment of the time supported Antonio Carlos Jobim”s elaborate orchestration. This is how bossa nova became technology”s favorite music, making its way from Brazilian living rooms to New York clubs and cafes around the world. Bossa Nova and Fashion —— From the beach to the world stageIn the 1960s, Rio’s Ipanema and Copacabana beaches were the epicenter of young lifestyle and fashion. His attire, which included white shirts, light dresses, straw hats, and sandals, became established as a style that symbolized ““Brazilian modernity,’’ along with the light sound of bossa nova. Heloisa Pinheiro, the model for ““The Girl from Ipanema,” walked along the beach and was a perfect example of the fusion of fashion and music. Sergio Mendes’ stage costumes and the simple urban attire seen in bossa nova performances in the United States helped create a ““Cool Brazil” image in the international market. What’s even more interesting is that the spread of bossa nova was in sync with the global fashion trends of the 1960s, such as mod and minimal fashion. With their sophisticated melodies and simple costumes, they both shared a ““striped-down aesthetic. ’’ Conclusion —— Bossa Nova is a cultural crossroadsLooking at it this way, we can see that bossa nova was not just a music genre, but a comprehensive cultural phenomenon that symbolized modern Brazil, intersecting with architecture, technology, and fashion.    The curves of the future city drawn by Niemeyer’s architecture     Intimate sound expanded by records and radio     New fashion released along with beach culture  All of this is condensed into one note of João Gilberto”s guitar, Jobim”s harmonies, and the melody of “The Girl from Ipanema. ” The bossa nova you hear in cafes and lounges today is more than just soothing background music. Behind this is Brazil’s desire for “newness” in the second half of the 20th century, and a cultural resonance that goes beyond music.

In recent years, artists have been creating songs that incorporate elements of bossa nova, and fusion that transcends genre boundaries is progressing. summaryBossa Nova is a rare genre that began in an apartment in Rio de Janeiro in the late 1950s and has rewritten the world”s musical map. João Gilberto”s whispering guitar and voice, Antonio Carlos Jobim”s sophisticated compositions, Stan Getz”s jazz interpretation, and Sergio Mendes’ pop internationalism. Although their individual personalities and activities are independent, they are organically linked and continue to be listened to throughout the ages. Even today, the word “Bossa Nova” goes beyond just a musical genre and functions as a symbol of “Brazilian culture” and a “relaxed atmosphere. ” Through digital platforms such as Spotify and YouTube, it has been received freshly by the younger generation, and it frequently appears in AI recommendations and playlists. The charm of bossa nova lies in its unique musicality, which combines the freedom of jazz, the rhythm of samba, and the sense of harmony of classical music. Furthermore, if we look at its history, it also reflects social backgrounds such as international cultural exchange during the Cold War, urbanization in Brazil, and interaction with the American music market. By following albums and discography, as well as learning about anecdotes from the time and the lives of artists, you will be able to understand bossa nova more deeply. The music itself resonates as a soothing ““healing” sound, but at the same time, it can also be enjoyed as a ““document” that reflects the spirit of the times. That is the true value of the cultural heritage that is Bossa Nova. Related columns🔗 [Column] Modern Brazil reflected by Bossa Nova: the intersection of music, architecture, technology, and fashion "

    "body": "Beyond indie hip-hop, post-rock, electronica, and the art scene in general      Text: mmr   Theme: The history of experimental hip-hop/indie music by Anticon (founded in 1998) and the discography of major artists.    Anticon (anticon. ) is an American indie/experimental hip-hop label/collective founded in 1998. While many of the founding members expanded their scope of activities into “avant-garde hip-hop” and indie/electronica, crossing over between solo acts and derivative units, the label’s activities declined in the late 2010s after significant changes (departure of a co-founder, death of a member, etc. ). History and spirit — origins as “anti”Anticon was founded in 1998 with the likes of Sole (Tim Holland), Doseone (Adam Drucker), Jel (Jeffrey Logan), Odd Nosdam (David Madson), Pedestrian (James Brandon Best), and Yoni Wolf (Why?). The name comes from the word “ant-icon”, symbolizing resistance to established genres and commercial norms. Representative projects include cLOUDDEAD, Themselves, Subtle, and Deep Puddle Dynamics. Musical characteristics and transformationIn the early days, the band”s core was fragmentary, abstract, and even literary lyrics, which were described as ““avant-hip-hop” or ““hip-hop”s version of post-rock,” as well as an experimental orientation that made extensive use of samples, noise, and ambience. However, since the mid-2000s, the individual members have shifted towards indie rock, electronica, and pop, and as a result, Anticon has become less of a “single genre label” and more of a “group of individuals who resonate with each other. ” Representative Why? (Yoni Wolf) has deepened his melody-oriented songwriting, while Doseone and others have turned to performance-oriented projects. Anecdote/Turning Point   Sole’s departure (2010): Co-founder Sole announced his departure from Anticon in 2010. It is said that there were differences in business views and directions, but he commented that they would continue to work together on a personal basis.     Alias ​​Passes away (2018): Co-founder, producer/artist Alias ​​passed away suddenly in 2018. Since then, the label”s activities have dwindled, and one of its founding members, Sole, has stated that the label was dissolved after Alias’ death.

Legendary works by Slug, Sole, Alias ​​and others   Amazon   Influence in production/guest performanceThe members of Anticon collaborated extensively outside of their own label. For example, his remix work with Odd Nosdam and production/collaboration with Alias ​​intersect with artists from the post-rock and indie worlds. Anticon also became a hub for releases and tours from outsiders such as Buck 65 and Sage Francis, contributing to the formation of its own scene. Current status (2020s) and legacyThere are reports that the official website and activities have shrunk since 2018, and that “continuation as a label” has virtually ceased with the death of founding member Alias. However, individual artists (Why?, Doseone, Odd Nosdam, etc. ) continue to pursue solo careers or other labels, and Anticon’s musical influence remains strong in the indie/experimental music world today. The diaspora in the 2010s and the turning point in 2018 are good examples of how the “collective” called a label changes as individuals become more diverse. Deep dive: Highlights to listen toDecoration and deconstruction of words: Anticon style vocals often embellish words to shake up meaning and emotion. Lyric analysis (vocabulary frequency, theme changes) is also interesting from a cultural research perspective. Production Experimentality: Tracks that utilize field recordings, noise, and subtle ambience need to be listened to with a different metric than traditional beat-oriented hip-hop. Politics of community: The conflicts and resolutions of label management, ownership, and artistic policy are useful materials for thinking about the politics of indie music. Sole’s departure in 2010 and Alias’ disbandment following his death are important case studies. Reference (excerpt)   Tape Op / Interview article (Anticon production method)     Pitchfork: “Anticon Co-Founder Brendon Whitney (Alias) Dead at 41”     KQED: Anticon History and Cultural Impact  summaryAnticon was more than just a hip-hop label; it was a cultural experiment that proposed new possibilities for words and sounds, incorporating elements of experimental music, post-rock, and electronica. Key members such as Sole, Doseone, Jel, Alias, Odd Nosdam, and Why? continued to update their poetic expressions and sonic worlds through solo work, bands, and collaborations. At the core of its activities is an awareness of the ““expansion of underground hip-hop” from the late 1990s to the 2000s, and as a result, Anticon has taken on a strong character as an ““art collective,” ““independent lab,” and ““ideological community. ” cLOUDDEAD”s fantastic works, Why?”s pop-leaning albums, and the experimental productions of Alias ​​and Odd Nosdam continue to influence many listeners and musicians to this day. Although the label effectively came to an end in the late 2010s with the passing of Alias ​​and the scattering of members, its spirit continues to pulsate in the activities of each artist. Anticon’s genre-bending aesthetic has become one of the cornerstones of modern indie music and DIY culture, and has been passed down to a new generation of experimental artists on Spotify and Bandcamp. In other words, Anticon is a ““group that continued to experiment with the impossible’‘**, and their challenging attitude continues to live on in the music scene. "

Birth of Search &amp; DestroyWhile working at San Francisco’s City Lights bookstore, Vale founded Search &amp; Destroy with help from Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg. The aim was to convey the energy of the punk scene.     The DIY spirit of the Industrial Culture HandbookDirect interviews with Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire by phone and mail. The layout was completed by Vale using a typewriter and hand-delivering it to the printer.     Shock created by Modern PrimitivesIntroducing body modification as “art”. He elevated piercing and tattoo culture from taboo to culture. This directly led to later art events and performances.     Collaboration with John WatersJohn Waters provided many materials during the production of Incredibly Strange Films. ““Vale was the only place that treated my films as having cultural value,’’ he recalled.     Ballard special feature and subculture literatureIn 1988, he traveled to London to interview J. G. Ballard in person. Ballard said, ““I never thought that the people who would read my novels would be the punk generation. ’’     Funding difficulties and the continuation of zine cultureAlthough its circulation was small, its readership spread all over the world, and Vale said, ““A passionate readership is more important than mass circulation. ’’     Resonance with San FranciscoExperimental groups such as Survival Research Laboratories and Other Cinema gathered around RE/Search, building a network of zines and art.  summaryV. Vale’s RE/Search is more than just a magazine; it is a historical archive of subculture, and a cultural heritage that cross-cuts music, film, and art. He continues to explore a wide range of fields, from industrial to modern primitives, from cult films to cyberpunk, and his influence continues to ripple all over the world. For researchers and underground culture enthusiasts, RE/Search is a must-read. "

Its origins date back to 1984 with ““High Frontiers,” followed by ““Reality Hackers,” and in 1989 it became fully developed under the name ““Mondo 2000. ” The magazine featured themes such as ““biotech,” ““virtual reality,” ““smart drugs,” and ““neo-psychedelia,’’ with experimental graphics and irony. Who wrote it and what did they say?Key editors and publishers include R. U. Sirius (Ken Goffman), Queen Mu (Alison Bailey Kennedy), and hacker and editor Jude Milhon (St. Jude). Contributors of the cyberpunk and techno culture of the time, including William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Rudy Looker, and Douglas Rushkoff, contributed to the book, presenting pop intelligence that traversed music, literature, and technology.

The art direction was handled by Bart Nagel and others, and the magazine used a collage-like layout that took advantage of ““information overload’’ to provoke readers. These visual strategies have influenced later web culture and editorial design. Wikipedia Spread of activity — Magazines have created communitiesBeyond the magazine, Mondo 2000 also expanded its network through events, interviews, and collaborations. The editorial team connected with techno/club culture, psychedelic research, and transhumanism, forming much of the subcultural vocabulary of the 90s.

The stages and methods are diverse, such as performance art that foregrounded the DIY spirit of the 1970s and 1980s and the violence of machines and sound (e. g. Survival Research Laboratories), and groups that pushed tape collage/sampling culture to a popular level (e. g. Negativland). These activities led to live houses, art spaces, cassette/indie labels, and later festival culture. overviewThe San Francisco Bay Area has been an important hub for noise/experimental music from the late 1970s to the present.

The show, which used huge equipment and the sounds of fire, dust, and metal, clearly presented the “visibility” and “danger” of noise, and established the Bay Area as a “testing ground for sound and machinery. ” SRL’s activities are praised not only for expressing acoustic noise, but also for their perspective on industrial technology. NegativlandA group active in the San Francisco area and known for their media critical works that use sampling/collage. Works such as Escape From Noise from the late 1980s were important works that showed the intersection of noise and pop culture, attracting controversy and attention through DIY radio and fake advertising techniques. Matmos and local derivationMatmos was formed in San Francisco in the 1990s and gained international acclaim for their conceptual work that uses sampling. Since the 2000s, it has continued to lead the “conceptual side” of experimental music, strengthening its connections with art institutions and contemporary music festivals. Community and the field (Noise Pop, Bay Improviser, etc. )The Bay Area is home to indie festivals like Noise Pop and improvisational/experimental music communities like Bay Improviser, which are responsible for passing down expressions and venues for younger generations. These scenes circulate through the venue of “live” and provide a platform where old and new intersect. Main acts   Survival Research Laboratories (SRL) — Mechanical performance and fracture aesthetics. An organization that blurs the line between performance art and noise.     Negativland — A sound collage collective from San Francisco. Known for his media critical approach in the 1990s.

Even the sounds of everyday life (the sound of dishes and people’s laughter) were recorded, and these were made into the ““reality of that culture. ’’  Annea Lockwood   The “River Sound Map” series is made by thoroughly walking around the field and recording it like a scientific survey.     Due to the long duration of recording, the recording equipment was produced with careful consideration of its power supply and weather resistance.     Listening to his works gives you the experience of ““traveling through geographical movement with your ears. ’’  Hildegard Westerkamp   At the sound walk workshop, participants were instructed to ““Listen carefully to the sounds you are hearing right now. ’’     Spread the idea of ​​reconsidering urban noise as ““poetry of modern cities” rather than ““noisy garbage. ”  Toshiya Tsunoda   Apprehend the existence of sound as “spatial resonance. ”     Example: A microphone is installed in a cavity under the asphalt of a road to record minute vibrations.     The method is similar to a scientific experiment, but the results are converted into an aesthetic experience.  Francisco Lopez   Hand out “eye masks” to the audience and perform a performance in which they can listen to the sound in total darkness.     Aims to “erase the boundary between music and environmental sounds. ”     For his work ““La Selva,’’ he recorded the rainforest as it was, with minimal editing.  Chris Watson   Explored electronic music during his band days. After that, he joined the BBC and was in charge of recording nature programs.     “El Tren Fantasma” takes you on a journey through an abandoned railway, with detailed recordings of train running sounds and scenery sounds.     In bird recordings, there is an anecdote of a wild peregrine falcon waiting motionless for several days near its nest.  Bernie Krause   Formerly a synth player who was also involved with The Byrds and Doors.     After that, he turned to nature recording.     Proposed the concept of ““Nature’s Choir (Biophony)’’ and utilized recordings for environmental protection.  Ryuichi Sakamoto   In his later works, he clarified the idea that ““music is inseparable from the environment. ’’     Since 2011, he has also recorded local sounds from the Great East Japan Earthquake, deepening his interest in environmental sounds.     Regarding ““async,” he said, ““Music to leave behind fragments of time. ”  Anecdotes about each artist and equipmentAlan Lomax and Ampex   Ampex from the 1950s was very large and weighed several tens of kilograms.     Lomax used this as a mobile studio to record.     The biggest challenge is securing power, so a generator is used.  Chris Watson and Nagra / Sound Devices   So reliable that he says, ““I’ve never seen Nagra stop working. ’’     I use a super-directional microphone (Sennheiser MKH 416/816) when recording birds and animals.     I made my own ““waterproof bag + sand cloth’’ to protect my equipment from sand in the desert.  Nagra by Bernie Krause   The battery I carried on my back during my early nature recordings weighed over 10kg.      ”I’m more afraid of missing out than being tired,’’ he said.     Later, with the spread of DAT recorders and lightweight equipment, activities became dramatically more efficient.  Francisco López’s DAT   DAT recorders are popular for their high sound quality, but they are sensitive to humidity.     Tapes deteriorate due to mold in the rainforest, and recording may fail.     López takes on the challenge of ““leaving the equipment in the natural environment. ’’  Toshiya Tsunoda’s DIY Microphone   I made my own sensors and contact microphones to record the vibrations of the space itself.     The idea is to ““measure the resonance between air and objects” instead of ““listening to sound. ”     Always trying out ““unexpected uses’’ for commercially available equipment.  Ryuichi Sakamoto and his daily equipment   In his later years, he always carried pocket-sized Zoom H2n and Sony PCM recorders.

On the other hand, issues such as ethics (subject consent, cultural attribution) and selection of storage formats remain. If you want to incorporate field recording into your hobby or work, we recommend first going out into the field with reliable equipment and creating a workflow to properly manage and share the recorded sound.

    "body": "Zine is a record, zine is an expression, zine is an extension of rave      Text: mmr   Genre: Media culture/music archive   Theme: Zine as a preservation device for unrecorded culture   A zine is a small piece of media that you can create yourself. Zines were as present in the rave scene as they were in the ’90s punk scene, the feminist movement, and skater culture. A rave is a celebration of the moment, and zines are a great way to remember and share it with others. Enthusiasm burned into paperThe vibrations of my body that I felt on the club floor. An illegal rave that lasted until morning in a forest on the outskirts of the city. A wordless resonance exchanged in the infrared light surrounded by smoke. They are often not recorded. It is not reported in the media and is not recorded in history. However, a DIY media called ““Zine’’ is currently attracting attention as a means of picking up the fragments and retelling the story. A zine is not a magazine, diary, or report. However, it is closer to the “voices of the people involved” than any of these. In the rave culture, which inherently resists recording, zines have the potential to serve as ““memory aids. ’’ The problem of lack of rave recordsRave is a musical culture that emphasizes the experience of the here and now, and its nature makes it incompatible with media recording.       Reasons why it is difficult to record   Contents         Taboos on photography and recording were particularly strong at underground raves in the 1990s, and equipment was often prohibited from being brought in           Illegality/Anonymity   No records are kept to avoid detection by the police or government       Transient   Events on the floor disappear for a moment   Thus, the ““true image’’ of many raves does not remain. The lack of sound sources, images, and records threatens to disrupt cultural inheritance. What is a Zine? : Alternative records created by individualsZine is an abbreviation for “Magazine” and is an independent publication that anyone can create freely. It is a cultural entity that does not rely on printing technology or the Web, but instead relies solely on paper and copy machines. Features of Zine Trinitarian structure of editor = reader = stakeholder Free formats such as handwriting, cutting and pasting, collage, etc.  Any theme (music, politics, gender, personal experiences, essays, etc. ) A means for “recording and sharing” that has nothing to do with commercialismZine and rave affinityZines can be a ““means for reconstructing the experience’’ of unrecorded raves. Specific example      Method   Contents that can be recorded         Reposting the flyer   Preserving the visual culture of the time       Essay on the scene   Verbalize the mood and atmosphere of the scene       Set list record   DJ name, song order, flow of the scene       Sharing dangers and anecdotes   Drug experiences, check avoidance, and social tension   Examples: Rave Zines around the worldflowchart TDA[ Rave Zine ] --&gt; B[ Overseas ]  B --&gt; B1[ Datacide(Germany) ]B --&gt; B2[ Rave Flyer Archives(UK) ]      Region   Zine name   Features         Germany   Datacide   Critical rave zine with psychocore, breakcore, and political context       UK   Rave Flyer Archives   90’s flyer + personal essay   In the age of digital, why keep things on paper?

From the perspective of a raver and an archivist, I will pass on a culture that tends to disappear to future generations. Rave Archive Old School Rave Flyer Archives from 1989-2000 from across the US and Canada Oldschool Rave Flyer archive 1989-2000+ from all over the US &amp; Canada By Ernie Villalobos Archive of Old Rave Flyers Conclusion: Zines are the key to inheriting the culture that could not be recordedZines are neither commercial nor public records. However, because of this, it is possible to preserve ““moments that no one else would have recorded. ’’ It is a diary, a report, a testimony, and a love letter. As much of rave culture is lost, the memories left behind in the form of zines will become valuable fragments for future generations of listeners and dancers to rediscover the contours of the culture.

    "body": "Norwegian Disco: The Genealogy of Prins Thomas, Mungolian Jet Set and LindstrømText: mmr｜Theme: History of modern disco/space disco born in Norway, solo works, collaborations, produced works Despite its cold climate and Scandinavian tranquility, Norway has given rise to an important trend of warm disco/space disco. Prins Thomas, Lindstrøm, and the Mungolian Jet Set have reinterpreted 70s and 80s disco, Italo, and French touch with a Norwegian lens, giving 21st century dance music their own unique flavor. In this article, we will comprehensively introduce each artist’s solo work, collaboration, and production activities, and list recommended albums by age group. Overview: Scandinavian air and “temperature” discoThe disco created by Norwegian producers is more than just retro playback. The melancholy produced by the cold climate and the fusion of warm synth/percussion–this contrast is the flavor of “Nordic disco. ” Prins Thomas and Lindstrøm influenced each other, expanding the vocabulary of “space disco” through co-writing and remixing. Mungolian Jet Set, on the other hand, also incorporates elements from outside Norway (including the introduction of music samples from Asia and the Middle East) in its DJ mixes and extraordinary music curation. flowchart TDPT[Prins Thomas]LS[Lindstrøm]MJ[Mungolian Jet Set]ST[Smalltown Supersound]DT [Disko B / Internasjonale collaboration]PT --&gt;|Co-production/Remix| LSLS --&gt;|Produced| OtherArtists[Diverse artists]MJ --&gt;|DJ Mix / Curation| PTPT --&gt;|Label/Compilation| STST --&gt; DTCommentary by artistPrins ThomasHis real name is Thomas Moen Hermansen.

In addition, the collaborations and remix work released with Lindstrøm and others contributed to the formation of the scene. Main activities produced/involved:  Co-production with Lindstrøm (split/remix) Long track using modular/analog equipment Curation of live sets at small festivals and clubsLindstrømHis real name is Hans-Peter Lindstrøm. His sound is called the standard-bearer of “cosmic disco,” and combines synth layers, heavy drum work, and the essence of ambient. His masterpieces, such as ““Where You Go I Go Too” and ““It’s A Fidelity Affair,” have received high acclaim for their elegant and danceable long-length compositions. Main activities produced/involved:  Remixes of other artists (female singers and indie bands) Music production for video works and fashion eventsMungolian Jet SetMainly active as a DJ unit/producer. He is known for his vast record knowledge and mixes that incorporate a sense of tribal rhythm. Their Jet Set Trax-like mix series brings a new editorial perspective to the Norwegian club scene. Member compositionPaul “Strangefruit” Nyhus Role: DJ/Turntablist/Selector Features: An important presence in Norway’s underground DJ culture. With a unique music selection based on his extensive record collection, he freely connects disco, jazz, Afro, house, and experimental music. Known as a DJ who breaks down genre barriers, he brings an electric element to Mungolian Jet Set’s work. Knut Sævik Role: Producer/Musician Features: An engineer who supports studio work. He is in charge of rich sound design, making full use of synthesizers, samplers, programming, etc. Jazz andHe brings his classical background and adds depth to his arrangements. Guest Collaborator Randy Barracuda (active in Finland’s Skweee scene) and singers/musicians from Norway and abroad sometimes participate. Mungolian Jet Set’s albums and mixes also feature guest vocalists and instrumentalists.

Cross-cultural references: Free references to Italo, French disco, and even folk music elements. lastlyPrins Thomas, Lindstrøm, and Mungolian Jet Set continue to send out ““temperature disco’’ from Norway to the world. Given their musical background and production work, their tracks go beyond mere dance music and provide a listening experience tinged with a Scandinavian sense of time/landscape. "

    "body": "Memories of art and themes carved in the desertText: mmr｜Theme: To know the history of Burning Man is to understand that it is more than just a festival, it is a “future city and human experiment” Burning Man is more than just a festival, it”s a testing ground for collaboratively creating a Black Rock City. It began on the beaches of the San Francisco Bay Area in 1986, and since the 1990s has been held annually in Nevada”s Black Rock Desert. It”s a place where art, fire, technology, and a culture of gifting intersect, intersecting deeply with the Bay Area”s corporate and startup culture. BURNING MAN 2025 - All ARTOrigin and development: from the beach to the desertBurning Man began in 1986 when Larry Harvey and Jerry James burned a wooden effigy (The Man) at Baker Beach in San Francisco. From there, the number of participants increased, and after moving to the Black Rock Desert for the first time in 1990, the event transformed into a temporary city-building project in the desert. 2004 “10 Principles” and their impactAs the organization evolved, the ““10 Principles” (Radical Inclusion, Gifting, Decommodification, etc. ) proposed by Larry Harvey in 2004 organized the community’s values ​​and provided a cultural framework for the event. This is the ““ideological core” of Burning Man and has spread to regional burns around the world. Relationship with Bay Area/TechBurning Man has a long relationship with Silicon Valley. In the late 1990s, research points out that Burning Man has been used as a cultural infrastructure by the Bay Area”s creative industries, with anecdotes of participation by Google”s founders. The Stanford et al. study argues that Burning Man became the cultural foundation for a “new media industry. ” Participation and controversy of famous people/celebritiesBurning Man has long been a magnet for celebrities — entrepreneurs, artists, and even politicians (names like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos have been mentioned in the media). This can create friction between the principle of “decommodification” and the actual behavior of participants with wealth and influence. Anecdote/LegendWhen it was relocated in 1990, a police ban on burning on beaches was a turning point, and the decision was made to move to the desert. Burning Man An interesting story that the roots of “Google Doodle” are related to the founder’s vacation announcement at Burning Man (the intersection of corporate culture and festivals).

Burning Man 2025: The Man BurnsTheme by year (overview)Since 1996, the event has had an “art theme” each year (for example, “The Body” in 2000). Themes give direction to artists’ and camps’ expressions and serve as triggers for dialogue in public spaces. The official archive records the yearly themes and installed art.

The values ​​that ““find value in the experience itself’’ permeated the participants, and supported the formation of later large-scale art works and themed cities. 1997: Fertility1997 was the year that Burning Man’s symbolism of nature, life, and rebirth became the central theme for the first time. The prototype of the “celebration of life and creativity” that has been inherited by subsequent themes (2004 Vault of Heaven, 2012 Fertility 2. 0, etc. ). 1998: Nebulous EntityA theme that explores mysterious existence and the ambiguity of the universe and consciousness. Interactive works using participatory levitation or light stood out. For example, it has been reported that there is a work called ““30-foot luminous float ‘Nebulous Entity. ’’ 1999: The Wheel of TimeThe theme of the wheel of time/circularity. The city blocks and streets have been renovated with planet motifs. 2000: The BodyThe theme is the expression and symbolism of the human body and body. There are many installations that test physicality, aesthetics, and the limits of the body. Also, from this year, temple installations began to take hold, and installations that combined spirituality and structure, such as the ““Temple of the Mind’’ (or similar concepts), appeared. 2001: Seven AgesThemes deal with the seven stages of life, growth and change, and intergenerational relationships. In some cases, structures have been set up to symbolize the transition of life through multiple art and performances. 2002: The Floating WorldWith the motif of the floating world, the art is constructed from the perspective of expanding the temporary world and the extraordinary. A structure with an underwater sensation, floating sensation, and fantasy appears. 2003: Beyond BeliefAn exploration of religiosity, faith, mystery, illusion and transcendence. Both the theme and the art have more compositions that are conscious of ritual, prayer, and ceremonial spaces. This year, the number of projects registered as theme art increased rapidly. 2004: The Vault of Heaven2004 was the year when “cosmic vision” and “community prayer” were combined, and it is credited with being the forerunner of subsequent science/space themes such as “Cargo Cult (2013)” and “I, Robot (2018). ” NASA engineers from the Bay Area and people from the MIT Media Lab also participated, making it a symbolic example of the trinity of “science x art x spirituality. ” 2005: PsycheWith the theme of xinxing/spiritual world, many works have appeared that deal with dreams, unconsciousness, and introspection. 2006: Hope &amp; FearA theme that explores the conflicting axes of hope and fear. There were structures and media art that hinted at the fragility of human civilization and future orientation. 2007: The Green ManA theme that reconsiders the relationship between nature and civilization. A composition based on the motif of the “Green Man” (an anthropomorphic figure of plants and naturally occurring plants). However, in that year, his burning art ““Crude Awakening,’’ which imitated a giant oil rig, caused controversy and was criticized. 2008: American DreamAmerican Dream/Questions about consumer society. There is a lot of art featuring themes of consumerism, mythology, and social structure. 2009: Evolution – A Tangled BankThe themes are evolution, ecosystems, interbreeding, and interrelationships. The focus is on art that imitates complex structural arrangements and life networks. 2010: Metropolis – The Life of CitiesUrban theory: A theme that explores the vitality of cities. Art was developed that questioned architectural elements, the microcosm and arrangement of urban structures, and the interrelationship between cities and humans. 2011: Rites of PassageThe themes are rites of passage, transition, and transformation. Festival-like installations with elements of individual life changes and collective ritual spaces stood out. 2012: Fertility 2. 0A re-examination and update of 1997’s “Fertility”. The theme is creativity, rebirth, and budding into the future. 2013: Cargo CultUsing the cargo cult (the gap between material culture and faith) as a motif, we re-examine modern consumer society, cargo distribution, and ritualization. Many of the camps and structures express the gap between the “material being worshiped” and the “gift economy. ” 2014: CaravansaryThe motif is a caravanserai (caravanserai/trading post). The art was composed around the themes of movement of people and goods, trade, journeys and stops, and cultural exchange. 2015: Carnival of MirrorsThe theme of the carnival of mirrors is device, reflection, and illusion. Features mirrored structures, visual tricks, and festival-like devices. 2016: Da Vinci”s WorkshopA theme that explores art, engineering, invention, and fusion with reference to the Italian Renaissance. The component that intersects creativity and technology has been strengthened. 2017: Radical RitualWith the theme of reconstructing ceremoniality and ceremoniality, emphasis is placed on ritual performances by participants and the construction of interactive festival spaces. 2018: I, RobotThe theme is robots, machines, artificial intelligence, and autonomy. Many works featuring cyberpunk style, mechanical structures, and interactive robotics appear. 2019: MetamorphosesFocusing on metamorphosis, metamorphosis, and transformation, dynamic change, material transformation, and mold-breaking art expressions stand out. 2020: The MultiverseOriginally, the theme was the multiverse concept. However, due to COVID-19, the local festival was canceled. Exploring development in virtual/online space. 2021: ReflectiveA hybrid/virtual/physical fusion approach with the theme of “reflection and reflection” amid restrictions on on-site events. 2022: Waking DreamsWith the theme of awakening and awakening, the composition was created with an awareness of the fluctuations between dreams and reality and the awakening perspective. 2023: AnimaliaThe theme is animality, wildness, and resonance with the animal world. The motifs are questions about ecosystems, physicality, and interspecies relationships. 2024: The Great UnknownThe theme is unknown and unpredictability, and a challenging composition is developed that visualizes uncertainty through art. 2025: Tomorrow TodayFocusing on the near future, future inventions, and social plans. Art that embodies “Tomorrow into Today”, prototyping, and design that induces a futuristic dialogue space. Notes and supplementary explanationsThe above list was constructed by referring to the theme descriptions from Burning Man’s official annual archive, as well as multiple fan and record sites. The Temple (a place of prayer) and the Man itself are often designed in response to a theme, with elements that are independent of the theme but reconfigured every year. Furthermore, the theme is not necessarily compulsorily applied to all camps/works, but rather functions as a “suggestionary framework”. Conclusion: Future city experiment in the desertBurning Man is a modern cultural experimental city that has evolved from Inferno (1995) → Decommodification (1996) → Fertility (1997) → Vault of Heaven (2004) → 2010–2025 theme, fusing spirituality, participatory art, decommercialization, and life expression. The theme, which changes every year, and the large-scale artwork function as a device for participants to question their values ​​and social relationships through their experiences. The ephemeral cities built in the desert are etched in the memories of individuals and continue to have a lasting impact on society, culture, and creativity. That’s the essence of Burning Man: even when the desert bonfires go out, the spirit continues to burn into the next year and into our imaginations. "

Organize solo works, production work, and bands involved (Flying Lizards, This Heat, etc. ) by year.    Cunningham’s method consists in ““deconstruction of pop songs” and ““using the studio as part of the songwriting process. ” Creating a sense of discomfort with simple riffs and catchy melodies through artificially awkward performances, mechanical processing, and tape collages—this is the essence of his “humorous experiments. ” As a result, we have created a unique sound image that sits diagonally above the post-punk/new wave context. Who is David Cunningham?David Cunningham (1954–) is a producer/composer known as the man behind The Flying Lizards. As a bridge between experimental music and pop culture, they left a unique mark on the post-punk scene of the late 1970s.

Amazon Search   This Heat — Discography and Cunningham InvolvementLondon in the late 1970s. This Heat made Cold War anxieties sound, and David Cunningham supported its recordings. Here, we will analyze the lyrics of each song from a socially critical point of view, and delve deeper into Cunningham’s recording techniques and equipment. Relationship with This HeatThis Heat (1976–82) was an experimental rock band from London consisting of Charles Hayward, Charles Burrell, and Gareth Williams. Cunningham was deeply involved in recording and editing, providing technical support for the introduction of tape loops, feedback, and acoustic collage. In particular, working in the Cold Storage Studio (an experimental studio converted from a refrigerated warehouse) became a place where Cunningham could demonstrate his technical skills. Cutting and splicing tapes, playing them backwards, and disassembling recording into 24 tracks gave rise to sounds that would later become directly connected to the post-rock and noise scene. Lyric interpretation (Cold War criticism and social satire)“This Heat” (1979) “Not Waving”: The title recalls a poem by Stevie Smith. Symbolizing individual loneliness and national alienation.  “24 Track Loop”: No lyrics, but expresses the “mechanical repetition of capitalism” with sound. The infinite loop is a metaphor for the ““stagnation of the times. ’’ “Horizontal Hold”: Quoted from TV terminology. A satire of “information manipulation” and “mass media control” during the Cold War. “Health and Efficiency” (1980) “Health and Efficiency”: Although the title seems positive at first glance, the lyrics are full of ironic phrases about the “energy crisis” and “the health myth of industrial society. ” An ironic anthem that takes a Cold War era slogan and turns it on its head. “Deceit” (1981)The band’s best work. The whole theme is fear and lies (Deceit) about nuclear war during the Cold War.  “Sleep”: The lullaby-like lyrics whispering “sleep in peace” are actually ironic as “the world collapses while you sleep. ” “Cenotaph”: Title referring to the Cenotaph. An indictment of the folly of humanity, which remembers and repeats wars.  “A New Kind of Water”: New water = radioactive contamination. A metaphor for nuclear testing and nuclear war.  “Independence”: It screams independence and freedom, but the lyrics are full of contradictions. Criticizes the fiction of nationalism. “Made Available (Peel Sessions)” (1983)The lyrics were clearer than the studio version, and the social commentary was delivered directly to listeners through the BBC broadcast. David Cunningham’s recording techniques and equipmentRevox Tape Machine Make full use of Revox A77/B77 to perform tape loop and speed modulation.  Core equipment for infinite loop processing using tape, such as “24 Track Loop”.  Tape editing (cut &amp; splice) connects different fragments and creates non-linear song structures. Studer 24 Track Recorder Installed at Cold Storage Studio in London.  Record each instrument individually and edit/layer them later.  Cunningham developed the idea of ​​”“turning the studio into an instrument’’ and later reconfigured the sessions.  This allows improvisation to become a “constructed composition. ”Analog EQ and Outboard Uses Neve and Trident style EQ.  The band’s lively performance is purposefully ““distorted” and ““spatially arranged” to emphasize its experimental nature.  It was used to create an “acoustic discomfort” rather than a standard correction. Field recording equipment Record environmental sounds with portable Revox or Nagra.  Collage of factory sounds, city noises, and everyday sounds into songs.  Noticeable in the environmental sound processing of “Health and Efficiency”. Technological deep dive — turning the studio into a political spaceCunningham and This Heat weren’t just a sonic experiment, they practiced criticism through recording.  “Mechanical repetition” of tape loops = endless cycle of capitalism Voice distorted by EQ = distortion of national propaganda Non-linear structure with 24-track editing = historical discontinuation and repetitionThe studio was not just a recording space, but a testing ground for translating Cold War criticism into sound.

Cunningham’s recording philosophy: Uses equipment such as Revox, Studer, and EQ as “political metaphorical devices. ” Historical significance of experimental music: Beyond post-punk, it is directly connected to the foundations of modern sampling/DAW culture and even AI music production. Their music is still a group of works that should be reevaluated as ““recording = criticism = experiment. ’’ David Cunningham himself was more than just an eccentric post-punk innovator; he was an innovator in recording technology. This Heat’s music, which utilizes equipment such as Revox and Studer and presents lyrics and sonic structures critical of the Cold War, would not have been possible without his tape manipulation and multitrack editing. That legacy laid the foundations for today’s noise, post-rock, and experimental sound, and continues to take on new relevance in the era of AI-powered sonic reconstruction.

    "body": "At first glance, the two seem unrelated. Text: mmr｜Theme: The affinity between recent fashion shows and noise music Noise music is all about underground live houses, sweat and feedback sounds, and extreme performances. High-end brands, on the other hand, are the runways of Paris, Milan, and Tokyo, shiny textiles, and the height of sophistication. It is easy to think that the two cannot intersect. However, if you look at fashion shows in recent years, you will find that the two have built a surprisingly close relationship. Intimacy between fashion show and noiseSince the 1990s, high-end brand shows have actively introduced not only rock and classical music, but also noise/industrial music. Balenciaga made industrial noise roar in a ruin-like space, presenting clothing and space as ““aggressive beauty. ’’ Rei Kawakubo of COMME des GARÇONS has been drawn to experimental music since the 1980s, and has layered repetition and dissonance into fashion. Yohji Yamamoto alternated between tranquil classical music and roaring noise in his show, acoustically visualizing the “white space” and “excess” of clothing. Noise becomes a device that emphasizes the dismantling of fashion’s existing beauty through the ““denial of harmony. ’’ Paradoxical affinity — anti-commercial becomes brand valueNoise originally developed as an antithesis to capitalism and commercial music. What Merzbow and Hijikadan embody is ““outside the framework of the music industry. ’’But ironically, it’s this “anti-commercial” attitude that makes it an attractive poison for brands. Just as Vivienne Westwood incorporated punk into capitalism, noise is also used as a ““foreign substance for brands to differentiate themselves. ’’ In other words, rebellion is transformed into a nourishing source of luxury. Anecdotes and specific episodesThe footage from Hijokaidan was used as a visual production material for a European fashion brand, emphasizing the ““coexistence of chaos and sophistication. ’’ GUCCI mixed industrial noise into the campaign video, intentionally creating a conflict with classical music. Rick Owens introduced drone-like noises to his shows in the 2010s, lulling the audience into an “uncomfortable immersion. ” Yoji Yamamoto said in an interview, ““Clothing requires silence, but sometimes a roar that destroys that silence is useful. ’’ Contemporary significance — noise to create instabilityFashion in the 21st century faces the risks of ““mass consumption” and ““high-speed circulation. ”Therefore, noise emphasizes ““instability” and ““uniqueness” as a counter to homogenization. Roars and noises make the audience uncomfortable and arouse, proving that the brand is a ““provocateur. ’’ Brand and Noise/Experimental Music Case Studies      Brand   Music/Artists used   Characteristics of the production         COMME des GARÇONS   Drone, noise, minimal   “Deconstruction of beauty” through dissonance       Yohji Yamamoto   Drone-like improvisation inspired by Keiji Haino   Contrast between silence and roar       Balenciaga   Industrial noise, environmental sounds   Production that evokes war and collapse       Rick Owens   Drone noise, low frequency sound   Ritual immersive experience       Gucci   Classical + electronic noise   Collision of extravagance and foreign sensation       Vivienne Westwood   Punk-noise sound   Branding anti-establishment aesthetics       Prada   Environmental sounds, white noise   Symbolization of the extraordinary       Alexander McQueen   Classical + electronic noise   A production that symbolizes the collapse of beauty   Each brand’s approach to noiseIn-depth examples of major brands and noise ✦ COMME des GARÇONS Rei Kawakubo pursues the affinity between “deconstruction of beauty” and noise.

However, both share an aesthetic that deconstructs and reconstructs beauty. Noise tears apart the pretensions of luxury and paradoxically strengthens its brand value. The roar that echoes on the runways of the 21st century is proof that brands are not ““existences to be consumed” but ““existences that provoke. ” Related columns🔗 [Column] History and masterpieces of Experimental Music: From its origins to the present 🔗 [Column] Noise Music — From its origins to the present: Historical background, famous records, and changes in equipment "

    "title": "[Column] Rave and media: Archiving unrecorded music culture",
    "body": "Music that was supposed to disappear      Text: mmr   Genre: Cultural records/media considerations   Theme: Chasing the traces of disappearing music   Rave was an ad-hoc celebration of sound and light, and was basically a culture that did not assume that it would be recorded. Rave, whether in a club or outdoors, is a here-and-now experience, destined to be forgotten and never archived. However, in the 21st century, with the advent of YouTube, SNS, and archive sites, ““cultures that were supposed to be unrecorded’’ are beginning to be recorded and reevaluated. This change is extremely interesting from both media and music culture perspectives. Rave, a space without media● The essence of rave is “anti-media” Rave culture in the 1990s (particularly underground raves in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan) avoided media exposure and documentation. Legal risks (illegal parties and drug problems) Rebellion against commercialism (not “music that sells”) The “physical experience” at that moment is everything (realized from records) In other words, the rave was “live” in every sense of the word. It was aesthetics and politics to distance yourself from the media. Unrecorded music culture● Examples of what was lost: DJ set (recording was prohibited at the time) On-site VJ video and lighting production Venue air, smoke, smell, temperature Nonverbal interaction between spectators Rave was not a sound source or score, but a phenomenon itself. Therefore, such records have fundamentally different challenges than ordinary music archives. Who archives? Media deterioration● Spontaneous archive from the underground Since the 2000s, the following attempts have begun around the world. MixesDB, Discogs: Information collection of setlists and minor sound sources YouTube/SoundCloud: Upload old mixtapes and pirated recordings Reddit, Forum, Blog: Verbalization of experiences at the time Zine/Podcast/Documentary: Preservation movement with a DIY spirit These are grassroots archives that fill areas not covered by traditional music media (magazines, labels, broadcasters). Disruption and restoration of club culture● The reason why there are few records in Japan According to the Entertainment Business Law, clubs were classified as “entertainment businesses. ” It was easy to avoid taking photos and videos (especially in Shibuya and Roppongi) Magazine media (such as ““LOUD” and ““ele-king”) could only follow a limited scope. As a result, the Tokyo rave of the 1990s only exists “in memory. ” ● Recent developments Citizen movement to preserve club culture (review of entertainment business law) “Japan Rave Archive” and Zine projects are starting up Archive of past footage of Shibuya WOMB and ageHa Aggressive archiving is underway overseas Established in 2007, “Rave Archive” is an archive that preserves and shares memories of 90s rave culture. From the perspective of a raver and an archivist, I will pass on a culture that tends to disappear to future generations. Don’t miss the Archive of Old Rave Flyers from 1989-2000 from across the U. S. and Canada. The value of “irregular archives” in the digital ageMany of the archives we rely on today are “unauthorized. ” ・Mixtape with no label    Low quality video imported from VHS     Anonymous user memory-based setlists  However, this is also the most vivid means of preserving the ““reality of the place’’ at rave. Rather than institutionalized cultural heritage, a collection of “fragments of memories” pulsating underground is now becoming a single “cultural heritage. ” Conclusion: How to preserve unrecorded cultureRave was an “art of experience. ” It is impossible to record this and pass it on to future generations using normal music archiving methods alone. However, the accumulation of memories, fragments, reinterpretations, and “passion” is making this possible. The time has come for those of us who have grown up with media to go beyond media and reconsider how we archive culture.

    "body": "Is the euro pop? Is it underground?Text: mmr｜Genre: Music culture study｜Theme: The intersection between the Euro and clubs in the 90s Euro music, represented by ““Eurobeat” and ““Eurodance,” is a genre that dominated clubs and charts in the 1990s, but it is often misunderstood as ““light music. ’’ However, in reality, it was a hybrid existence born at the intersection of mass media, centered on radio, and underground rave culture. This article explores the role that Euromusic played between the club scene and popular music from two contexts: radio and rave. Radio and MTV: the expansion of the euro through mass media● “Turning dance music into a public good” In the late 1980s and early 1990s, radio stations rapidly increased the number of channels specializing in dance music, and Euro music began to penetrate households. Particularly in Western Europe, radio stations such as ““Radio NRJ (France)” and ““Radio 538 (Netherlands)” play a central role. ● Television penetration of Euro dance Due to the establishment of MTV Europe (1987), it was distributed as a set with visuals. High-quality music videos by artists such as Real McCoy, Culture Beat, and 2 Unlimited resonated with American viewers and entered the Billboard charts as a reimport. ● Parapara, J-WAVE, Super Eurobeat In Japan, J-WAVE and Bay FM actively broadcast the euro. In conjunction with avex’s ““Super Eurobeat’’ series, it created a Euro phenomenon that crosses clubs and TV commercials. Rave and subculture: the face of the underground Euro● Connection with rave culture Euromusic originally inherited sounds that originated in gay clubs, such as ““Italo Disco” and ““Hi-NRG. ” Then, in the 1990s, it resonated with the explosion of rave culture. Germany: Many euro-taste tracks played on Love Parade and Mayday UK: Hardbag and Euro-House styles appeared in garage sets in the mid-90s. Netherlands: The boundaries between Speed ​​Garage and Hard Trance are blurring ● Development of Dark Euro/Eurotrance Contrary to the commercial aspect, heavy Euro trance and Industrial Euro are also well-established at rave. Artists such as Cosmic Gate and Scooter have broken through boundaries. Musical Crossroads: The Technical Fusion of Euro vs. Club Tracks      Elements   Euro Music   Club Culture         Principal   Producer/Composer   DJ/Organizer       Format   Song unit (single-oriented)   Long play, mix-oriented       Composition   Emphasis on melody, A melody, B melody structure   Emphasis on groove, minimal development       Conductor   Radio, TV, CD   Parties, festivals, vinyl       Exchange point   Collaboration on 12-inch remixes, DJ edits, dub mixes, etc.        Although these two cultures may seem contradictory, they were loosely connected through mix CDs, vinyl culture, and the remix market. “Mix CD” culture as an intersection● Roles like Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold, DJ Bobo and more Curation as a DJ provides “euro discernment” Although it is a commercial package, the song selection has a club flair. ● Bridge from Euro to Trance Eurotrance, a junction between Euro dance and trance, appears in the Late 90”s. ATB, Fragma, Darude and more present a sound that weaves between pop and club Why is it being reevaluated now?In the 2020s, the 90s euro is being rediscovered on TikTok and YouTube. The reasons behind this are as follows. Melodic and clear structure matches the “instant viewing era” The ““rave feeling’’ of that time is reused as a sampling source by modern club producers. Nostalgic yet functional sound for open air and festival scenes Conclusion: Euro lived on the border between “pop” and “club”Euro music was not just ““easy-going chart music” or ““hard club tracks. ”Its true value lies in the music that maintained a balance between media and underground, melody and rhythm, system and physicality. Listen to it on the radio and dance in the club. That may have been the most “correct” way to spend the euro in the 1990s.

    "body": "“West” and “East” hidden in hard rockText: mmr｜Theme: Exploring the relationship between hard rock, Eastern philosophy, and mysticism through the examples of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple Hard rock is a major genre of rock that exploded from the late 1960s to the 1970s. Its musicality is characterized by its bold incorporation of Eastern philosophy and mystical elements, in addition to Western machoism and strength. Occultism of Led Zeppelin and Jimmy PageLed Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page is more than just a rock guitarist, he is known for his deep devotion to the world of occultism and mysticism. In particular, he had a keen interest in the study of Aleister Crowley, an early 20th century magician and thinker. Page actually purchased Crowley’s former residence, Boleskine House, and is said to have studied his thoughts and rituals. This fact is not just an urban legend, but a highly confirmed episode that has been mentioned by multiple music journalists and biographers. Furthermore, these occult and mystical elements are strongly reflected in Zeppelin”s songs and stage productions. For example, “Stairway to Heaven” has lyrics full of religious and mystical symbolism, reminding the listener of a “journey into the spiritual world. ” Page”s guitar style also gave his improvisations a mystical quality that had the power to lull the audience into a trance-like state. In other words, he incorporated occultism not just as a hobby or image, but as the basis of musical expression itself. Deep Purple and Rainbow Oriental ScaleOn the other hand, another trend in hard rock can be seen in the introduction of oriental scales and mystical sounds. Although Deep Purple is rooted in classical music and blues, they occasionally incorporate exotic melodies to give their songs an exotic feel. In particular, Ritchie Blackmore’s guitar playing includes many phrases reminiscent of Indian music and Arabic scales. This trend becomes even more evident in Rainbow, which was formed by Blackmore. Their signature song “Stargazer” combines oriental scale with mystical lyrics and grand orchestration. This song goes beyond just hard rock; it has a sense of scale, as if it were a musical expression of a grand myth or epic poem. In addition, during the live performance, the production made full use of fire and light, emphasizing the mystical view of the world and providing the audience with an ““otherworldly experience. ’’ In this way, the music of Deep Purple and Rainbow was not simply an extension of Western rock, but could be said to have created a new musical language by actively introducing Eastern thought and mystical imagery. Their efforts had a great influence on later metal and progressive rock, building a lineage of “mystical hard rock” that continues to this day. Seen in this way, Led Zeppelin’s occult explorations and the introduction of Eastern musical scales by Deep Purple and Rainbow are both elements that elevated hard rock into more than just a musical genre, but a cultural phenomenon.

As a result, we have built a ““rich musical ground’’ that can be applied to movie soundtrack production and the latest AI music generation. Influence of mysticism and oriental thoughtHard rock is not just rebellious music, but also contains philosophical and mystical elements. In particular:  Introducing Oriental scales (pentatonic, raga) to create a unique sound.  The lyrics often use mystical symbols (dragons, fire, contrast between light and darkness).  Meditative sounds explore the spiritual world rather than just releasing energy. These characteristics give listeners an ““otherworldly experience’’ and are still utilized today in the production of soundtracks for movies and game music.

The ““mystical chord progressions” and ““introduction of oriental scales” found in hard rock can be taught to AI and provide hints for creating unique songs. Actual application example Metal sound incorporating oriental scales → Perfect for game BGM Drone sound that creates a mysterious mood → For movie trailers Cinematic AI-generated soundtrack → Applied to science fiction and fantasy worksFAQ**Q1: ​​What is the difference between hard rock and heavy metal? **A1: Hard rock is an extension of blues rock and retains a strong sense of groove and rock”n”roll elements. Heavy metal, on the other hand, is more aggressive and tends to emphasize riffs and speed. **Q2: In what specific musical elements does Eastern thought appear? **A2: We express “exoticism” and “mysticism” by utilizing oriental scales such as pentatonic scales and ragas (Indian music modes). **Q3: Can hard rock be recreated with AI music generation? **A3: Yes. By having AI learn the musical characteristics of Zeppelin and Deep Purple, it is possible to recreate the mystique and power of hard rock. **Q4: Is hard rock suitable for soundtrack production? **A4: Yes. Ideal for creating a powerful and mysterious atmosphere, especially during battle scenes and climaxes. summaryHard rock is more than just “loud rock”; it is a unique cultural phenomenon that is a fusion of Western machismo and Eastern mysticism. Its essence is still applied today in the world of soundtrack production for movies and games, and the ever-evolving world of AI music generation. This allows us to connect the musical heritage of the past with the technology of the future, opening up new musical possibilities.

An ear that transcends genres: David Toop Changes in musical thinking “Music shouldn’t be confined to genres. If you open your ears, everything becomes music. ”― David Toop 1970s - Between improvisation and avant-gardeHaving established himself in London’s free improvisation scene, Toop began his career as a critic while performing as a guitarist. For him, music was not a form or style, but the act of listening itself. During this period, he had already developed an attitude of transcending genre boundaries.

Rather than consuming other cultures as “decoration,” a methodology has emerged that expands the experience of sound. He truly viewed music as a ““sound map of the world. ’’       Year   Featured sound sources/artists   Commentary         1981   Environmental Sound Recordings   Introducing an approach to presenting natural and urban sounds as music.        1983   Jon Hassell – Fourth World Vol. 1   Toop critically supports “Fourth World music” that fuses Western and non-Western music.

Around the same time, he discussed ambient and jungle, and was actively involved in cultural criticism of electronic music. It can be said that this was the era when Toop’s style, which combines criticism and a sense of the field, was established.

    "body": "Progressive rock and anime: a grand narrative that intersectsText: mmr｜Theme: Progressive rock that has a high affinity with anime When we talk about the relationship between anime and music, genres that are directly connected come to mind, such as J-Pop, idol songs, Eurobeat, and electronica. However, if you dig a little deeper, you will find that it has a surprisingly strong affinity with progressive rock. On the surface, it may seem distant from “anime songs,” but its long structure, difficult rhythms, and concept album-like storytelling actually resonate in many ways with the characteristics of the anime medium. ■ Overview of the correlation between progressive rock and anime by age groupflowchart TDP1970[ 1970s: The golden age of prog rock (Pink Floyd, Yes)\\nJapanese anime is the rise of space opera (Yamato, Gundam) ]P1980[ 1980s: Progressive rock decline and divergence (Neo Prog, Prog Metal)\\nAnime deepens OVA culture and SF (Crusher Joe, AKIRA) ]P1990[ 1990s: Under the influence of post-progressive rock (Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater)\\nThe rise of philosophical anime (Neon Genesis Evangelion) ]P2000[ 2000s: Post-rock/prog metal fusion\\nAnime: Ghost in the Shell S.

Typical features are as follows.  Long composition: It is not uncommon for one song to last over 10 minutes, and the entire song unfolds like an epic poem.  Difficult rhythms and odd time signatures: A complex rhythm structure that challenges the listener brings intellectual stimulation that is different from the “comfort” of regular pop music.  Conceptuality: In many cases, the entire album tells a single story or theme, often accompanied by a science fiction/fantasy worldview. These elements naturally overlap with anime’s ““long-term storytelling” and ““complex human relationships and worldview construction. ” Particularly in genres such as science fiction and fantasy, the ““taiga epic’’ structure of prog rock can work effectively as a musical device that complements the visual and narrative breadth. ■ Comparison between the golden age of progressive rock and Japanese animeIn the 1970s, progressive rock bands such as Pink Floyd and Yes produced albums with themes of ““space,” ““time,” and ““existence. ’’ Anime from the same period included ““Space Opera”-like works such as ““Space Battleship Yamato” (https://amzn. to/4pxqmcR) and ““Mobile Suit Gundam’’ (https://amzn. to/3IpgXmS). Although there is little direct contact between the two, it is interesting that they developed in parallel with their ““attitude to write stories from a cosmic perspective. ’’ ■ Case study: Evangelion and progressive rock feelIn fact, there are not many examples of progressive rock being directly introduced into anime. However, there are works that have been pointed out to have progressive rock elements. A typical example is  ”Neon Genesis Evangelion’’. The soundtrack by Shiro Sagisu is peppered with profound and dissonant developments reminiscent of King Crimson and Yes. In particular, songs such as ““Decisive Battle” and ““Thanatos” make frequent use of odd time signatures and key changes, and instead of giving the listener easy pleasure, they arouse anxiety and tension. This is exactly the expressive method that prog rock is good at, and it resonates with the ““difficulty” and ““philosophy” of the work as a whole. Additionally, the Western ideas and religious motifs that Eva pays homage to are also elements that frequently appear in progressive rock concept albums. As a result, it can be said that Evangelion embodies a progressive rock worldview not only visually and narratively, but also musically. ■ Why didn’t progressive rock become mainstream in anime?However, the mainstream of anime music is J-POP, rock, electro, etc. , and there are few examples of progressive rock being pushed to the forefront. One of the reasons for this may be the difference from commerciality. Progressive rock songs are often difficult to understand, long, and don”t have catchy hooks. It doesn”t go well with the ““short, impactful hook’’ required for openings and endings. However, on the other hand, there is still room for progressive rock techniques to continue to exist in ““places with a high degree of freedom’’ such as soundtracks, OVAs, and movie versions. Considering the rise of post-rock and progressive metal in recent years, the possibilities are even wider. ■ What if progressive rock had penetrated anime?Just imagine that.  Symphonic progressive rock that supports the fantasy world of Hayao Miyazaki’s works.  King Crimson-like cutting guitar riff that echoes through cyberpunk anime.  Think of long-term series works as albums, and design music with progressive rock suites for each season. The affinity between anime and progressive rock is not just a combination of musical genres and visual expressions, but has the potential to extend to the structural design of the entire story. ■ Representative progressive rock albums by generation and recommended tracks for anime fans      Year   Album / Recommended Tracks   Commentary         1970s   Pink Floyd “The Dark Side of the Moon” / “Time”   Songs with themes of space and existence resonate with the “Space Battleship Yamato” generation       1970s   Yes “Close to the Edge” / “And You and I”   The long composition is close to the epic development of Gundam       1980s   Marillion “Misplaced Childhood” / “Kayleigh”   The narrative album structure is highly compatible with OVA culture       1980s   King Crimson “Discipline” / “Frame by Frame”   The complex rhythm structure is reminiscent of the chaos of “AKIRA”       1990s   Dream Theater “Images and Words” / “Metropolis—Part I”   Technical and lyrical style that touches the Eva generation       1990s   Porcupine Tree “The Sky Moves Sideways” / “Stars Die”   Philosophical, introspective, Eva-like atmosphere       2000s   Tool “Lateralus” / “Lateralus”   The structure using the Fibonacci sequence has a “Ghost in the Shell” cybernetic feel       2000s   Sigur Rós “()” / “Untitled #8”   Post-rock development resonates with “Ergo Proxy”       2010s   Steven Wilson “Hand.

However, its long composition, difficult rhythm, and conceptual nature have a high affinity with the taiga-like development of anime works centered on science fiction and fantasy. Examples like Neon Genesis Evangelion, which directly incorporate progressive rock techniques, are just the tip of the iceberg. In the future, the delusion of ““what if anime was told through progressive rock’’ will continue to show new intersections between music and video.

    "body": "Function of jazz in animeText: mmr｜Theme: About the affinity between jazz/fusion and anime Jazz and fusion give anime an ““urban, adult-like atmosphere. ’’From fast-paced chase scenes to tranquil everyday scenes to humorous dialogues, his improvisation and sophistication synchronize a wide range of emotions with the images. ■ Representative success example: “Cowboy Bebop”Director Shinichiro Watanabe’s ““Cowboy Bebop,’’ which aired in 1998, is a monumental work that showed the world the affinity between anime and jazz. The music was composed by The Seatbelts, a band led by Yoko Kanno. Using everything from big band jazz to scat and fusion-like guitar solos, he depicted the story world of the anime as ““music itself. ’’ The opening song ““Tank!” had a big band sound reminiscent of a spy movie, but it also had an ““adult coolness” that was unusual for an anime opening song at the time, captivating fans all over the world. Since this success, jazz has often been referred to as a symbol of coolness and urbanity in anime. ■ Daily life anime and jazzOn the other hand, jazz is not just “urban”. Cafes, street corners on rainy days, calm afternoons - it is often used as background music to brighten up casual everyday life. For example, “Apollo on the Slope” (2012). The original manga uses jazz itself as its theme, but the sounds of the sessions that echo in the city of Nagasaki, where the story is set, support the fluctuations of daily life and youth with the improvisational nature unique to jazz. In addition, although ““Nodame Cantabile’’ focuses on classical music, swing and light jazz-style arrangements are inserted into everyday scenes, highlighting the free-spirited nature of the characters. ■ Scenes where jazz/fusion suits youFast-paced battles and chases → Complex fusion drums and bass lines double the rhythm of the video. Scenes of city nights and bars → The tones of the saxophone and piano create a ““adult atmosphere. ’’ Comical dialogue → Emphasize the tempo with light swing jazz. Quiet psychological depiction and lingering sound → The faint sounds of cool jazz and mode jazz are effective. ■ Correlation by age groupflowchart TDA1970[ 1970s: Lupine the Third  Yuji Ohno's Jazz Sound ]A198[ 1980s: City pop elements + jazz fusion permeate the soundtrack ]A199[ 1990s:  Cowboy Bebop  Yoko Kanno &amp; The Seatbelts ]A200[ 2000s:  Nodame Cantabile  Classical + Jazz Arrangement ]A201[ 2010s: Storytelling of jazz through the depiction of the  Apollo on the Slope  ]A202[ 2020s:  LAZARUS  (MAPPA x Shinichiro Watanabe x Kamasi Washington and others) ]A1970 --&gt; A198 --&gt; A199 --&gt; A200 --&gt; A201 --&gt; A202■ Jazz/fusion works recommended for anime fans      Year   Artist/Album   Recommended Tracks         1970s   Miles Davis Bitches Brew   “Pharaoh’s Dance”: A chaotic space battle scene       1980s   Miles Davis Tutu   “Tutu”: A character walking in the city at night       1990s   Katsumi Watanabe Tokyo Ensemble Lab   “Manhattan Flu Dance”: Bebop-like speed       2000s   Pat Metheny &amp; Charlie Haden Beyond the Missouri Sky   “Our Spanish Love Song”: A tranquil psychological depiction       2010s   Robert Glasper Experiment Black Radio   “Afro Blue”: Urban, contemporary daily life scene       2020s   Kamasi Washington Heaven and Earth   “Street Fighter Mas”: Matches action and science fiction worldview   ■ Fantasy crossover table (specific anime scenes x jazz songs)      Anime scene   Jazz/fusion song you want to play in your imagination   Explanation         Lupine the Third runs through the night city   Dave Brubeck “Take Five”   The lightness of the five-time signature emphasizes Lupine”s stylishness       Spike vs. Vicious (Cowboy Bebop final showdown)   John Coltrane “A Love Supreme”   Symbolizes sublime tension and a fateful battle       A scene from Makoto Shinkai’s work on a rainy day   Bill Evans “Waltz for Debby”   Transparent piano resonates with the beauty of the image       Session at Sakamichi no Apollon   Art Blakey “Moanin’”   The heat of the drums and horns amplifies the exhilaration of youth       Serious psychological warfare (Eva and Death Note)   Miles Davis “So What”   Cool mode jazz supports intellectual tension       LAZARUS: Final time limit battle scene   Kamasi Washington “Change of the Guard”   Grand, spiritual sound emphasizes the theme of human survival   ■ “LAZARUS” and the jazz spirit“LAZARUS”, which was broadcast in the spring of 2025, is a science fiction anime created by director Shinichiro Watanabe, MAPPA, and Kamasi Washington. Themes such as “death and rebirth,” “time limits,” and “salvation of humanity” resonate with the “improvisational reconstruction of life” that is inherent in jazz. In particular, Kamasi Washington’s spiritual jazz echoes the motif of ““Lazarus = resurrection’’ in multiple layers throughout the story. ■ SummaryJazz/fusion brings urbanity and improvisation to anime, and sometimes symbolizes the ““life and death” and ““destruction and rebirth” of the entire story. The stylishness of ““Lupin the Third”, the stylishness of ““Cowboy Bebop”, the youthful passion of ““Apollo on the Slope”, and the sci-fi scale of ““LAZARUS”──All of these are extensions of jazz’s ““free and regenerative spirit. ’’ And as the name “Lazarus” suggests, jazz is constantly revived in new forms and continues to be closely linked to the world of anime.

    "body": "History of American hip-hop: Overall picture including regions, clubs, media, equipment, etc. Text: mmr｜Theme: About hip-hop, where different styles have been formed in each region of the United States Hip-hop was born in the Bronx, New York in the late 1970s, and has developed into more than just a music genre, it has also become a culture linked to dance, graffiti, fashion, and social movements. In America, different styles were formed in each region, and development was supported by the club scene, radio, demo tapes, and record culture. Additionally, the development of sampling technology and the subsequent trend toward de-sampling symbolized musical innovation in hip-hop. Late 1970s: The origins of the Bronx and the foundations of club cultureRegion/era backgroundYoung people in the Bronx hold DJ parties in abandoned public spaces and community centers. By repeating broken beats, B-Boy/B-Girl dance evolved. Clubs and block parties were more than just music venues; they were a symbol of community unity. The importance of radio and demo tapesAt the time, hip-hop was popularized through radio programs (e. g. WBLS’s “The Show”), and demo tapes were an important means of discovering artists. DJ Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa played their mixtapes on local radio and at parties, helping to spread the word. Representative masterpieceThe Sugarhill Gang”Rapper’s Delight”(1979) Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five “The Message” (1982) Equipment/Sampling CultureIntroducing the Technics SL-1200 turntable, early MPC model, and drum machine (Roland TR-808). Sampling from records became central to music production, and DJs established a method of repeating the “break” parts of records. 1980s: East Coast Golden Age and West Coast RiseEast Coast (New York)Public Enemy and Eric B. &amp; Rakim appeared, and rap with political and social messages was born. The club also served as a place to try out new beats. West Coast (California)Gangsta rap develops. N. W. A. and Ice-T appear, depicting the street reality of Compton and Los Angeles. A unique G-funk style was honed in the clubs and rolling parties of the West Coast. Role of demo tapes and radioThe new song was aired on local radio stations (KDAY, KMEL), and young people who listened to the demo tape spread it by word of mouth. In particular, local radio DJs acted as referees of the scene. Representative masterpieceRun-D. M. C. “Raising Hell” (1986) Public Enemy “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back” (1988) N. W. A. “Straight Outta Compton” (1988) Sampling cultureExtract phrases from soul, funk, and jazz records using a sampler (Akai MPC60/SP-1200). Record culture was at the core of production, and DJs’ knowledge of records was directly linked to their technical ability. 1990s: East-West conflict, the rise of the South, clubs and record cultureEast Coast vs West CoastRegional tensions influence music, as exemplified by the conflict between The Notorious B. I. G. and 2Pac. New York clubs (Tunnel, Limelight) became places for rap battles and the premiere of new releases, fostering a rap battle culture. South (Atlanta, Houston, New Orleans)OutKast and UGK emerged and established their own unique sound. Tape distribution in clubs supported the spread of regional hip-hop. Movement towards desamplingDue to copyright issues and rising costs, an increasing number of artists are turning to original sound source production and live performance. Dr. Dre’s ““The Chronic’’ (1992) skillfully uses sampling, while G-funk uses a lot of synths and original bass lines. Representative masterpieceEast Coast: The Notorious B. I. G. “Ready to Die” (1994) West Coast: 2Pac “All Eyez on Me” (1996) South: OutKast”ATLiens”(1996) 2000s: Digitalization and diversification of the club sceneClub cultureDJ sets evolved at clubs in New York and LA. In an era before radio and streaming, songs became a buzz on club floors. Before demo tapes and the internet, rap battles were centered around clubs. De-sampling and equipment changesWith the spread of DAWs (Pro Tools, Ableton Live), it is now possible to create unique sound sources using synths and plug-ins without relying on sampling. This increases the proportion of original beats. Representative masterpieceJay-Z “The Blueprint” (2001) OutKast”Speakerboxxx/The Love Below”(2003) 2010s-Present: Streaming Era and GlobalizationCombining club and online cultureMainly released digitally on SoundCloud, YouTube, Spotify, etc. The club immediately changed its role as a place to see reactions. Battle Rap and Freestyle are distributed online and are appreciated beyond regional differences.

A. A. d city” (2012) Migos”Culture”(2017) Combined influence of region, club, media, and production methodsEast Coast: Breakbeat, social rap, record sampling culture West Coast: Gangsta rap, G-funk, rolling parties in the clubs Southern part: Trap, tape distribution, unique sense of rhythm Clubs and radio: A place for dissemination and dissemination, a hotbed of freestyle culture Sampling → De-sampling: Evolution to original production due to copyright issues and technological innovations Hip-hop is a culture that has evolved through a close intertwining of regions, clubs, media, and equipment, and is expected to continue to expand with new technology. Specific example of sampling copyright litigation   Grand Upright Music v. Biz Markie (1991)Gilbert O”Sullivan”s “Alone Again” unauthorized sampling lawsuit. Since then, it has been clarified that samples without permission are illegal.     Bridgeport Music v. Dimension Films (2005)An incident involving unauthorized use of Funkadelic’s guitar loop. It has become a legal precedent that the use of samples without permission, even for one second, is prohibited.     The Turtles v. De La Soul (1989~Settlement)Unauthorized sample in “Transmitting Live from Mars”. Since then, De La Soul has been difficult to distribute digitally for many years.  Role of mixtape culture Mixtapes by DJ Clue, DJ Drama, DJ Screw and others became a bridge from the underground to the mainstream in the 90s and beyond.  Southern (Houston, ATL) ““Screw Tape” and ““Gangsta Grillz” formed the scene, making it possible to discover artists independent of labels.  In the 2000s, Mixtape moved to “SoundCloud” and “DatPiff” and evolved into a means of promotion in the Internet era.

    "title": "[Column] Ambient: From \"listening music\" to \"feeling music\" II",
    "body": "From “music to listen to” to “music to feel” IIText: mmr｜Theme: Ambient, environmental music, electronic music culture theory Ambient is a genre of music that is not intended to be “actively listened to” by listeners, but rather to “exist in a space. ”He eliminates clear melodies and rhythms and instead uses sustained sounds (drones), environmental sounds (field recordings), and acoustic processing to construct auditory landscapes. This genre is extremely philosophical music that stands on the border between music and art, sound and space, perception and consciousness. ■ Before the 1960s: Ambient music as an ideaSocial backgroundAfter World War II, with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization, people’s living environments became acutely aware of the contrast between “noise” and “silence. ” Artists and composers began trying to rethink music as an “environment” rather than “entertainment. ” Representative trends Erik Satie: “Musique d”ameublement” positioned music not as something to be actively listened to, but as a “function” that constitutes a space.  John Cage《4”33”》(1952): A radical experiment in which the performer does not make any sound and uses the ambient sounds floating in the venue as music.  Musique Concrète: Pierre Schaeffer and others attempted to reconstruct sound by making full use of recording and editing techniques. Equipment/Technology Editing with tape recorder (cut up, reverse rotation, speed change) Field recording (city crowd, natural sounds) It was a conceptual precedent and later became the philosophical foundation of ambient music. ■ 1970s: Establishment of ambient musicSocial backgroundThe feeling of emptiness after the Vietnam War, the oil crisis, and the infiltration of 1970s New Age ideology. While commercial music has become more pop-oriented, there has also been a growing trend towards ““silence,” ““meditation,” and ““innerity. ’’ Masterpiece Brian Eno “Discreet Music” (1975) Brian Eno “Ambient 1: Music for Airports” (1978) Cluster &amp; Eno “Cluster &amp; Eno” (1977)Equipment/Technology Modular synths such as EMS VCS3 and ARP 2600 Sustained sound generation using tape loop echo Emphasis on processing and chanceFeaturesDuring this period, the word “ambient” took root, and the role of music as urban spatial art was established. It has attracted attention as music that can be adapted to airports, hospitals, and public spaces. ■ 1980s: Fusion with electronic musicSocial backgroundThe music is driven by the tension of the Cold War structure and at the same time by optimism towards technology. With the spread of home synthesizers, ambient music has shifted from being music for a minority of listeners to music that is part of everyday life.

Ambient music has expanded from “museum music” to “everyday relaxation. ” ■ 1990s: Encounter with club cultureSocial backgroundGlobalization and the explosion of techno/rave culture after the end of the Cold War. A ““chill-out space’’ was needed in between the mass-consuming four-on-the-floor beats.

It functions as music that supports the “behind the scenes” of club culture. The area where environmental sounds and beats intersect is explored. ■ 2000s: Digital age and cinematic expansionSocial backgroundThe unstable world situation after 9/11. Amid the stress of urbanization, themes such as ““meditation” and ““healing” are sought after. Digitalization has dramatically expanded sonic expression.

    "body": "Explore the cultural trajectory of “Initial D” as it accelerated Eurobeat and spread to the internet and street cultureText: mmr｜Theme: “After” Eurobeat spreads from Initial D Eurobeat’s “exit” and “return” ”Initial D” was a definitive work that strongly imprinted Eurobeat on Japanese youth, and at the same time was an ““outlet” for that music to be recirculated to the Internet generation. In the late 2000s, as Napster and YouTube became popular, anime clippings and fan-edited ““Eurobeat Drift Compilations” exploded in popularity. For young people in Europe and America, ““Initial D” became the ““entrance’’ to Eurobeat, and conversely, music imported from Japan returned to the world, creating a double cycle. From the mountain pass to simulation —— Riders in the digital spaceThe mountain pass depicted in “Initial D” is a real mountain pass in Gunma, but since the 2000s, Eurobeat has been connected to a gaming culture that can be called a “digital mountain pass. ”Eurobeat naturally flowed into arcade games such as ““Initial D Arcade Stage” and ““Wangan Midnight,” as well as the home game ““Gran Turismo’’ and online racing communities. The high-speed beat is not just background music that moves the car, but a catalyst that enhances the “virtual sense of acceleration” in the digital world. Acceleration of internet culture and memesFrom the late 2000s to the 2010s, Eurobeat was absorbed into Internet meme culture with songs like “Deja Vu” and “Running in the 90s. ”Amidst the trend of short-form videos, from YouTube Poop to MAD videos to TikTok, Eurobeat has transformed into a strange entity that is both a gag and a serious one. This sense of speed and humor coexist functions as a ““rhythm of laughter that can be understood intuitively’’ even for a generation that no longer knows Touge or anime. Inheritance of street culture and “running”On the other hand, Eurobeat continues to be “street music”. Eurobeat, which is played on the Shuto Expressway late at night, at drift events, and at tuning car meetings, has seeped into the real racing culture through Initial D. Here, it functions not just as background music, but as a symbol to share the ““spirituality of driving. ” In other words, music survives not only as a recreation of the mountain pass, but also as a ““community password. ” To the generation that inherits the “memory of acceleration”Today, many of the young people who click on the “Eurobeat – Initial D” playlist on Spotify or Apple Music have not necessarily run on mountain passes. But they’re accelerating in their headphones, drifting in virtual space, laughing on the internet and surrendering their bodies to the same sounds. Eurobeat has become a medium that transcends physical speed and updates the ““memory of acceleration’’ with each generation.

    "title": "[Column] Reggae music and cassette culture: the relationship between sound and material media spreading from Jamaica to the world",
    "body": "The connection between reggae and cassette cultureText: mmr｜Theme: Relationship between reggae and cassette culture based on the historical background Reggae music is a musical style that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s, and its rhythms and lyrics have been imbued with social and political messages. Its unique music distribution and enjoyment system centered on sound systems set it apart from the commercial record industry. The media called ““cassette tape’’ played an important role in this. Cassettes were cheap and easy to copy, and strongly connected local everyday life with reggae culture. Here, we will examine the relationship between reggae and cassette culture, taking into account the historical background. Late 1960s to 1970s — Birth of reggae and sound system culture   Establishment of ReggaeReggae was established around 1968 after ska and rock steady. Lyrics with heavier rhythms, an emphasis on the bass, and messages became popular. It was also during this period that artists such as Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Burning Spear became internationally known.     Role of sound systemIn Jamaica, it was difficult to own expensive record players and stereos, so huge sound systems, or groups of speakers installed on street corners, became the center of the musical experience. Producers and DJs independently played the latest 7-inch singles to appeal to the audience.     The advent of cassettesCompact cassettes, introduced in the early 1970s under the Philips standard, soon found their way into Jamaica. Although it was still in its early stages of popularity, local reggae fans and DJs began to pay attention to the potential of this small media.  1980s — Golden age of cassette culture and spread of reggae   Popularization of cassettesIn the 1980s, cassettes became the most popular music medium worldwide. Cheap and easy to carry, with the advent of playback devices such as radio-cassette players and Walkmans, it has become far more familiar than records.     Cassette recording in JamaicaAt sound system events and dance halls, a culture was born in which live recordings were recorded on cassettes and immediately distributed. Although this had some bootleg aspects, it became an important mechanism for packaging and disseminating the enthusiasm of the field. For example, recordings of specific sound system confrontations (sound clashes) and later distributing them on cassette were a valuable means of sharing experiences for fans.     Diaspora and CassetteFor Caribbean immigrant communities in Britain and the United States, the cassettes sent from Jamaica were a real-time medium that conveyed the ““current state of their homeland. ’’ Through the mail and informal networks, Jamaica’s latest reggae and dancehall music quickly spread overseas.  1990s — Dancehall, digitization, and the persistence of cassettes   Rise of digital reggaeAfter the debut of Sleng Teng in 1985, digital sound became mainstream and dancehall reggae spread around the world. With the mass production of riddims, the rise of MC culture, and the need for speedy distribution, cassettes continued to play an important role.     Cassettes and Local EconomyWhile official CD releases were in place, unofficial cassette sales flourished on the streets of Jamaica. Mixtapes, sold at markets and food stalls, were a way for ordinary people to obtain the latest sound sources at low prices, and a means of self-promotion for DJs.     Relationship with JapanJapanese reggae fans and DJs also visited Jamaica in the 1990s and collected local cassettes. These recordings were distributed at club events and record shops, and were directly linked to the development of reggae culture in Japan. Imported cassettes played an important role, especially in the Shibuya and Osaka scenes.  After the 2000s — Memories of the digital age and cassette culture   Rise of CD and MP3In the 2000s, CD-R and MP3 file sharing became mainstream, and cassettes gradually disappeared from the market. Music distribution via computers and the Internet has become established in Jamaica, and the role of the cassette as a physical medium has come to an end.     Reverberations of cassette cultureHowever, the characteristics of cassettes, such as immediacy, on-site enthusiasm, and informal distribution networks, have been inherited by the digital mixtape culture and live recording archives on YouTube. Additionally, amidst the global trend toward a return to analog, there is also a movement to reevaluate cassettes.     Rethinking cultural significanceMore than just a recording medium, the cassette symbolized reggae’s community-oriented nature, grassroots information distribution, and outlaw independence. Through cassettes, reggae took root as ““their music’’ for the masses.  Recommended cassette recording collection listA list of famous recordings that symbolize reggae cassette culture. These are not official records, but records that capture the excitement of the scene, and convey the atmosphere of the time most realistically.

History of cassette distribution in the Japanese reggae sceneThe cassette culture that originated in Jamaica has had a major influence on the Japanese reggae scene since the 1980s. Alongside imported records, locally recorded cassettes became an extremely important source of information for Japanese fans and DJs.    1980s: DawnAt record stores in Shibuya, Tokyo, and Minami, Osaka, sound system recording cassettes brought back from Jamaica were being traded on an underground basis. These were not genuine products, but copies of ““live recordings’’ made locally in Jamaica, and supported the earliest dancehall experiences in the Japanese club scene.     1990s: The heyday of imported cassettesIn the 1990s, when the number of Japanese reggae fans rapidly increased, local cassettes were indispensable as a way to learn about the latest riddim. It was brought home by travelers to Jamaica and sold at corners of record stores and event venues.

This led to the fusion of Japan’s unique reggae culture and styles imported directly from Jamaica.     After 2000s: CD-R and digitalization waveIn the 2000s, CD-R and MP3 became mainstream, and cassettes gradually disappeared. However, some collectors and DJs still preserve their cassettes and digitize them to give back to the scene. These continue to have value as a vivid archive of reggae’s reception in Japan.     Cultural SignificanceThe distribution of cassettes in the Japanese reggae scene was not just an “imported sound source” but a circuit for directly importing street music. Through cassettes, the Jamaican scene and Japanese clubs were connected, supporting the maturation of the local scene.

    "body": "Considering the relationship between major hard rock records and gaming cultureText: mmr｜Theme: Relationship between hard rock and gaming culture Hard rock was born from blues rock and psychedelic rock in the late 1960s and exploded in popularity in the 1970s. On the other hand, video game culture began to emerge in the late 1970s and became established as popular culture in the 1980s. Although both have developed independently, they have shared the impact of sound, visual aesthetics, and youth culture, creating unexpected intersections in each era. Here, we will organize the relationships by era and look back at the connections between representative masterpieces and gaming culture. 1960s-1970s: Birth of hard rock and the eve of arcades Background: Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath appear in London and Los Angeles. Presenting a new musical experience with explosive sounds and profound riffs.  Point of contact with games: This era was still in the early days of arcades (the eve of ““Pong” and ““Space Invaders”). Although the direct link is weak, the psychedelic artwork and experiments with electronic sounds create seeds that resonate with the game’s electronic music aesthetic.

    "title": "[Column] Hard rock and car culture: Another rock and roll played by the sound of an engine",
    "body": "Hard rock and outlaw lifestyleText: mmr｜Theme: The deep relationship between hard rock and car culture A column that explores the deep connection between hard rock and car culture. Explains the background behind the fusion of muscle cars, Harley-Davidsons, the outlaw lifestyle, and music. ■ Hard rock and outlaw lifestyleMore than just a music genre, hard rock has often been talked about as an inseparable ““way of life. ’’Symbols of this were the muscle cars and Harley-Davidsons, which were born from the background of American culture. The 1960s and 1970s were a tumultuous time for the United States, with the Vietnam War becoming a quagmire, the civil rights movement, and the clash between conservative values ​​and counterculture. Young people who rebelled against the existing order and social norms sought self-expression using the keyword “freedom,” and rock and motor culture were symbolic means for this. The roar of the large-displacement engine was as wild as the distortion emitted from a Marshall amplifier, and it shook the hearts of the listeners. Speed, power, and the freedom to deviate from the norm - these came together to form the “outlaw lifestyle. ” ■ “Easy Rider” and the atmosphere of the timesThe 1969 movie ““Easy Rider’’ is a symbol of the youth culture and hard rock lifestyle of the time. The protagonists” journey across America on motorcycles in search of freedom was not just a journey, but a metaphor for ““breaking away from the system. ’’ Steppenwolf”s “Born To Be Wild”, which plays on the soundtrack, resonates with the roar of motorcycles and is still passed down as a hard rock anthem of freedom. This film can be said to have defined the intimate relationship between hard rock and car culture by visualizing the moment when music, motorcycles, and freedom came together. ■ “Car” and “motorcycle” effects seen in AC/DC and KISSGlobal hard rock bands AC/DC and KISS have captivated audiences by incorporating car culture not only in their music but also in their performances.  AC/DC, as exemplified by songs such as ““Highway to Hell” and ““Thunderstruck,” overlaid images of ““road,” ““thunder,” and ““speeding’’ on rock music, directly linking music to the sensation of driving.  At KISS’ live performance, the sound of a Harley engine echoed with the flames in the background, giving the audience an experience as if the stage itself had been transformed into an American road movie. This echoed the 1970s American “culture of speed,” and hard rock strongly embraced cars and motorcycles as symbolic icons of popular culture. ■ Engine sound = another rock soundHard rock is supported by more than just explosive guitars and heavy drums. For fans, the sound of the engine itself was “another kind of rock”n”roll. ”  The roar of the V8 engine resonates with the guitar riff, giving the listener a sense of physical release.  The sound of an engine is ““uncontrolled noise,’’ and it overlaps with the rebellious spirit of rock, as it disrupts social order and silence. The roar of cars and motorcycles driving away was itself a musical experience, a ““rebellion through sound’’ against existing values. ■ Acceptance in Japan - Connection with Bosozoku cultureThis composition of ““hard rock x car/motorcycle culture’’ was uniquely developed in Japan as well. Bosozoku, which appeared in Japanese youth culture from the late 1970s to the 1980s, had a similar spirit to American outlaw culture in that they used domestically produced motorcycles rather than Harleys as their mainstay, but expressed themselves through engine sounds and noises. Many Japanese hard rock fans and heavy metal enthusiasts incorporated motorcycles and modified cars as part of their lifestyle, and the resonance between music and motor culture was certainly alive and well in Japanese society. This can be said to be the result of America”s longing for “freedom” being superimposed on Japan”s “delinquent culture. ” ■ Resonance between music and car cultureUnderstanding hard rock is more than just listening to albums. The existence of ““Harleys running down the road” and ““muscle cars cutting through the night” is essential, and the combination of their visuals and roaring sounds forms the overall cultural picture. When the roar of the engine and the guitar riff resonate, the music shakes not only the auditory senses but also the entire body, turning the audience into ““experiencers. ’’ This is where the core of hard rock, unlike any other genre, lies. ■ Recommended movie list (connection with music and motorcycle culture)      Release year   Title   Explanation         1969   Easy Rider   A counterculture film that symbolizes motorcycles and freedom. “Born To Be Wild” on the soundtrack.        1973   American Graffiti   A youth film depicting car culture.

On the other hand, in Europe and Japan, styles that emphasize lyricism and technique have developed, and hard rock continues to symbolize the ““outlaw spirit that changes with the times. ’’       Artist   Album   Release year   Features         Guns N” Roses   Use Your Illusion I &amp; II   1991   A masterpiece that combines hard rock and balladry       Metallica   Black Album   1991   “Enter Sandman” breaks the boundary between metal and rock       Foo Fighters   The Color and the Shape   1997   New generation rock anthem after grunge       Audioslave   Audioslave   2002   Rage x Soundgarden crossover       Velvet Revolver   Contraband   2004   Former GNR members’ return to classic rock after the 90s   Representative album list      Artist   Album   Release year   Features         Led Zeppelin   Led Zeppelin IV   1971   Includes “Stairway to Heaven”, Mythical Being       AC/DC   Back in Black   1980   Immortal hard rock anthem with worldwide sales       Deep Purple   Machine Head   1972   “Smoke on the Water” establishes a classic riff       Black Sabbath   Paranoid   1970   Dark and heavy sound symbolizes the outlaw spirit       Aerosmith   Toys in the Attic   1975   Rock and roll with a sexy and street feel   Hard rock and outlaw lifestyleHard rock is more than just a genre of music and is often referred to as a ““lifestyle. ’’ Symbolic of this are American muscle cars and Harley-Davidson. The roar of the large-displacement engine echoes through the city, resembling the distortion emitted by a guitar amp. As if music and machinery resonate at the same frequency, riders and drivers flaunt their presence. It also has deep ties to outlaw culture. Biker gangs and street culture in the ’70s often had hard rock as their soundtrack. The desire for freedom and deviation from the norm is an expression of strong, irresistible impulses, just like a hard rock guitar riff. Visually, leather jackets, denim, tattoos, and rugged motorcycles and cars embody a ““rebellious aesthetic. ’’From live music venues to highways, hard rock has always been inseparable from a way of life that involves explosive music, and that spirit continues to be passed down to this day. Japanese hard rock related songs and cultural backgroundHard rock in Japan gradually took root in the 1970s, and in the 1980s bands such as LOUDNESS and EARTHSHAKER made their way to the world. Also, from the 1990s onwards, groups such as X JAPAN, B’z, and GLAY developed their own interpretations of hard rock, which had a strong influence on the visual aspect. The culture of Harley-Davidson and American muscle cars has permeated the Japanese rock scene, and they are frequently used in live productions and music videos.

This trend continues from pioneers such as Aphex Twin and Autechre to the modern experimental electronic music scene. Early 1990s: Birth - The germ of “dance music for listening”At the end of the 1980s, in the midst of the UK rave culture and techno craze, underground labels and artists began to explore ““electronic music for home listening’’ rather than just a club tool.

Disco began as a subculture in the United States in the 1970s, and evolved independently in Japan by merging with nightlife culture. In the 1980s, it gave birth to ““Juliana Tokyo” and ““Maharaja” along with the bubble, and in the 90s it became integrated into club culture, and since the 2000s it has been reinterpreted in the context of Nu-Disco and city pop. Today, it continues to live on in Japan’s club/disco culture and continues to thrill dance floors across generations. "

    "body": "What is Tribal House?Text: mmr｜Theme: Tribal house that incorporates multi-layered percussion instruments such as African/Latin music (congas, bongos, etc. ) to house four-on-the-floor. Tribal House is a subgenre that combines the four-on-the-floor of house with multi-layered percussion instruments such as African/Latin music (congas, bongos, etc. ). It is characterized by an experiential structure that emphasizes percussion, and it developed with deep ties to club floor formats and DJ culture. Origin (1988-1994)Background of the timesIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chicago/New York club culture began to diverge and diversify from its disco-based house roots. One of its origins is when DJs dug up ethnic and Latin records from around the world and layered a “live percussion feel” on house music through record editing and sampling (this was the era when the long mix culture of clubs grew). Points of interest/site  In clubs in New York and Chicago in the early 1990s, DJ sets themselves were central to genre expression.  In the early days, live editing using records and turntables was the mainstream. Representative tools (at the time)  Turntable: Technics SL-1200 series (standard in the field).  Drum machines/samplers: Early samplers such as Roland’s TR series (TR-909/TR-808, etc. ) and Akai became the source of material for kicks and percussion (the history of the TR-909 can be found here here). Maturity and boom (1994-2000)Background of the timesIn the mid-90s, labels and compilations that pushed the boundaries of the genre appeared. In particular, TRIBAL America from the United States greatly contributed to the formation of the scene (Label information: Discogs — TRIBAL America). Representative works/people  Danny Tenaglia — Tourism (1998): An important album of club-oriented tribal expression.  Deep Dish — Junk Science (1998): Although it leans toward progressive rock, it is referred to as a work that connects to the club feeling of the 90s. Musical features  Enhance the floor experience with layered congas and percussion, combinations of sub-bass and powerful kicks, and long repeating compositions. Equipment/Production  The focus was on sampling with hardware (such as the Akai MPC) and layering of analog/digital drum machines (see Akai MPC — Wikipedia for the history of the Akai MPC family). Transformation and commercialization (2000s)Background of the timesIn the 2000s, tribal elements were fused with progressive/electro, etc. , and the number of derivative genres increased. The production environment has shifted from being hardware-based to DAW-based, making it possible to create more sophisticated sound designs. Change in production method  Processing of percussion instruments with extensive use of effect processing (filter/reverb/delay).  Popularization of “tribal feel that can be easily reproduced” using soft sample packs and plug-ins. Revival and Fusion (2010s-present)Background of the timesGlobalization and the rise of streaming have accelerated the fusion with Afro house and Latin rhythms. “Hybrid” production, which captures live percussion instruments in high resolution and processes them electronically, has become mainstream. Standard equipment on site (currently)  Software: Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Native Instruments (Maschine/Kontakt), etc.  Hardware: MPC series, Elektron equipment, Pioneer CDJ + DVS environment.  Sample: Utilize a library of high-quality ethnic percussion instruments. Masterpiece pick Danny Tenaglia — Tourism (1998) Deep Dish — Junk Science (1998) TRIBAL America related compilations/releases (one example): Discogs — TRIBAL AmericaEquipment chronology (simplified) 1980s~early 90s: Technics SL-1200 (turntable), Roland TR-909/TR-808 (drum machine), early Akai/E-mu samplers. References: Technics SL-1200, Roland TR-909, Akai.  mid 90s-2000s: Heavy use of Akai MPC series and hardware samplers (Reverb — A Brief History of the Akai MPC).  2010s~Present: Hybrid operation of DAW (Ableton/Logic), software samples such as Kontakt and Maschine, and MPC.

Strictly Rhythm (commonly known as Strictly) is a house specialty label founded in New York in 1989. With their A&amp;R sense honed on the street and their club-oriented song selection, they led the 90’s house scene in New York and around the world. The label excelled at discovering and nurturing DJs/producers while striking a balance between underground “sounds” and commercial hits. 1989-1992: Birth and “NY Local Experiment Station” periodHistorical background: House/techno, which had sprouted in Chicago and Detroit, entered New York clubs in the early 1990s. It was a time when club culture was about to become commercialized, and an underground spirit of experimentation remained. What happened: Founded in 1989 by Mark Finkelstein and Gladys Pizarro. Since our founding, we have focused on DJ-oriented 12-inch music, producing sound that connects directly to the dance floor and is popular at local clubs.

    "body": "History and masterpieces of Experimental MusicText: mmr｜Theme: Changes in experimental music from the avant-garde to the post-digital era “Experimental music” was born as an attempt to deviate from traditional harmonies and forms and explore the possibilities of sound itself. It began with the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century, which transcended the framework of classical music, and continues to expand to include electronic acoustics, industrial, noise, and modern digital music.

Text: mmr   Theme: Genre: Music column   Theme: Comparative analysis of 90’s Euro music by country of production   Although it is often referred to as ““Euro music,” in reality, the ““sound texture” and ““aesthetic sense’’ differ depending on the country in which it was produced. In the 1990s, the main battlegrounds for this genre were Italy, Germany, and Sweden. Based on their respective cultural, industrial, and technological backgrounds, they were exporting their own ““sound of the euro’’ to the world.

Even though they are all similar, the heat of Italy, the hardness of Germany, and the coolness of Sweden are clearly different. Music born at the intersection of global and local. That may be the essence of the 1990s euro. "

    "body": "Noise = Aesthetics: Converting sounds that are considered harsh to the ear into “pleasure” and “art”.       Text: mmr   Theme: Rebellion and destruction - a challenge to existing music and social order.    “Noise” is not simply “noise,” but refers to a field of expression that deviates from established musical idioms (melody, harmony, rhythm) and emphasizes the sound itself, texture, physical impact, and auditory stimulation. Born from a combination of artistic, technological, and social backgrounds, it has continued to change shape for over 100 years. 1) Pioneer (1910s–1940s): Futurism and tape experiments — conceptualization of “noise”Historical backgroundA time when industrialization and urbanization made the noise of the city crowds and machinery commonplace. The ““aesthetic sense’’ of sound expanded, and sounds other than traditional musical instruments began to be incorporated into art. Important events/people In 1913, Italian avant-garde artist Luigi Russolo published ““The Art of Noises’’. Representative works Live recording of Russolo’s “Noise Machine”. Equipment/Technology Demonstrations using mechanical and environmental sounds. 2) Tape and concrete (1940s–1960s): Formation of the technological foundationHistorical backgroundAfter World War II, the development of magnetic tape and electroacoustic equipment made it possible to compose music using “recordings themselves” as material (musique concrète). Important events/people musique concrète (1948-) by Pierre Schaeffer. Representative works Works by Pierre Henry and Tod Dockstader. Equipment/Technology Tape editing (reverse rotation, looping, cutting/splicing). 3) Deviation from rock and proto-noise (1960s–1970s)Historical backgroundRock becomes more experimental and noise is incorporated into the rock context. Representative works Lou Reed “Metal Machine Music” (1975)Equipment/Technology Guitar feedback, effectors, and simple recorders. 4) Industrial and early noise scene (late 1970s – 1980s)Historical backgroundAn independent noise scene was born out of a backlash against commercial music. Important events/people Throbbing Gristle establishes the “industrial” concept. Representative works Early releases of Kollaps (Einstürzende Neubauten), Throbbing Gristle. Equipment/Technology Industrial percussion instruments, metal sounds, simple synthesizers. 5) Power electronics and Japanese noise (1980s)Historical backgroundCassette culture and the DIY spirit formed an international noise network. Important events/people Whitehouse (UK), Merzbow (Japan)Representative works Merzbow”s “Pulse Demon” related works, Whitehouse”s early edition. Equipment/Technology Destructive amplifiers, radio noise, distortion pedals, and cassette recordings. 6) Diversification and crossover (1990s–2000s)Historical backgroundNoise intersects with rock, metal, post-rock, and electronica. Representative works/trends Boredoms, Lightning Bolt, Sonic Youth, etc. Equipment/Technology DAW, digital effects, samplers, granular synthesis. 7) Modern (2010s–present): Software and ModulesHistorical backgroundDiversification through modular synth revival and laptop acoustics. Representative trends Connection with Eurorack noise, live coding and sound art. Equipment/Technology Modular (Eurorack), Max/MSP, SuperCollider, Circuit Bending. Summary of equipment changes Initial: Noise machine, environmental sound Tape period: Magnetic tape editing Analog period: Synth, guitar + effects Cassette period: DIY noise, cassette distribution Digital period: DAW, software processing Modern: Eurorack, live coding, circuit bendingRepresentative masterpiece list Luigi Russolo — The Art of Noises (1913, theory/performance) Pierre Schaeffer — musique concrète works Lou Reed — Metal Machine Music (1975) Throbbing Gristle — early works Einstürzende Neubauten — Kollaps Merzbow — Pulse Demon and others Whitehouse — early works Boredoms — Late experimental works Lightning Bolt — Early 2000s workAt the endNoise music is always a challenge to existing aesthetics and an attempt to expand the boundaries of music. From Russolo’s mechanical sounds to modular synths, even after more than 100 years of history, the essence of all instruments is to “listen to the sound itself. ” "

Starting from his A-100 system, by standardizing module sizes and power supply standards, a system was born that allowed modules from different manufacturers to be freely combined. Smaller and more affordable than the traditional Moog and Bucla, Eurorack has gained the support of many musicians and enthusiasts, and has now developed into a large ecosystem with over 300 manufacturers participating around the world.

    "body": "“The sound of the future born from a devastated city”      Text: mmr   Theme: Detroit Techno is a cultural product that combines urban history, technology, and Black American creativity.    Detroit techno is ““electronic music with a human touch’’ that was born from the intersection of urban industrial sounds, black American dance culture, and European electronic music. In this column, we will comprehensively introduce the history of its origin, the characteristics of its sound, its main characters and representative songs, its social background, its spread around the world, and its influence to this day. Origins and Definition — When and Who Called it “Techno”?In Detroit in the early 1980s, electronic dance music that made full use of synths and rhythm machines grew. Led by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (not the so-called “Berlin trio” but the “Detroit trio”), they presented a sonic aesthetic that was different from the existing “electro” and “house,” and it became established as “techno. ” The release of the 1988 compilation “Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit” (https://amzn. to/4q9NMVF) played a decisive role in the spread of the genre name. Cultural and social background — the shadow of the industrial city of DetroitDetroit is a city known for its automobile industry. The sounds of factory machinery, stories of retreat and unemployment, and urban devastation and rebirth deeply influenced the texture and emotion of the music that grew there. On the other hand, African American radio DJ culture (e. g. curators like Electrifying Mojo) and club culture mixed with European electronic music (especially Kraftwerk) to create a unique direction (the influence of Kraftwerk and others is often pointed out). Sound characteristics — mechanical but warm   Built around drum machines (TR-808/909) and synths (Roland type, analog).     Layer melodic/textural synth work on simple repetitive rhythms.     Detroit style is colder and more mechanical than house, but has ““melody and emotion. ’’  The line between DJ and producer was blurred, and the songs were refined through playing practice (mixing/reacting) in clubs. Main characters and “signature songs”Juan Atkins / Cybotron / Model 500“Clear” (1983) under the name Cybotron is one of the important songs of early electro-techno, and is characterized by a mechanical groove and a sense of space with synths.  ”No UFOs’’ (1985) under the name Model 500 was released on the Metroplex label and is renowned as a techno classic. Derrick May / Rhythim Is Rhythim“Strings of Life” (1987) is an anthem that shook the club with its emotional piano phrase-like synth and driving rhythm. It’s a song that is influential in both techno and house. Kevin Saunderson / Inner CityKevin developed a pop-oriented approach to club techno, and Inner City’s “Big Fun” and “Good Life” (1988) became worldwide hits and commercial success stories for Detroit music. Jeff Mills / The BellsOne of Jeff Mills’ masterpieces, ““The Bells,’’ has sold over 500,000 copies worldwide, even though it was released as an analog record, and has become an iconic track in the history of techno. Other (Scene Expansion)Diverse generations followed, including Richie Hawtin (a second generation whose later work bridged the gap between Detroit and the international scene). Role of important labels and releasesLocal indie labels such as Metroplex (Juan Atkins) and Transmat (Derrick May, *Transmat was founded in the mid-1980s) gave creators direct freedom and became bases for exporting to the world. Singles from these labels grew in clubs and eventually became international through albums and compilations. *(We recommend checking the detailed establishment information and release year for each work. ) Worldwide transmission — to and from Berlin/EuropeDetroit techno combined with Berlin rave and club culture in the 1990s to create new expressions, and conversely, clubs from Europe (particularly Germany) invited Detroit artists, leading to mutual development. The 1988 compilation ““Techno!” became the catalyst that established the term ““techno” in the European market. Impact — Beyond MusicFashion: Workwear, utility, and minimal/functional aesthetics influence club wear. Visual/Art: Artwork that uses industrial textures and contrasts between neon and steel is on the rise. Technological perspective: The democratization of music production equipment (second-hand distribution of equipment, cheap synths) has supported the idea that “anyone can produce music. ” Modern Detroit Techno — Inheritance and ReinterpretationEven into the 21st century, Detroit continues to be talked about as the “sacred place” for techno. While the artists of yesteryear continue to play in the field, a younger generation is remixing and reinterpreting the spirit of the classics, making it sound in new clubs and festivals. There is also a movement where music is linked to urban social issues and the context of recovery, and music is used as a means of community revitalization. Highlights/Introductory list (must listen tracks)The following are the “core” songs for understanding Detroit techno.    “Clear” — Cybotron — 1983     “No UFOs” — Model 500 (Juan Atkins) — 1985     “Strings of Life” — Rhythim Is Rhythim (Derrick May) — 1987     “Big Fun” “Good Life” — Inner City (Kevin Saunderson) — 1988     Compilation: “Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit” — 1988  Production technical notesTypical equipment: Roland TR-808/909 (rhythm), SH-101, Juno series, sequencer (hard/soft). Construction method: Add “movement” to the repeating beats by changing filters and effects, and design spaces. It’s common to use EQ to keep the lows thick and the highs clear. Mastering: Since it is intended for club playback, be careful of low-end dropout and phase. Take advantage of the characteristics of both analog and digital. From Detroit to the World - The Eternal Poetry of ElectronicsDetroit techno is more than just dance music; it”s a cultural product that combines the city”s history, technology, and Black American creativity. Rather, the repetition of mechanical rhythms evokes human emotions and community - this is Detroit’s “warm mechanical sound. ” By listening to famous songs from the past and experiencing the spirit at the venue (DJ set or festival), you will be able to appreciate the depth of this music even more.

    "title": "[Column] History and evolution of DTM (DAW) — How the sound production environment has changed from home to professional",
    "body": "“An environment where everyone can deliver sound to the world”Text: mmr｜Theme: A cultural device symbolizing the “democratization of music production” DTM (DeskTop Music) - Called ““DTM’’ in Japanese and DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) in English-speaking countries, the workflow refers to a culture in which recording, editing, mixing, and production are completed using computers and software. In this article, we will organize the flow from its emergence to the present, along with a chronology, with a focus on “technological turning points” and “cultural impact. ” Trend by era1940–1960s: Era of tape and multitrack recordingTechniques for “cutting and pasting” sound developed, such as tape editing, tape looping, and musique concrète. Overdub recording in studios became popular. 1970s: Synthesizers and early computer musicInstruments such as analog synths and the Minimoog spread, and electronic music production methods diversify. Around 1983: The appearance of the MIDI standard (standardized data communication between musical instruments) → revolutionized the production workflow. Late 1980s – Early 1990s: Early digital editing/sequencer + hardware eraIntroducing samplers, hardware sequencers, and early computer-based music software. The advent of professional digital recording systems. Mid-Late 1990s: Professionalization of Pro Tools and digital recordingHigh-performance recording systems that rely on hardware have become widespread, and post-production and recording are rapidly becoming digital. Plug-in standards such as VST have also been established. 2000s: Computer-based DAWs became mainstream and home studios exploded. Lower prices and improved plug-in quality have made it possible for individuals to create professional-quality products. Loop culture, combined with the expansion of online distribution. 2010s: DAW diversification and live/improvisation-oriented (Ableton, etc. )Introducing non-linear editing, clip-based live music integration, cloud and collaboration tools. 2020s: AI-assisted production, cloud collaboration, further democratizationAutomatic mixing/mastering, generation AI, cloud project sharing, etc. are affecting the production flow. Origin and early days (tape to analog era)The origin of DTM is the act itself of ““creating a work by recording and editing sound. ’’ Experiments with physical media, such as tape editing (cutting and pasting), tape looping (creating repeated sounds), tape reversing, and speed manipulation, shaped electronic music in the mid-20th century. This was an era where large studio equipment and skilled engineers were the focus. Revolution brought about by the advent of MIDI (around 1983)MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a standard for exchanging note information and control information between keyboards, sequencers, and computers. This made production by integrating synthesizers and external modules much easier, and made software sequence control (later the core of DAWs) a reality. MIDI standardizes “performance information” and dramatically increases the flexibility of music production. The Rise of Computers and Software (1990s)Improvements in computer performance and the practical use of hard disk recording have made it possible to edit audio waveforms digitally. Avid”s Pro Tools (then Digidesign) digitally enabled professional recording and editing workflows and became the industry standard for film, broadcast, and music production. At the same time, software sequencers/comprehensive DAWs such as Steinberg”s Cubase and Emagic’s Logic (later acquired by Apple) became popular. Furthermore, the VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plug-in proposed by Steinberg expanded the ecosystem by providing a mechanism for third parties to develop software sound sources and effects. Birth of home studios and “individual production” (2000s)With improvements in the performance of personal PCs, the spread of audio interfaces, and improvements in the quality of plug-ins, recording is no longer just for the studio. Production environments centered around loops and patterns, such as FL Studio and Ableton Live, have changed the production style of electronic music and hip-hop, and it has become common for individuals to complete albums and soundtracks at home. With the combination of Internet distribution and sales platforms (Bandcamp, SoundCloud, etc. ), the threshold from production to release has dropped dramatically. 2010s and beyond: Diversification, improvisation, and cloud computingDAWs have evolved from tools for simply “recording, arranging, and mixing” to multifunctional features such as live performance (Ableton Live), real-time collaboration, video linkage, and modular integration. Usage options are further expanding, including mobile apps/DAWs for iPad, cloud project synchronization, and the introduction of subscription models. Technical key elements (what supports the DAW)Audio interface: The quality of AD/DA conversion and low latency (delay) determine the comfort of production. MIDI: Recording/editing performance information. We will also keep an eye on the evolution of standards such as MIDI CC and MIDI 2. 0 (which is gradually becoming popular). Plug-ins (VST/AU/AAX, etc. ): Expand functionality by adding soft sound sources and effects. Sampling and Samplers: An important tool in sound design. Sampler culture is the foundation of hip-hop and electronica. Time stretch/pitch correction: Freely manipulate the length and pitch of sounds (e. g. audio quantization, pitch correction tools). Automation and Modulation: Achieve dynamism by changing parameters over time. Non-destructive editing: Can be edited without changing the original data. Basic functions of DAW. Features of major DAWsPro Tools (Avid): Industry standard for professional recording and post-production. Its strength is its robust editing and mixing. AAX plugin. Cubase (Steinberg): Strengths in MIDI sequences and composition workflow. The creator of the VST standard. Logic Pro (Apple): Comprehensive and cost-effective. Popular with Mac users. Abundant built-in sound sources. Ableton Live: Specialized in clip-based improvisation and live use. Widely used in electronic systems. FL Studio: Ideal for creating loops/patterns, popular for beat making. Easy to use piano roll. REAPER: Lightweight and highly customizable. Low cost and plenty of community expansion. Changes in cultural aspects and industrial structureDemocratization: Lower production costs have made it possible for a variety of artists to participate. Indie/home production has become the norm. Collaboration: International collaboration and file exchange via the internet is expanding. Boundaries are solved. Changes in commercial models: Direct sales through self-produced products, software usage through subscriptions, and expansion of the plug-in market. Learning and Community: The democratization of learning is progressing through know-how sharing on YouTube and forums. Current trends and near futureIntroduction of AI: AI tools are beginning to take over some of the work, such as songwriting assistance, mix correction, and mastering automation. There is a possibility that the role of tools will shift from “assistance” to “co-creator. ” Cloud/Collaboration: Online synchronization and real-time collaborative editing of DAW projects is increasing. **Modular integration/hybrid workflow: **Fusion of software and hardware (outboard, modular). While hardware equipment is being reproduced with software, there is also a strong movement to seek the presence of hardware. Live and Interactive: The application of DAWs is expanding not only to music but also to multimedia and interactive experience creation. Practical advice (for those who are about to start DTM)Clarify your purpose (track production, band recording, live performance, sound design, etc. ). The choice of DAW is determined by the purpose. The basics are a sense of sound creation and arrangement. Musical trial and error and ear training are more important than expensive equipment. Plugins are tools. After understanding the basics of EQ, compression, and reverb, move on to special effects. Solidify your workflow. Get into the habit of using templates and shortcuts to save time. Backup and version control. Save projects frequently and use cloud synchronization. Mini dictionary of termsDAW: Digital Audio Workstation. Software for recording, editing, mixing, and producing audio. MIDI: Digital standard for representing performance information (notes, velocity, controls). VST/AU/AAX: Plug-in standards (third-party sound sources/effects). Audio interface: A device that connects a PC to a microphone/instrument (performs AD/DA conversion). Sampling: A technique that uses existing sound sources as materials. What is DTM? — Co-evolution of technology and cultureDTM/DAW is not just a collection of tools, but a cultural device that symbolizes the ““democratization of music production. ’’ From the days of tape editing and hardware synths, to MIDI and digital recording, to VST and plug-in ecosystems, to AI and the cloud, technology has lowered the barriers to expression and created an environment where anyone can deliver sound to the world. Technology will continue to evolve, but at the core is the creator’s intention: ““What kind of sound should we make and why?’’ By fully utilizing technology as a tool, new musical expressions will continue to be born.

    "title": "[Column] Happy Hardcore and Japanese Culture: The Encounter of High-Speed ​​Beat and \"Kawaii\"",
    "body": "“Musical characteristics and Japanese sensibilities”Text: mmr｜Theme: The relationship between Happy Hardcore and Japanese culture Happy Hardcore emerged from the British rave scene in the early 1990s. The music, which combines pop and emotional melodies with explosively fast beats of around 170 BPM, took Europe by storm, and then unexpectedly connected with Japanese culture, achieving a unique development. The affinity between this “happy” sound and “Japanese culture” is not just an import of musical genres, but a new cultural hybrid. What is Happy Hardcore?Derived from British rave/hardcore techno in the early 1990s. Characteristics: High tempo of around 170BPM, pop and melodic synth, anime/cartoon sampling. As the name suggests, this genre is a combination of “Happy” and “Hardcore”. Relevance to Japanese cultureAffinity with anime/game musicHappy Hardcore emphasizes bright and catchy melodies, so it goes well with the taste of anime songs and game music. In particular, the use of voice material from bishoujo anime and Famicom/SNES-style chiptunes are popular with overseas producers. Example: In the Anime Rave/J-Core scene, anime lines and melodies are sampled to make it happy hardcore. Connection with J-CoreSince the 2000s, Japan’s unique “J-Core” scene has emerged. Based on happy hardcore, fused with otaku culture (anime, doujin, Akihabara club culture). DJ Sharpnel and m1dy are internationally known. Overseas fans recognize the formula of “Happy Hardcore + Anime” as “Japanese” and support it as a re-import. Dance game culture (BEMANI/DDR)Many happy hardcore songs are included in Konami’s Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and beatmania IIDX series. As a result, game center culture other than clubs in Japan has spread to young people. For example: DDR songs by Naoki, Ryu☆, DJ Shimamura and others have a great influence on Happy Hardcore fans overseas. Festivals and doujin salesUnlike rave in the UK, the scene in Japan is centered around M3 (sound/media mix doujin sales) and Akihabara-style club events. “Derivative music distribution” and “doujin CD culture” uniquely supported the distribution and development of Happy Hardcore. Cultural keywords   Kawaii: Japanese “kawaii culture” is reflected in the fast, pop melody.     Otaku culture: Directly connected to anime, doujinshi, and Akihabara club culture.     Game culture: DDR and music games made happy hardcore more familiar.     Reimportation phenomenon: A genre that originated in the UK develops independently in Japan and once again influences the world.  Representative Japanese happy hardcore/J-Core artists   DJ Shimamura – Representative of Japanese happy hardcore.     DJ Sharpnel – Highly praised as “J-Core” overseas.     Ryu☆ / kors k – Main creator of BEMANI scene.     P＊Light / REDALiCE – Popular producer of Akihabara club culture.  The unique role of Japanese culture in global music historyHappy Hardcore originally came from British rave, but it merged with Japanese culture (anime, games, doujins, music games) to form a unique “J-Core” culture. Today, it is recognized as being associated with “Happy Hardcore = anime-like cuteness,” and Japan has become an important base internationally. "

    "title": "[Column] Interaction history of music culture and \"outlaws\" by generation",
    "body": "“Music comes from the margins of society”Text: mmr｜Theme: Long-read column that connects subculture research and the temperature of the field “Music comes from the margins of society. ” This phrase is old, but it doesn’t miss the point. The sense of urgency, anti-normativity, and communal passion that comes from marginality is often visualized as an “outlaw,” and crystallizes in the form of sound, use of space, fashion, and body techniques. In this article, we trace the major genres/scenes from the 1950s onwards by age, and look at the intersection of “music and outlaws” through the lens of sociology and cultural studies (Hebdidge, Cohen, Beaudrieu, Becker, etc. ). 1950s: Bebop ~ Rockabilly – Aesthetics of the periphery and manners of “non-conformity”The late modernization of jazz (bebop to hard bop) was associated with late-night clubs, drugs, and the black bohemian lifestyle, forming an image of an intellectual outlaw that deviated from postwar norms centered on “work and discipline. ” Rock and roll/rockabilly is a cross-border fusion of white working-class youth culture and black music. Leather jackets, pompadours, and hot rods became “anti-authority” costumes, and the icons of greasers and bikers were established. Mechanism: Mixing of music that crosses racial and class boundaries + nighttime entertainment = inducing “moral panics” (Folk devils and moral panics: Stanley Cohen). Regulations by the police, schools, and religious groups actually strengthen the unity of the scene. 1960s: Mods vs. Rockers, Hippies, and Garage: Style Struggles and CountercultureBritish mods include tailored suits, scooters, and a taste for soul/R&amp;B. Rockers are leather jackets and cafe racers. Group clashes at seaside resorts have become a symbol of the delinquency of young people. Psychedelic/hippie protests, resistance to conscription, drug consciousness expansion, and commune living. Music festivals (Monterey, Woodstock) become testing grounds for autonomous spaces. Garage/protopunk is a DIY spirit and anti-commercialism. School gymnasiums and warehouses have been turned into live music venues. Mechanism: A battle over fashion differentiation—what Hebdidge called “style appropriation. ” The media exaggerates violence and amplifies moral panic. 1970s: Punk, reggae, disco: fight and flight born of urban crisisPunk (NY/UK) builds anti-establishment slogans and minimal capital infrastructure (indie labels, zines, squat venues) against a backdrop of unemployment, devastation, and racial friction. Pit, spikes, and DIY safety pins are visual symbols of “illegal threading. ” Reggae/dub is associated with sound system culture and is responsible for the self-defense and pride of immigrant communities. Tensions with police are frequent, and the lyrics speak of resistance to systemic racism. Disco is a haven for the LGBTQ+/Black/Latinx community, gaining the right to dance on the border between legal and illegal, even though it has its dark sides such as nightclub security and admission discrimination. Mechanism: Hollowing out of cities and strengthening of management of public spaces → People on the periphery evacuate underground at night. Sound pressure and physical contact form solidarity. 1980s: Hardcore, skinhead reformation, and the birth of hip-hop – speed, tribalization, and the weaponization of narrativeHardcore punk is about speed, short lengths, and floor autonomy (circle pits, stage dives) created by instantaneous “agreement. ” On the other hand, there are conflicts with violence and xenophobia. Skinhead/Oi! is a connection between working-class pride and music, but there is a political bifurcation to the left and right. Anti-racist movements (such as SHARP) are also running in parallel. Hip-hop has the “four pillars” of block parties, graffiti, breaking, and DJ/MC. Many neighborhoods are surrounded by gang violence, and rap functions as a legal “weapon” to express the city’s reality and self-narration. Metal has been given the image of being “demonized” and has aroused controversy over self-regulation such as the PMRC. Depending on the subgenre, it can also create social conflicts over violent incidents and discriminatory statements. Mechanism: “Tribalization” (mafezori) of subcultures. Small norms are powerful, and from the outside it looks like an “outlaw. ” 1990s: Rave/Acid House, Grunge, Gangsta Rap - Negotiating the boundaries between legal and illegalRave/acid house is at loggerheads with the authorities over illegal parties in warehouses and outdoors, as well as drug issues. The dawn of mobile phones and Internet bulletin boards accelerated the “mobile party. ” Although grunge/alternative music advocated an anti-commercial stance, it quickly became mainstream, exposing the classic pattern of anti-authority symbols being recycled for consumption. Gangsta rap’s explicit portrayal of police violence, social inequality, and street norms made it a target for the media. The debate over the imitability of real violence and expression has become a social issue. Mechanism: A cat-and-mouse game between laws and regulations (related to noise, gatherings, entertainment businesses) and creative avoidance (secret locations, free parties). 2000s: P2P era, DIY re-expansion and “cyber outlaws”File sharing/mixtape culture is in direct conflict with the copyright regime. With the spread of underground net labels and home studios, the line between “illegal and legal” has become blurred. EMO/Screamo and Nu Metal’s self-revelation and expressions of anger create tension with home and school norms. Mechanism: Lower prices of hardware and democratization of software → decentralization of production and distribution. Platform rules will become the new “public safety. ” 2010s: Trap, SoundCloud Rap, and Leftfield Club: Fragile Economy and Self-BrandingTrap aestheticizes representations connected to the realities of economic periphery (drug economy, surveillance society) through the deep bass and repetition of the 808. SoundCloud rap aestheticizes drug addiction and mental fragility, and combines self-destructive impulses with pop sensibilities. Leftfield/Queer Clubs are rebuilding safe night spaces and establishing internal “rules” to counter discrimination (no harassment, no photography, etc. ). Mechanism: SNS makes reputation capital visible. Gaining visibility provokes the abuse of “outlaw symbols,” while community norms are autonomously reinforced. 2020s: Irregular spaces after the pandemic: Micro-rave and local communitiesDuring the lockdown period, guerrilla-style outdoor DJ/streaming occurred all over the world. Attempts have been made to “reoccupy public spaces” such as parks, rooftops, and streets, and negotiations with police and residents have entered a new stage. The hybridization of social movements and music events (fundraising parties, mutual aid community kitchens, etc. ) is progressing, and the focus is on care and consensus-building rather than the “illegal/legal” dichotomy. Correlation by regionUnited States: The cultural capital of the black community (gospel, blues, hip-hop) is at the core of outlaw representation. Gun control, drug policy, and police practice directly hit the lyrics and the scene. Britain/Europe: Collective nature intertwined with class, immigration, and football culture. Rave culture tends to clash with urban planning and private land systems. Japan: From the early acceptance of rockabilly/punk to the “underground box” of hardcore and the dawn of clubs, conflicts with administrative regulations (late-night business/entertainment-related) are commonplace. The importation and localization of sounds and the self-management of venues have developed. 7 circuits that create “outlaw status”Conversion of space: Warehouse/ruins/street → club/venue (problems with illegal construction, noise, and occupation). Economic periphery: Friction between informal distribution (booting, mixing, hand selling) and the copyright regime. Physical Techniques: Movements that appear violent/obscene to the outside, such as moshing, breaking, and wind-ups. Style differentiation: Clothes, hair, and tattoos are read as “symbols of hostility” (Hebdidge). Radicalization of the narrative: The realism/exaggeration of the lyrics is misinterpreted by the media as a crime warning. Media Apparatus: Reporting creates a “popular devil” (Cohen’s Moral Panic). Reflection with the system: The cycle of crackdown → underground → strengthening of solidarity → commercial recovery → deviation again. The light and shadow of the outlaw: ethics and dangerPositive aspects: Opportunities for expression, solidarity, and self-efficacy for people excluded from existing systems. Reimagining public space. Negative aspects: Reproduction of violence, discrimination, and gender inequality, drug and health damage, and actual harm to the neighborhood. Today’s issues: Creating a safe space (safe space policy), consensus building, dialogue with the local community, archiving and inheritance. Reference   Dick Hebdidge “Subculture: The Meaning of Style”     Stanley Cohen “Folk Devils and Moral Panics”     Howard Becker “The Outsiders”—What is labeling theory?     Pierre Bourdieu “Distancion”—Critique of social judgment     Michel Maffezzoli “The Transformation of the Political”—A Tribalized/Smallized World  Who draws the boundaries?The relationship between music and outlaws is not a glorification of crime. Rather, it is a visualization of the power dynamics of ““who, what, and how to call deviance’’ and at the same time a story of the creativity of the periphery. From rockabilly in the 1950s to micro-rave in the 2020s, music has teased the edges of norms, loosening social rigidities and experimenting with new public sensibilities. Their outlaw nature is dangerous, but the beats that spark from that spark often shape the next mainstream movement - all the time. "

What is German techno?“German Techno” rose rapidly from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, and continues to have a major influence on the world club scene. Cities such as Berlin and Frankfurt in particular are known as symbolic hubs for the development of techno, creating their own unique aesthetics through club culture and label activities. Historical background: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the explosion of technoThe fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was a turning point in the development of techno in Germany.

Sound Features:    Hard minimal/industrial style becomes mainstream     Fusion with groove-oriented techno house (Tech House)     Some melodic elements are also back (e. g.

Evolving while closely connected to lifestyleToday’s German Techno has evolved widely, from hard, industrial trends to melodic and lyrical expressions, yet still maintains its iconic status as ““Berlin, the capital of techno. ’’ In conclusion, German Techno is both a cultural product of the past and a testing ground for the future of sound design. Listening to his works while tracing their history is nothing but understanding the dynamism of music, where cities and humans, machines and emotions intertwine.

    "body": "Cyber ​​funk that sounds decadent and sophisticated at the same timeText: mmr｜Theme: Electronic heartbeat born with breakdance IntroductionElectro is a trend of electronic music that emerged in the early 1980s. Based on funk and hip-hop rhythms, they have achieved a unique evolution by using the beats of rhythm machines, especially the Roland TR-808, as their core. The futuristic sound of deep bass kicks, dry snares, and synthesizers left a strong influence on later techno, house, electroclash, and even modern bass music. Origins of electro: resonance with hip-hopThe birth of electro is closely tied to the breakdance culture of the Bronx, New York. Afrika Bambaataa &amp; The Soulsonic Force – Planet Rock (1982)A historical masterpiece that samples Kraftwerk’s “Trans-Europe Express” and “Numbers” and fuses them with the rhythm of the TR-808. As a result, electro emerged as “futuristic hip-hop. ” ‘Planet Rock’ is widely acclaimed as the signature work of Afrika Bambaataa and The Soulsonic Force, whose innovative sound and pioneering approach hold a significant place in the history of hip-hop and dance music.

The silver costumes and cyber-style visuals embodied the sensibility of the era of ““the fusion of machines and humans. ’’ Intersection of techno and electroIn the late 1980s and 1990s, Detroit techno and electro were reunited. Drexciya (a legendary duo from Detroit) is a concept work themed around an undersea civilization, giving a mythical quality to hard electro beats. Juan Atkins (Model 500) was a pioneer in techno, as well as a prolific producer of electro-inspired tracks, freely straddling the boundaries between the two. This trend would later lead to IDM and glitch electronica. 2000s revival and electroclashIn the early 2000s, electro came back into the limelight. Electroclash: Driven by Miss Kittin &amp; The Hacker, Fischerspooner, Adult. and others. Their decadent, art-oriented sound was closely tied to the fashion industry. Electro House Connection: French/German artists like Justice and Digitalism have taken the club scene by storm by fusing electro-inspired synth riffs with house 4/4.

    "body": "Go beyond the sense of hearing to shake the body and space and connect listeners with each otherText: mmr｜Theme: The birth and cultural influence of dubstep The birth of dubstep - from the basements of South LondonDubstep was born in the underground scene of south London in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It is characterized by an aesthetic that can be described as ““bass supremacy”’ while drawing on the trends of UK garage, 2-step, jungle, and drum”n’bass. London at the time was a melting pot of immigrant cultures, with deep roots in reggae, dub, and Jamaican sound system culture. Dubstep, which was born from this soil, has undergone a unique evolution centered on heavy sub-bass, dark and tight spatiality, and subdivided rhythms. Sound characteristicsDubstep is supported by the physical pressure of bass sounds, so much so that it is said to be ““music that you listen to with your body. ’’    Tempo: BPM approximately 138-142.     Rhythm: Broken beat structure derived from 2-step. The kick is not a four-beat beat, but the snare is emphasized on the third beat.     Bass: Characterized by deep sub-bass, distorted bass line, and so-called “Wobble Bass”.     Mood: Dark, minimal or experimental sound design.  Representative early artists include Skream, Benga, Digital Mystikz (Mala &amp; Coki), and Loefah. Their activities revolved around the legendary London club Plastic People. Media and events that supported the scene   DMZ: A club event hosted by Digital Mystikz, a symbol of dubstep.     Rinse FM: A pirate radio station that promoted the experimental sounds of unknown artists.     Hatcha’s DJ Set: An important element that defined early dubstep.  International expansion and transformationFrom around 2008, dubstep spread beyond the UK underground and spread around the world.    Break in America: A more aggressive and flashy ““Brostep’’ has appeared, led by Skrillex.     Remix culture: Dubstep elements were brought into pop, rock, and hip-hop, gaining a wide range of listeners.     Diversification: Evolved from a dark and heavy sound to a melodious and dramatic sound.  Dubstep in JapanIt gradually became popular in Japan in the late 2000s, and Goth-Trad attracted worldwide attention. His sound has undergone a unique evolution, incorporating the context of noise/experimental music while also linking to the London scene. A uniquely Japanese dubstep culture was formed through events held at clubs in Shibuya and releases from domestic labels. Cultural influence of dubstep   Penetration into the EDM scene: Connected with festival culture and becoming a presence that resonates on the main stage.     Re-evaluation of bass music: Significantly influenced the development of subsequent genres such as trap and future bass.     Innovation in sound design: Production methods that make full use of soft synths and samplers became standardized, and spread throughout modern electronic music.  Representative works (published by Monumental Movement) Skrillex – Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites→ A monumental work that spread dubstep worldwide.  Zed Bias – Ambush Riddim / Cosmic Minefield→ A piece that bridged the gap from garage to dubstep.  Benga &amp; Walsh vs Darqwan – Addicts / Megatection→ A classic featuring the stalwarts of the UK scene.  Distance – Night Vision Traffic (Remixes)→ A rich remix album featuring Skream, Goth-Trad and others. Soundscapes symbolizing 21st century urban cultureMore than just a genre, dubstep has become an iconic soundscape of 21st century urban culture. The bass vibrations experienced through a club’s sound system go beyond the sense of hearing, shaking the body and space, and connecting listeners with each other. Dubstep continues to evolve and will continue to be an exciting musical exploration ground for new generations. "

    "body": "–Harmony with nature, self-reflection, and healing–Text: mmr｜Theme: Deep relationship with New Age ideology and counterculture Definition and characteristicsNew Age music is a music genre that spread mainly in Europe and America from the late 1970s to the 1980s, and refers to a style that is often listened to in the context of meditation, relaxation, and the spiritual world. It has developed through a mix of ambient, contemporary, ethnic, and environmental music, and is characterized by a meditative, non-aggressive sound that makes full use of synthesizers and acoustic instruments. The melodies are simple, often with long sustained notes and repeated structures, and the rhythms are often purposely omitted or very slow. For this reason, it played a role as “healing music” and was associated with spiritual lifestyles and back-to-nature movements. Origin and historical background1970s: With the rise of interest in New Age thought and Eastern philosophy, it spread among people who wanted to meditate and return to nature. Krautrock (Tangerine Dream, Popol Vuh, etc. ) and the ambient works of Brian Eno became the soil. 1980s: Labels such as Windham Hill Records and Private Music were established, and artists such as George Winston and Kitaro gained worldwide popularity. The term “New Age” becomes established as a category in the music market. 1990s: Taking advantage of the “healing” boom of the CD era, compilations combining environmental and natural sounds were mass-produced and became popular in Japan as “healing music. ” The Grammy Awards will also establish a ““Best New Age Album’’ category. After the 2000s: There was a time when it was looked down upon as “spiritual background music,” but it was reconsidered along with the reappraisal of ambient and drone music, and has been revived as a listening option on streaming services such as Spotify and YouTube. Representative artists and works   Brian Eno: “Ambient 1: Music for Airports” - Connecting the origins of New Age and Ambient.     Kitaro: A magnificent soundscape that makes full use of synthesizers. Known worldwide for NHK’s ““Silk Road. ’’     George Winston: A tranquil sound world of solo piano. Works with a seasonal feel, such as “December. ”     Andreas Vollenweider: Popular for his fantastical performances using the electric harp.     Enigma: A worldwide hit with “Sadeness (Part I),” a fusion of Gregorian chant and synth.     Yanni: Gained popularity in the 90s for her stage performances with a symphonic scale.  Cultural/ideological backgroundNew Age music was not just a musical genre, but had a deep relationship with New Age ideas and counterculture. Incorporating spiritual elements such as Eastern philosophy, Indian thought, meditation, and nature worship, he aims to liberate himself from city life. It resonated with environmental music and the ecology movement, and was a cultural phenomenon that symbolized ““harmony with nature. ’’ It has spread to all aspects of lifestyle such as art, architecture, yoga and healing, forming a culture that transcends genres. Contemporary reappraisalCurrent new age music has moved away from being simply “healing music” and is being evaluated in a new way in the following context.    Lo-fi and chill-out culture: Renewed attention as “listening music” in the streaming era.     Analog return: Works from the 1980s and 1990s are being unearthed amid record reissues and cassette culture.     Resurrection of Ambient: Modern composers (Laraaji, Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, etc. ) reconstitute New Age elements in a modern way.     Wellness Industry: New Age musical sounds now standard in mindfulness, yoga, meditation apps, and more.  Embodying an “oasis of sound”New Age music was often described as ““background music”, to put it bluntly. However, its meditative and non-aggressive sound has come to embody the ““sound oasis” sought by people as urbanization and information technology progress. In modern times, it has been reabsorbed into genres such as ambient and chillout, but its ideals - harmony with nature, introspection, and healing - have become even more urgent. New Age is not a passing fad of the past, but a music culture that continues to quietly but surely play a role in people’s lives. "

    "title": "[Column] Tresor - The techno mecca that changed the world from underground in Berlin",
    "body": "An indispensable presence when talking about Berlin’s club culture and the European techno scene – TresorText: mmr｜Theme: Berlin club culture and the European techno scene What is Tresor?Tresor (meaning ““safe”’ in German) is a club that was founded in Berlin, Germany in 1991, and is a center of techno culture that also hosts a label of the same name. Amidst the chaos that followed the end of the Cold War, it served as the most important center for connecting Detroit techno and Berlin”s underground culture, and continues to maintain its international influence to this day. Background of its birth: Berlin and the post-Cold War vacuumIn 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. Spaces that were once controlled by the state have turned into ““lawless zones’’ and become testing grounds for underground youth culture. Abandoned buildings, disused factories, and underground spaces have been turned into clubs. Western and Eastern cultures fused, and dance music, a symbol of freedom, resonated. Among them, Tresor opened in a renovated vault of a former department store. The deep bass sound emanating from behind the closed iron door symbolized the beginning of a new era. Musical Significance: The Bridge Between Detroit and BerlinTresor, in particular, served as a springboard for Detroit techno’s expansion into Europe. Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson are the founders of Detroit, known as the “Belleville Three. ” Jeff Mills, Blake Baxter, Underground Resistance and others are active in Berlin and play at Tresor. As a result, the futuristic and political techno born in the United States was linked with European club culture, creating the foundation for a ““global techno network. ’’ Label “Tresor Records”Established in 1991 as an attached club, Tresor Records functions as an important techno label. Jeff Mills – Waveform Transmission Series Robert Hood – Internal Empire Drexciya – Neptune”s Lair He has released many works that symbolize the fusion of Detroit and Berlin. In particular, their minimal and hard sound formed the ““skeleton of European techno’’ in the 1990s. Tresor symbolism and cultural influenceFusion of industrial ruins and music Tresor is a symbol of “urban ruin reuse culture. ” It became the origin of an aesthetic that has been inherited throughout the Berlin club scene. 24 hour club culture In Berlin, where regulations were lax, a space was created where people could continue dancing morning, noon, and night. His style is still the subject of worldwide envy. Techno = urban identity The influence of Tresor is behind the city of Berlin officially recognizing club culture as a city brand. Relocation and current situationIn 2005, the original location closed, but in 2007 it moved to a former power plant in East Berlin. The huge, inorganic industrial space is more in line with the techno worldview. Today, DJs from all over the world perform there, and it continues to serve as a pilgrimage site. Comparison of Tresor with other clubsBerghain: An icon from the 2000s that also inherited the ruin culture. E-Werk, WMF: Both names were listed in the 90s, but Tresor has had the most lasting influence over the long term. → Tresor is often spoken of as the “founder” and Berghain as the “successor. ” Tresor’s legacy   International network connecting Detroit and Berlin     The cultural value of “techno = future image of the city”     Historical masterpieces through labels     Aesthetics of “placeness” that reuses ruins     The basis for Berlin being called the “Techno Capital of the World”  Must-listen to experience Tresor (10 recommended selections)   Jeff Mills – Waveform Transmission Vol. 1 (1992, Tresor)     Robert Hood – Internal Empire (1994, Tresor)     Underground Resistance – X-102: Discovers the Rings of Saturn (1992, Tresor)     Blake Baxter – Dream Sequence (1994, Tresor)     Juan Atkins – Skynet (1998, Tresor)     Drexciya – Neptune”s Lair (1999, Tresor)     Surgeon – Tresor. 117: Force + Form (1999)     Joey Beltram – Close Grind (2001)     Pacou – Symbolic Language (1998, Tresor)     Tresor Compilation series (especially Vol. 1 to Vol. 3)  Elevating the music of techno from a “temporary fad” to a “universal culture”More than just a club or a label, Tresor is a ““cultural crossroads”’ that connects Berlin”s history, post-Cold War urban space, and the future of black music in Detroit. The sounds released from that vault still reverberate in club culture around the world, elevating the music of techno from a ““transient fad” to ““universal culture. ” Related columns🔗 [Column] From the origins of techno to the present - a chronological history traced through famous records and equipment 🔗 [Column] Detroit Techno: Human dance created by the heartbeat of machines 🔗 The genealogy and present of German Techno - the aesthetics of sound spreading from Berlin to the world "

    "title": "[Column] New Wave: The intersection of post-punk music innovation and 1980s urban culture",
    "body": "New Wave is not just a genre, but a ““sensibility of the times’’ that inherits the experimental spirit of the post-punk era and fuses diverse music and cultures. **Text: mmr｜Theme: Post-punk era art movement From post-punk to new waveThe punk movement of 1976 shook up the music scene with its directness of being ““simple, fast, and anti-establishment. ” However, its explosive power was short-lived, and as punk became increasingly commercialized, many artists sought musical expansion while maintaining the ““punk spirit. ” The general term that was born from this experiment was ““New Wave. ’’ From an academic perspective, new wave is a concept that encompasses a variety of musical developments since post-punk, and rather than a strict genre name, it is a cultural label that refers to the consciousness and sensibilities of the times. Musical features and innovationsThe musical characteristics of new wave can be organized into the following elements:  Rise of the synthesizerWith the spread of analog synths and drum machines, mechanical and futuristic sounds were created. Gary Numan and Ultravox are prime examples.  Cross-genreThey freely incorporated funk rhythms (Talking Heads), reggae grooves (The Police), and disco dance feel (Blondie), transcending genre boundaries.  Coexistence of pop and experimentWhile Joy Division and The Cure pursued a dark, experimental sound, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet aimed for a flashy, catchy pop style.  Social Criticism and IronyThe lyrics reflected the alienation of urban life, Cold War anxieties, and satire on technological society. Devo’s sarcastic performance is a symbol of this. From a musical perspective, new wave can be seen as a movement based on the triadic simplicity of punk, with the expansion of electronic sound and the intelligence of art rock. Fashion and subcultureNew Wave was not only a movement in music, but also in visual culture.  The advent of MTV (1981)Music videos became the focus of promotion, and bands like Duran Duran and A Flock of Seagulls integrated visual aesthetics and music, making new wave a ““visual-sound fusion genre. ’’  FashionWhile inheriting the DIY spirit of punk, neo-romanticism presented a gorgeous and androgynous fashion. Silk shirts, eyeliner, and bright colors were iconic. On the other hand, the synth pop group created a ““cold urban atmosphere’’ with monochrome futuristic costumes.  Relationship with artNew York”s Talking Heads is centered around art school graduate David Byrne, and incorporates influences from minimal art and conceptual art. In the UK, Vivienne Westwood”s fashion and post-pop art design sensibilities are directly connected. Social and geopolitical contextThe diversity of the new wave is deeply tied to the social context in which it was born.    UK: Economic crisis in the late 1970s, rising unemployment rate under Thatcher administration. Young people felt a ““feeling of stagnation with no tomorrow,’’ and they projected this into music and fashion.     America: Linked to the New York art scene (CBGB, Mudd Club), it spread as intellectual experimental music after punk.     Japan: Against the backdrop of high economic growth and advances in technology, “techno new wave” such as YMO and Plastics gained international recognition.  Against this background, new wave is not just a musical genre, but a reflection of urban culture and generational consciousness during the Cold War. Decline and SuccessionFrom the mid-1980s onward, New Wave gradually became pop-oriented and commercialized, and was absorbed into popular culture by combining it with MTV-like image strategies. But the spirit was passed on to the next generation:    Alternative Rock (R. E. M. , The Smiths, later Nirvana)     Synthpop/Electropop (after Depeche Mode, modern CHVRCHES, Grimes)     Post-punk revival (2000’s Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, The Strokes)  New Wave was a major turning point in music history in that it ““crossed genre boundaries and elevated music to a cultural movement. ’’ Post-punk era art movement, not a genreNew wave originated from punk in the 1970s, and was an important movement in music history that incorporated electronic technology, crossed genres, and was socially critical. At the same time, it was an overall cultural movement that symbolized 1980s urban culture, involving fashion, video, art, and lifestyle. New Wave is a ““comprehensive art of the era’’ in which music, art, social criticism, and fashion are intricately intertwined. "

    "body": "Dance music that symbolizes liberation and identityText: mmr｜Theme: Symbolic music of “liberation and solidarity” that overlaps with American gay culture and the era of the HIV/AIDS crisis Birth of Hi-NRG and gay club cultureFrom the late 1970s to the 1980s, Hi-NRG (High Energy) emerged as an electronic and fast-paced dance music derived from disco. The sound was characterized by fast tempos (120-140 BPM), synth-based riffs, and dramatic female vocals, and had a more cathartic and energetic feel than traditional disco. Hi-NRG had a particularly strong following in gay clubs. After the Stonewall Riots in the 1970s, the LGBTQ community sought a place for their expression and identity in the club scene, and Hi-NRG functioned as their “music of liberation. ” Role of Hi-NRG in LGBTQ🌈 symbol of freedom At a time when homosexuality was still subject to discrimination and prejudice, Hi-NRG provided “a space where people could dance and love each other without being tied down by anyone. ” Club dance floors were safe spaces where people could escape from the oppression of society, and Hi-NRG was essential as background music. 🌈 Expression of identity Hi-NRG’s lyrics often have themes of love, desire, and self-liberation, and they resonate not only with straight love, but also with the earnest feelings of LGBTQ people. For example, Evelyn Thomas”s ““High Energy” and Hazell Dean”s ““Searchin”’ became deeply engraved in the club scene as gay anthems. 🌈 Fusion with drug culture Bobby Orlando”s Divine songs (e. g. “You Think You”re a Man”) are emblematic of the direct connection between Hi-NRG and drag queen culture. Her performances were radical and provocative, breaking down the boundaries of music and gender expression. Relationship between representative artists and LGBTQ peopleSylvester A singer who was openly gay. Their signature song “You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)” is the origin of Hi-NRG and is a timeless masterpiece as a gay anthem. Hazell Dean A UK Hi-NRG singer who was so supported in the club scene that she was called the “gay queen. ” Many of her songs speak for LGBTQ love and desire. Divine While active as a drag queen, she gained worldwide attention with Hi-NRG. Boldly displaying sexual expression, they integrated music and gender politics. Evelyn ThomasA diva who defined the genre with her signature song “High Energy. ” It was explosively popular in gay clubs and spread Hi-NRG worldwide. Hi-NRG and the HIV/AIDS crisisIn the 1980s, HIV/AIDS struck the LGBTQ community and claimed many lives. During this period, Hi-NRG became both an escape to forget one’s sorrows and a soundtrack of life and death in memory of fallen comrades. Sylvester himself died of AIDS, but his music continues to be played in clubs today. Hi-NRG’s legacy and modern impactHi-NRG eventually evolved into Chicago house and Eurobeat, and has left an influence on today’s EDM and hyperpop. Particularly in the LGBTQ community, Hi-NRG classics continue to be played at Pride events and gay clubs, providing a way to relive that sense of freedom. Contemporary Drag Race culture and hyper-pop artists (SOPHIE, Kim Petras, etc. ) carry Hi-NRG’s DNA of exaggerated energy and gender expression. More than just dance music, it’s a symbol of freedom and liberationHi-NRG is more than just “dance music”; it is a genre that embodies the history, struggle, and liberation of the LGBTQ community. Driving beats and shimmering synths were a celebration of life and a means of escaping society’s oppression for gay clubs in the 1980s. Even today, Hi-NRG continues to be reevaluated as an essential presence when discussing the relationship between music and sexuality. "

    "body": "First of all, what is deep house?Text: mmr｜Theme: Deep House, a genre that continues to quietly evolve while incorporating history and context. Deep house is a strain of house that emerged in the Chicago-New Jersey area in the late 1980s. Characterized by soul/jazz harmonies, smooth bass, and a restrained groove, it is a type of dance music that is ““deep, long, and warms the body’’ rather than a rush peak. BPM is generally 118–124 (slow to medium speed), 7th/9th chords, electric piano (Rhodes), organ (Korg M1 series), and laid-back vocals are symbolic. It has a “night temperature” that is valid for both the floor and listening. Background and development of birth1985–90: Early Early (Chicago/NJ) Larry Heard (Mr. Fingers) presents the prototype with “Can You Feel It” and “Mystery of Love. ” Following the flow of Frankie Knuckles and Marshall Jefferson, a fusion of Jersey Garage’s sweet soul feel (Blaze and Kerri Chandler). 1990s: Deepening and diversification Chicago”s Ron Trent &amp; Chez Damier (Prescription), New York”s Masters At Work (MAW), and Detroit’s Moodymann expand on the “black” texture. The number of bases will increase in the UK and Germany, creating a bridge between deep and tech. 2000s: Listening orientation and sophistication Naked Music, Jimpster (Freerange) and more will take you to the lounge-soulful sophistication. In Germany, Henrik Schwarz, Âme, and Dixon (Innervisions) are popular for their minimalist to modern architectural aesthetics. 2010s and beyond: bifurcation and globalization Anjunadeep and All Day I Dream turned to melodic/organic music. In South Africa, Black Coffee brings Afro-Deep to world-class standards. With the DIY wave, lo-fi houses are also on the rise. Musical featuresHarmony: Major 7th/9th, suspension chord, lots of tension. Even in a minor key, there is a nuance of “sadness≠tragic”. Beat: The kick has a round and deep aftertaste. The hi-hat is a shuffle to a light swing. 909/707/727 and 808 textures are standard. Bass: Mainly undulating long notes with carefully controlled subbands. Keyboard/Texture: Rhodes/M1 organ/soft strings, space type (delay/reverb) is long but not dense. Vocal: Speaking low to mid range, gospel to soul lineage. Make use of “pause” by using the necessary and sufficient number of words. Must-listen artists/labelsOriginal source: Larry Heard (Mr. Fingers)/Kerri Chandler/Blaze Core: Ron Trent &amp; Chez Damier (Prescription) / Moodymann (KDJ) / MAW (including Nuyorican Soul) 2000s Sophistication: Jimpster (Freerange) / Miguel Migs &amp; Blue Six (Naked Music) Modern ~ Melodic: Âme/Dixon (Innervisions)/Maya Jane Coles Afro Deep: Black Coffee/Culoe De Song/Da Capo Japanese (deep house feel): Soichi Terada/Susumu Yokota (Far East Recording)/around Mule Musiq Major labels: Prescription, KDJ, Strictly Rhythm, Nu Groove, Guidance, Freerange, Delusions of Grandeur, Innervisions, Mule Musiq, Anjunadeep, All Day I Dream “First 3 pieces”    Mr. Fingers – Amnesia     Ron Trent – ​​Altered States     Kerri Chandler – Atmosphere  Subgenres and peripheral lineagesChicago Deep: Heavy kick + soul reverb. Example: Mr. Fingers, Ron Trent. Jersey/garage type: Piano/organ and gospel-like vocals. Example: Kerri Chandler, Blaze. Detroit Deep: Lo-fi texture with a jazz-soul feel. Example: Moodymann, Theo Parrish (on the border). Deep Tech: Tight low end and minimal repetition. Example: Smallville/Underground Quality. Melodic/Organic: Wide pads and scenic chords, live instruments and natural sounds. Example: Anjunadeep, All Day I Dream. Afro Deep: Polyrhythm, call and response, and high-temperature percussion. Lo-fi House: Warm saturation, 90s sample feel. What “good deep house DJs” do   Gradually layer EQ and faders on long mixes (16-32 bars or more).     Matching key (tonality) and tesserae (timbre): Avoid destroying the atmosphere by selecting songs in adjacent keys/closely related tones.     Dynamic waves: “Raise the heat a little bit and bring it back quickly” for 30-45 minutes.     BPM setting that is not too fast: Create a “stride length” at 118–121, then move to 122–124 in the second half.  Production TipsCode: “Soft margin” with maj7, min9, sus2/4, 6th. Even just the two notes of root + 9th are “deep”. Tone selection: Rhodes, M1 Organ, Juno pad, analog sub. The hi-hat is slightly open and thin. Groove: “Breathe” with a light swing (+5 to +15%) and minute changes in velocity. Low Pass/Side Chain: Adds “invisible oscillation” to keep it in ear contact while making it dance. Sampling: Loop a short jazz/soul phrase and let it melt into the space with a long decay. Mix: Kick 40–60Hz is modest, 80–120Hz creates body rumble. Vocals should not output too much 2–5kHz. Scene and CultureLocation: Strong in small boxes/subfloors/after hours. Listening context: Late night drive, work/study BGM, cocktail time. Aesthetics: ““Emotional over functionality’’. More shadow than sparkle. Playlist template (flow example)Warm-up: Blaze style organ groove Early peak: Ron Trent/Chez Damier’s driving force Plateau: Refinement of Jimpster to Freerange Color change: Henrik Schwarz’s live feel Late: Maintain the temperature with Black Coffee’s Afro Deep, and cool down with the lingering sound of Larry Heard at the end. Tips for collecting and searching recordsKeywords: “Deep” “Atmospheric” “Dub” “Garage” “Jersey” “Prescription” Choose by era: Early 90s = rough and warm, 00s = sophisticated, 10s and later = wide sound image. Label buy: Prescription/KDJ/Freerange/Innervisions/Mule Musiq/Anjunadeep. Must listen to the B-side: Deep tracks tend to be hidden in the B-side dub. Quick discography (10 introductory songs)・Mr. Fingers – “Can You Feel It” ・Larry Heard Presents Mr. White – “The Sun Can”t Compare” ・Kerri Chandler – “Atmosphere” ・Ron Trent – ​​”Altered States” ・Chez Damier – “I Never Knew Love” ・Moodymann – “Shades of Jae” ・Masters At Work – “To Be In Love (MAW Dub)” ・Jimpster – “Dangly Panther” ・Âme – “Rej” ・Black Coffee – “Turn Me On (feat. Bucie)” Music that can be enjoyed over time, not in a momentDeep house is music that can be enjoyed over time. Rather than a single, conspicuous hit, there is a ““comfortable continuation’’ that keeps the floor and listeners in sync with each other. If you understand everything from historical origins to current sub-styles, and the secrets of production and DJing, you will be able to greatly deepen your selection and appreciation. "

    "body": "What is Acid Jazz?Text: mmr｜Theme: Social and geopolitical background behind Acid Jazz Birth and definition of acid jazzAcid Jazz is a musical movement that originated in London in the late 1980s, and is characterized by a crossover sound that mixes jazz, funk, soul, hip-hop, Latin, and rare groove. The origin of the name goes back to the label ““Acid Jazz Records’’ founded by DJ [Gilles Peterson] (https://amzn. to/3KOnzMr) and record producer [Eddie Piller] (https://amzn. to/4hdwdAb). In the club scene of the 1980s, there was a growing movement to reevaluate black music in response to the enthusiasm for acid house and hip-hop. Acid jazz emerged as ““danceable jazz” and ““soulful music suitable for clubs. ” Musical featuresAcid jazz tends to refer to a ““hybrid feeling’’ rather than a single genre. Characteristic elements include:    Groove emphasis: Inheriting the rhythmic feel of 70’s funk and rare grooves     Improvisation: Introducing solos and interplays derived from jazz     Club-oriented: Remix-like development with DJ play and dance floor in mind     Sampling Culture: Incorporating a hip-hop approach and reconstructing past jazz-funk sound sources     Urban sophistication: Has a stylish mood with a mix of Latin and soul.  As a result, acid jazz established a new style of ““intellectual and danceable music. ’’ British social backgroundIn the 1980s, Britain was in an environment of widening economic disparity under the Thatcher government, the growth of immigrant communities, and the rise of rave culture.    Immigrant culture: Caribbean and African immigrant communities brought reggae, funk and soul to form the basis of London’s club scene.     Post-industrial society: The decline of manufacturing and the deterioration of cities gave youth culture “deconstructive” values, and club culture became its refuge.     Media Influence: BBC Radio and Pirate Radio introduced Acid Jazz, leading to its spread from the underground to the mainstream.  Geopolitical context of surrounding countriesThe spread of Acid Jazz was also closely related to geopolitics in Europe, the United States, and Asia. UK Scene Incognito: The most important band led by Bluey (Jean-Paul “Bluey” Maunick). A fusion of funk and soul, featuring elegant horns and female vocals.  Brand New Heavies: Groovy and soulful band sound. In the 1990s, they also made it onto the US R&amp;B charts.  Jamiroquai: A band led by Jay Kay. Based on funk and acid jazz, he became an international hit with his ecological message and charisma.  Galliano: Produced by Gilles Peterson. The fusion of rap and jazz gives it a more street feel. International expansionUS sceneAcid Jazz was perceived as a “reimport. ” In the United States, the original 70’s jazz funk and soul existed, so the label ““Acid Jazz’’ from the UK seemed fresh and was adopted by the club scenes of New York and Chicago. And, like Deee-Lite, it expands while linking with hip-hop. On the other hand, the connection with hip-hop was emphasized, and it served as a bridge to jazz-hip-hop such as A Tribe Called Quest and Gang Starr. Japan/Asia SceneIn Japan, the “club jazz” movement flourished in the 1980s and 1990s, and bands such as United Future Organization (UFO) and Kyoto Jazz Massive inherited the Acid Jazz trend. It had an affinity with the consumer culture of the bubble economy and the Shibuya scene, and became a bridge between Europe and Asia. It gradually gained acceptance in countries such as South Korea and Taiwan from the late 1990s as club culture expanded. In Japan, United Future Organization (UFO) in particular received worldwide acclaim and became the face of acid jazz in the Tokyo club scene. Successors such as Ryota Nozaki (Jazztronik) continue this trend. Western Europe   France/Germany: In France, it was incorporated into “Nouvelle Scène Jazz” and club culture in Paris, and in Germany, it was incorporated into the experimental spirit of jazz/clubs centered in West Berlin around the time of reunification (1990).     Italy/Spain: Linked with tourism, Acid Jazz is established in resort culture and club scene. Particularly in Ibiza, it was mixed with house and Balearic.  Geopolitical expansion and post-Cold War cultureThe expansion of Acid Jazz mainly in Europe was also influenced by post-Cold War cultural liberalization. The end of the Cold War in the 1990s → Club culture was liberated in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and music that combined jazz, funk, and electronics was welcomed. Globalization → Immigrant culture centered in London spread musically through the “world city” network. Scene and Cultural BackgroundAcid jazz was more than just a music genre; it was a symbol of club and urban culture.    Club Scene: At the end of the 1980s, DJs played jazz-funk at London clubs such as “Dingwalls” and “The Wag Club,” and young people went wild.     Fashion: A mix of mods, suits, and urban streetwear, with a stylish, urban aesthetic.     Geopolitical context: Britain’s multicultural society (Caribbean immigrants, African diaspora, and Asian communities) has created cross-culture in London. Acid jazz can be said to be the epitome of this.  Decline and ReappraisalIn the late 1990s, acid jazz evolved into Nu-Jazz, Lounge, and Broken Beat, and its momentum as a scene converged. However, in recent years, it has been rediscovered on Spotify and YouTube, and young listeners are reappreciating its relaxed texture, which is similar to lo-fi hip-hop and chill-hop. In addition, it has played a major role as a bridge between club music and jazz, and has influenced the modern jazz revival (a new generation of jazz led by London’s [Shabaka Hutchings] (https://amzn. to/3W0xMYx) and others). A crystallization of sound that transforms urban diversity and sophistication into groovesAcid jazz is ““intellectual and danceable music’’ that was born out of the urban culture and club scene of the 1980s and 1990s, and redefined the jazz tradition into club culture. That spirit is still alive in Nu-Jazz and modern chill beats, and it was not just a passing fad, but an important crossroads in music history. The music was born from the fusion of London’s immigrant culture, club culture, and the dissatisfaction of post-industrial society. In Europe, it developed into tourism and urban culture after reunification, in the United States, it was combined with hip-hop, and in Japan, it developed into Shibuya-kei and club jazz. The end of the Cold War and globalization encouraged its proliferation, and it served as a geopolitical symbol of freedom and exchange. Acid jazz is the crystallization of sounds that translate urban diversity and sophistication into grooves. "

    "title": "[Column] EBM: Electronic physicality driven by steel beats",
    "body": "What is Electronic Body Music?Text: mmr｜Theme: What is electronic body music? Origin: Industrial reverberations and mechanical rhythmsEBM is a genre of electronic music that originated in Europe (mainly Belgium and Germany) in the early 1980s. The name comes from the fact that the music is composed of a physical dance groove and electronics. This can be described as a fusion of industrial music and electronic dance music. In particular, the following two groups are known as pioneers:    Front 242 (Belgium)     DAF (Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, Germany)  By making full use of cold, sharp electronics, violent minimal beats, and militaristic vocals, they created a new kind of “physical electronic music” that differs from conventional pop and rock. Sound characteristicsTo put it simply, EBM’s sound is “inorganic and physical. ” It features the following elements: Hard and minimal beat   Mainly 4/4 time signature, BPM around 120-140     Mechanical rhythm like industrial machinery     Heavy use of drum machines (Roland TR-808, TR-909, etc. )  Synthesizers and Sequencers   Monochrome, dark, heavy synth sound     Loop configuration driven by analog/digital sequencer     Balancing the trance state and physicality created by repetition  Vocal   Low, inorganic voices, mostly male voices     Speaks in a commanding tone, slogan-like rather than singing.     Often mixed with German, English, and French     Many voices are distorted  Theme and aesthetics   War, surveillance, mechanization, human alienation, political irony     European anxiety and social structure criticism during the Cold War     Factories, cities, military uniforms, fetishism, leather culture  Main artists and worksArtistCountryRepresentative song/albumFront 242Belgium Headhunter , Geography (1982)DAFGermany Der Mussolini , Alles ist gut (1981)Nitzer EbbUnited Kingdom Join in the Chant , That Total Age (1987)KlinikBelgium Moving Hands Skinny PuppyCanada Assimilate Die KruppsGermanyEvolution from EBM to metal fusionScene spread and influenceEBM rapidly spread in the club scene and underground from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. It had a strong influence on the electronic music scene in various parts of Europe, especially in Germany, Sweden, Austria, and France. EBM has also had a huge influence on the following genres:    Industrial rock/metal (e. g. Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, Rammstein)     Techno, acid techno     Electrocrush, Dark Electro, Aggrotech     Goth/Industrial Club Culture (Cybergoth)  Connection with club culture: EBM as body musicEBM is not just music to be listened to at home, but has a very strong aspect as ““music for dancing. ’’ Since the late 1980s, EBM has become an established culture, centered around specific nightclubs and festivals (e. g. Wave-Gotik-Treffen, Amphi Festival), accompanied by dark clothing, leather, and cyber costumes. In the 1990s, while being looked back on as “Old School EBM”, the scene branched out into the following:    Futurepop (VNV Nation, Covenant, etc. )     Dark Electro / Harsh EBM (Suicide Commando, Hocico, etc. )     Techno Body Music (TBM): EBM revival by techno DJs (Helena Hauff, Ancient Methods)  Recent revival and current EBMSince the 2010s, along with the techno-industrial revival, EBM has been reevaluated. Contemporary Artist   Phase Fatale     Kris Baha     Boy Harsher     Linea Aspera     Years of Denial  These artists are influenced by EBM, but combine it with elements such as coldwave, synthwave, and post-punk to create new forms of EBM. Distinctive trends   Refocusing on analog equipment and hardware live performances     Independent cassette/vinyl releases     Cyberpunk/DIY revival in terms of fashion     Return to “physical” DJ sets at clubs/raves  Aesthetics that fuses physical body and electronicsAs the name suggests, EBM is “electronic body music. ” It was more than just dance music, it was a total form of expression: political, mechanical, physical, and rebellious. Currently, the influence of EBM is spreading across many fields, from club culture and festivals to the DIY scene, art, and fashion. And above all——The “heat” that resides in that inorganic rhythm moves the body. That is the essential appeal of EBM. "

    "body": "Hardware screams, body respondsText: mmr｜Theme: Chemical reactions of sound and cultural transformation Origin: Radiation from underground in ChicagoAcid house is a music genre that originated from the underground club scene in Chicago, USA in the mid-1980s, and is a subgenre of house music. The origin of this genre was born from the “accidental misuse” of an electronic instrument called the Roland TB-303 Bass Line Synthesizer. Originally developed as a bass guitar replacement, the TB-303 was used by DJs and producers (particularly from a unit called Phuture) in unexpected ways, producing undulating, ““liquid” and ““psychedelic” basslines. Phuture’s 1987 single “Acid Tracks” became the prototype for this new style, both in sonic character and name. Sound characteristics: Chemical sound image brought about by TB-303The most important characteristics of acid house are the following sound elements: Baseline with TB-303   Unique “purpy” and “squish” sound     Mysterious acoustic changes caused by filter resonance and slide     Analog randomness and manual operation organicity  Quadruple kick   BPM is a stable tempo of around 120-130     Standard combination with drum pattern by TR-808 or TR-909  Minimal structure   Trip feeling due to repeated loops     Create a sense of ecstasy with long build-ups and detailed changes  This sound had a tremendous effect as a ““chemical sound’’ that lulled dancers into a trance-like state in the darkness of a club or with strobe lights. Spread to Britain: Summer of Love and the Second WaveAcid house rapidly spread to the UK from the end of 1987 to 1988. Club DJs brought Chicago’s white label back to the UK, where it quickly spread through the London and Manchester club scenes. “Second Summer of Love”: 1988   The connection between acid house and ecstasy (MDMA)     Expanding from inner city club to outdoor rave     Centered in Shoom, London and Haçienda, Manchester  UK artists who have influenced me   A Guy Called Gerald “Voodoo Ray”     808 State “Pacific State”     Rave style with acid elements such as The KLF and Orbital  Fashion and symbols: smiley faces and DIY cultureAcid house influenced not only music, but also visual and youth culture.

Acid never killsAcid house is a rare musical culture born from the intersection of accidental technological innovation and the spirit of the times. More than 30 years later, the sound of the TB-303 continues to resonate on club floors and digital spaces, and continues to inspire future musicians. Acid is not a reverberation of the past, but a sonic mutant that continues to evolve.

    "title": "[Column] What is Downtempo? The aesthetics of chill-out and deep rhythms",
    "body": "Gentle time and deep sound fluctuationsText: mmr｜Theme: Chill-out and the aesthetics of deep rhythm What is downtempo?“Downtempo”, as the name suggests, is a type of electronic music with a slow tempo. Generally, the BPM (tempo) is around 60 to 110, and it is characterized by relaxing rhythms and sounds aimed at listening and chilling out, rather than intense beats for clubs. In between the throbbing heartbeat and the hustle and bustle, a sudden silence appears. If it”s music, downtempo is that moment of deep breathing. In the world of club culture and electronic music, it is a music genre that is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the fast beats of techno and house, but it is close to the listener”s emotions and blends into the city night. That’s downtempo. Downtempo is created through the intersection of multiple genres, including the floating feel of ambient, the grooves of hip-hop, and the organic elements of jazz and soul. Although it often overlaps with styles such as chillout, trip hop, and lounge music, it is also used as a general term for a gentle groove that encompasses these styles. 90’s Chill Out RevolutionFrom the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the concept of a ““chill-out room’’ spread in club culture, mainly in the UK. This is a relaxing space away from the loud noise of the main floor. The music that was playing in this space can be said to be the prototype of downtempo. Waves from Bristol, UKBefore the word downtempo became established, the music that could be considered its prototype was born in Bristol, England in the early 1990s. Artists like Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky explored styles that incorporated elements of dub, soul, jazz, and electronica with hip-hop beats. The result was trip-hop, the spiritual starting point for downtempo. Balearic Chill and Café del Mar On the other hand, ““Balearic Chill”’, which spread around Café del Mar in Ibiza, Spain, is also deeply involved in downtempo. José Padilla”s calm, resort-like mixes were popular as music to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, and became the prototype for later lounge-style downtempo music. In particular, artists such as Massive Attack, Portishead, and Nightmares on Wax combined hip-hop, jazz, soul, and reggae with slow beats, forming a subgenre known as trip-hop. This became a worldwide hit, and the outline of downtempo became clear. Sound structure and aestheticsThe structure of downtempo songs varies, but the common denominator is a subdued beat and spatial production. The following characteristics can be seen:    Loopy beats (breakbeats and hip-hop-derived drums)     deep warm bass line     Effect-processed pads and samples     Quiet vocal or instrumental focus     Sometimes includes elements of jazz, bossa nova, and reggae  Tempo: BPM is around 60-110. A relaxing speed that is slightly slower than your heartbeat. Rhythm: There are many hip-hop style breakbeats or simple beats similar to ambient. Tone/Sound: A fusion of electronics, acoustic instruments, environmental sounds, and samples of jazz and soul. Atmosphere: Introspective, floating, urban, melancholic, or spiritual. Derivation and diversification: Downtempo around the worldDowntempo has undergone various evolutions through its fusion with local culture and ethnic music. Lounge music: Evolved as music played in hotels and cafes (e. g. Thievery Corporation) Chillout/Balearic: Mediterranean sound associated with beach culture (e. g. Café del Mar) Lo-fi hiphop: A new trend of jazz x downtempo x nostalgia that has expanded on YouTube etc. (e. g. Nujabes, Jinsang) Modernity and Reappraisal: The Silent Rulers of the Spotify EraIn the streaming era of the 2020s, downtempo is being reevaluated as a “relaxing playlist” and “background music for work. ” In particular, the modern downtempo style known as post-trip hop has found its way into film music, game music, and even the fashion industry. While it is gaining attention again in the context of ““chill”, ““relaxation”, and ““concentration”, there are many playlists on Spotify and YouTube called ““Lo-Fi,” ““Chillhop,” and ““Study Beats,” which are familiar to listeners as downtempo in a broad sense. In addition, the boundaries between environmental music and ambient music have become blurred, and music continues to evolve as music that is more closely aligned with an individual’s psychological state and life scene. Artists such as Bonobo, Tycho, Khruangbin, and Japan’s Pictured Resort and Cuushe are important players in modern Downtempo. The art of sound that soothes the emotionsDowntempo is the complete opposite of party frenzy, but it has become an important style of music that supports modern people’s emotions, focus, and recovery. Its power, which is inconspicuous but definitely acts on the mind, is truly a ““quiet ruler. ’’ In this day and age where technology is evolving and everything is accelerating, choosing to slow down is a very radical and humane choice. Downtempo is music that allows you to dive deep into emotion and space without competing for speed. The next time you feel like ““I want to forget about time and drift away’’, I hope you will step into the world of downtempo.

    "body": "Miraculous encounter “Eurobeat x Parapara”Text: mmr｜Theme: Synchronicity of dance and music At the heart of gyaru culture in Japan in the 1990s was a hand-waving dance called “parapara. ” The music genre that has spread like one and the same is ““Eurobeat’’. Why did Eurobeat, which was born in Europe and evolved in its own way in Asia, become deeply connected to the Parapara style in Japan?There was a mix of factors such as not only musical characteristics but also club culture, media strategy, and consumer psychology. What is Eurobeat? ─ Evolution of Italo DiscoEurobeat has its roots in “Italo Disco”, which was born in Italy in the 1980s. Adding elements of high energy (Hi-NRG), the tempo changes to a catchy, synth-driven sound. ● Main musical characteristics    BPM: 140-160 and very fast     Structure: Clear chorus, frequent use of refrains     Rhythm: 4/4 drum + handclap     Melody: Bright, dramatic, and melancholy  This structure was a perfect match for the parapara dance, which repeats the same pattern. What is Parapara? ──Pleasure of uniform repetition● Origin of Parapara    Occurred in the late 1980s at discos in Roppongi and Shibuya, Tokyo (Maharaja, Juliana Tokyo, etc. )     Group dance with finely aligned hand movements up, down, left and right     Movement emphasizes “unity” rather than individuality: Closer to “team” than social dance  ● Why did it match the euro?    Fast tempo → Easy to synchronize hand gestures and rhythm     Clear A melody/chorus structure → Easy to create dance “choreography”     Dramatic song development → matches the climax of the swing  Avex’s strategy: Eurobeat = Japan-only format● Birth of the “SUPER EUROBEAT” series (1990-)    Compilation series produced in Italy, exclusively for the Japanese market     “Linked products” that connect ParaPara Floor and CD shops     Choreography explanations will be published on jackets and booklets.  ● Signed with a Eurobeat exclusive label Italian labels such as Time, A-Beat C, and Delta have signed exclusive contracts with avex to produce music specifically for the Japanese market. In this way, Japan’s unique ““Eurobeat market’’ was formed and gradually became integrated. Gyaru culture and charisma: Consumed dance● To “ParaPara = symbol of gal culture”    Closely linked to Shibuya 109 fashion     Distribution of choreography videos (VHS, later DVD)     Series such as “Parapara Paradise” and “Parapara Kyonen” also appear  ● Media production    “Gal charisma” introduces choreography on TV programs and magazines     Effectively Eurobeat becomes mainstream as a teen trend     “Remembering = a ritual of participation” and creating a culture of peer pressure and unity  Revival of ParaPara and internet culture● After the mid-2000s: End of the boom and underground    Changes in gyaru culture, transition to mobile phones and the internet     “Revival events” continue at some clubs  ● “Wake-up” of the YouTube generation    A second parapara boom occurs locally as past choreography videos and songs are shared online.     There are also phenomena where overseas fans rediscover and receive praise as if they were reimported.  Euro and Parapara were complicitEurobeat and Parapara are not just a combination of music and dance. They were strongly linked by common cultural codes such as ““repetitiveness,” ““clear structure,” ““collectiveness,” and ““dramatic presentation. ” It was a perfect example of the phenomenon of ““music becoming culture through the body. ’’ Related columns[Column] Cultural relationship between Initial D and Eurobeat [Column] Memories of speed where Initial D and music intersect "

    "body": "Memories of speed where anime and music intersectText: mmr｜Theme: Cultural relationship between Initial D and Eurobeat Running music, audible sense of accelerationFrom the late 1990s to the 2000s, a Japanese anime completely changed the way Eurobeat music was viewed and listened to. That work is “Initial D. ” Why are street racing manga and anime set in mountain passes so strongly connected to high-speed dance music from Europe? In this column, we explore the cultural relationship between Initial D and Eurobeat from the perspectives of media history, music history, and subculture. The story of the mountain pass and the spirit“Initial D” is a manga by Shuichi Shigeno that has been serialized in “Weekly Young Magazine” since 1995. The story takes place on a mountain pass in Gunma Prefecture, and the main character, Takumi Fujiwara, learns drifting skills while delivering tofu in his father’s AE86 (Toyota Sprinter Trueno), and gradually awakens as a runner. It was made into an anime in 1998 and became a hot topic for its CG-based 3D car action and high-tempo music. Dance music blossomed in JapanEurobeat is a genre of dance music that developed independently in Japan from the late 1980s to the 1990s. Its origins lie in Italy and Germany’s Italo Disco and Hi-NRG, but the tempo has been sped up for the Japanese music market, and the style has changed to be catchy and energetic. Features are: Fast beats of BPM140-160 English lyrics with male/female vocals Flashy synths and repetitive melodies Emotional and “hot” sound Eurobeat was linked to the parapara culture and anime song mix culture of the 1990s, and developed uniquely to Japan. Why was “Eurobeat x Car Race” born?● Reason 1: “Resonance” between BPM and vehicle speed The tempo of Eurobeat (140-160 BPM) goes very well with the sense of speed of a car. In Initial D’s racing scenes, Eurobeat functioned as an ““aural accelerator’’. for example: “Deja Vu” (Dave Rodgers) “Running in the 90s” (Max Coveri) “Night of Fire” (Niko) When these songs are played, you can experience the speed of the car on the screen not only visually, but also through sound. ● Reason 2: Domestic anime x imported music feels like a reimportation. By boldly introducing Italian-made Eurobeat into the purely Japanese media of anime, a hybrid subculture was born that was re-imported. This structure corresponds to the globalization of anime and spreads to fandom in Europe and the United States. Initial D’s cultural influence on Eurobeat● 1. Re-evaluation/revival phenomenon Many young people were introduced to Eurobeat for the first time through “Initial D,” and songs such as “Initial D Remix” and “Drift Compilation” created buzz on YouTube. This led to a phenomenon in which songs from the 90s were revived by Generation Z. ● 2. Defining it as “running music” Eurobeat has been redefined by Initial D as “music for running”. Race, drift, acceleration, competition, thrill - all keywords are now included in the sound. ● 3. Memeization and spread to internet culture Songs such as “Deja Vu” have spread as meme material and are connected to the Internet and pop culture. Eurobeat is being reinterpreted in new ways on TikTok and MAD videos. Is Eurobeat “memory fuel”? ”Initial D” gave a story and emotion to the music called Eurobeat. It was not just ““dance music,” but an experience linked to ““accelerating youth” and ““memories of defeat and victory. ” As a result, Eurobeat became an unusually ““emotional’’ music in Japan. In other words: Eurobeat is music that speaks of speed, and at the same time, it has become a medium that tells a story of running through something while losing something. The memory of speed will never disappear ”Initial D’’ has ended, but the memories of Eurobeat are still running around on the internet. Even if the race is over, each time the music is played, the race begins again. It is also a reliving experience of our own “youth” and “impulse”. Even now, whenever I hear that sound, my heart goes crazy.

    "body": "Changes and comparisons of music media: Sales of records, cassettes, CDs, and MDs, frequency characteristics, future trends, and the emergence of Dolby AtmosText: mmr｜Theme: Historical comparison of music media and prospects for the latest technology Historical sales comparison of music mediaOver the past few decades, music media has undergone rapid technological innovation and diversification. Here we will provide an overview of global sales estimates for the major physical media: records (analog LPs), cassette tapes, CDs, and MDs. MediaCumulative global sales (estimated)Peak periodCommentsRecord (LP)About 3 billion copies (including reprints)Resurgence in the 1970s and 2010s Maximum market share in the 1970s. Recently, it is recovering due to vintage demandCassette tapeAbout 5 billion or moreMid to late 1980s It was at its peak in the 1980s and 1990s.  Popularized due to the Walkman effect. Currently nicheCDAbout 30 billion pieces or more1990s to early 2000sIt became explosively popular in the 1990s and became the world's main music mediaMD (Mini Disc)tens of millions to hundreds of millions of copies (limited)Late 1990s to early 2000sIt was particularly popular in Japan, but limited on a global scale. Currently in decline*Sales figures are estimates based on multiple sources, and there are regional and age differences. Differences in frequency characteristics and hearingRecord (Analog LP)Frequency characteristics: Approximately 20Hz to 20kHz (theoretical value) Features: Feel the overtones, warmth, and natural distortion that are unique to analog. It is easily influenced by the condition of the needle and press quality, and there is a lot of noise. Spectrogram trend: High frequencies (15kHz~) are gradually attenuated The low range is rich, but fluctuations may occur due to uneven rotation and stylus pressure. Noise (crackling, siren) randomly distributed Hearing style: Soft, smooth, and warm, with a tendency to accept noise and distortion as “taste. ” Cassette tapeFrequency characteristics: Approximately 30Hz to 12kHz for normal tape, approximately 30Hz to 18kHz for metal tape Characteristics: Depends on the magnetic properties of the tape and the quality of the head. Sound quality is likely to deteriorate due to hiss and tape wear. Spectrogram trend: High range suddenly rolls off (especially normal tape) Mid-low range is relatively stable Hiss noise of about -50dB always spreads to high frequencies Using Dolby NR reduces some high-frequency noise, but the roundness of the sound remains. Hearing: Slightly muffled, with modest high frequencies. It’s soft and warm, but the noise is noticeable. CD (compact disc)Frequency characteristics: 20Hz to 20kHz (44. 1kHz sampling) Features: Digital sound source with low noise, flat and clear sound quality. Spectrogram trend: Frequency response is nearly flat up to 20kHz Very low noise floor, almost no unnecessary sound components Even sudden sounds are reproduced without distortion. Hearing: Clear and high resolution, but analog warmth is often lacking. MD (Mini Disc)Frequency response: 20Hz to 20kHz (with ATRAC compression) Features: Sound quality is close to that of a CD, but due to the compression method some detailed information may be lost. Spectrogram trend: Low to mid range reproducibility close to CD High frequency attenuates early around 17-18kHz (effect of data compression) Transient components often appear “blurred” Hearing: Almost clear, but compared to a CD it may feel a little compressed. Current status and future trends of each mediaRecordsCurrent situation: Globally, sales of analog records are steadily recovering, centered on vintage demand and sound quality-oriented demographics. Analogue regression is particularly noticeable among young people. Future: A small but sustainable market is expected with the support of analog sound source enthusiasts. Hybrid products (analog + digital) are also available. Cassette tapeCurrent status: The once mainstream media has declined. Limited support among enthusiasts and indie scenes. Future: Niche popularity as retro culture. It survives as part of DIY music and collections. CDCurrent situation: Sales have decreased significantly due to the spread of streaming. There is still demand among certain groups (collectors and those who prefer high-quality sound). Future: Although it is shrinking as a packaged media, the key is to differentiate it through physical ownership and added value (deluxe editions, etc. ). MDCurrent status: Almost disappeared from the market. A certain level of support in Japan is also a thing of the past. In the future: It will only remain for a limited time for preservation or as a hobby. What is Dolby Atmos?Overview of Dolby AtmosDolby Atmos is an object-based 3D sound technology that goes beyond traditional channel-based surround sound and allows “sound objects” to be freely placed throughout a space. Sound image placement in the height direction is possible Dramatically improves the live feel and sense of presence of movies, games, and music Can be played in home theaters, headphones, and smartphones Dolby Atmos in music productionIn recent years, streaming services (Apple Music, Tidal, etc. ) have started distributing music compatible with Dolby Atmos, and the music industry is gaining attention. Provides a three-dimensional sound experience different from traditional stereo Freely design the localization of vocals and instruments Combined with high-resolution sound sources for a more immersive listening experience Future music media trends and the potential of Dolby AtmosChanges in mediaThe transition from physical media to streaming is almost complete The focus of the next generation is support for high quality sound distribution (high resolution, MQA) and spatial audio (Dolby Atmos, Sony 360 Reality Audio) Evolution of the experienceUsers are moving from simply playing music to experiencing spatial sound A complex market where analog regression and digital advancement coexist. Dolby Atmos is highly anticipated as a new means of expression for live performances and festival experiences. Spatial audio technologies such as Dolby Atmos are rapidly becoming popular as the “next revolution in music experience. ” The future of listening will continue to evolve from simply “listening” to “feeling as if you are actually there. ” "

    "body": "Media that preserves memories, not recordsText: mmr｜Theme: Cassette tape, a supporting role in analog music recording Portable music revolution in the analog eraThe cassette tape (Compact Cassette) was developed by Philips in 1963 and became popular throughout the world as one of the leading music media from the 1970s to the 1990s.    The advent of portable players (Walkmans)     Easy home recording     Formation of a culture of personal ownership and exchange of music  Based on this cultural background, cassette tapes became a major platform for analog music. Historical history of cassette tapes1963: Invention by PhillipsThe first compact cassette was introduced for monaural recording. 1970s: The beginning of stereo recording and high quality sound   Popularization of stereo compatible heads     Standardization of normal (Type I) tape     With the spread of portable decks, the ““Walkman’’ culture was born.  1980s: The emergence of high position (Type II) and metal (Type IV)   Improvement of tape material to improve sound quality     Improved treble characteristics and expanded dynamic range     Increased adoption in high-end audio equipment  1990s: Decline due to the spread of CDsHowever, it continued to be used deeply by some audiophiles, DIY recording culture, hip-hop and indie scenes. Types of cassette tapes and their characteristicsCassette tapes are mainly classified into four types: ListTypeTypes of magnetic materialsFeaturesTypical usesType I (normal)Iron oxide (Fe2O3)Well-balanced sound quality, but slightly inferior in treble rangeGeneral music recording, voice recordingType II (Chrome)Chromium oxide (CrO2)Excellent high-frequency characteristics and good noise reductionHigh quality recording for music playbackType III (ferrichrome)Ferrichrome mixtureIntermediate properties between normal and chromeCurrently discontinuedType IV (metal)Metal particles (metal)Boasts the best magnetic properties and high S/N ratioFor high-end audio, used for professional recordingFrequency characteristics and sound quality of cassette tapesBasic frequency characteristicsNormal tape frequency band is approximately 30Hz to 12kHz Approximately 20Hz to 15kHz with chrome tape Metal tape can be expanded to approximately 20Hz to 18kHz Recording head and equalizing   Recording and playback equalization according to IEC standards differs depending on tape type.     Realizes high frequency extension with high frequency amplification circuit (ferrite head, etc. )     Optimize bias signal (high frequency magnetic vibration) to reduce distortion and noise  Dynamic range and S/N ratioNormal type: S/N ratio of approximately 50-55dB Chrome type: Approximately 60dB Metal type: Performance approaching approximately 70dB Advantages and disadvantages of cassette tapesAdvantages   Portable and easy to handle     Self-recording and editing possible     Easy music experience thanks to the spread of cassette players     Warm sound quality unique to analog  Disadvantages   Sound quality deteriorates due to tape wear and is a consumable item.     Sound quality fluctuates due to head dirt and equipment adjustments     No need to rewind or fast forward the tape     Inferior in frequency band and S/N ratio compared to CDs and digital sound sources  Contemporary significance of cassette tape cultureIn recent years, cassette tapes have been reevaluated due to the return to analog and the resurgence of retro culture.    Demand as an indie and hip-hop release format     Original recording experience and the charm of physical media     For DIY use of recording equipment and audiophile collection.  summaryCassette tape is a format that is both convenient and analog-like, occupying an important position in the history of music media. With the improvement of materials and the development of recording technology, the sound quality has also evolved, and each type has different acoustic characteristics. Although it is not as good as digital in terms of frequency band and S/N ratio, it continues to be loved for its warm tone and ease of operation.

    "body": "What was 90s Euro music? ──A feast of dance floors and melodiesText: mmr｜Theme: The whole picture of Euro music culture in the 90s What is the true identity of the music called Euro?The ““Euro Music’’ of the 1990s was not a specific genre, but rather a general term for popular dance-pop music that developed mainly in continental Europe. The most iconic of these were ““Eurobeat” and ““Eurodance,” but other genres such as Eurotrance, high energy, and synth pop were also running at the same time. In other words, the Euro of the 1990s was the ““pop image of modern Europe’’ that fused party culture, dance music, catchy melodies, and technology. Main genre classification and characteristicsGenreFeaturesRepresentative artistEuro danceFour beat, rap + female vocals, flashy melody2 Unlimited / La BoucheEurobeatHigh-speed BPM, mainly synthesizer, mainly produced in Italy, popular in JapanDave Rodgers / DominoEurotransSimplified version of trance, melodious, pop-orientedDJ Quicksilver / Sash!High energyGay club origins, flashy beats, continued from the late 1980sPatrick Cowley / Hazell DeanItalo DanceDance pop from Italy, fusion with EurodanceEiffel 65 / PreziosoEuropopMainly pop music, with R&amp;B and Latin elements introducedAce of Base / RoxetteCommon language between Europe and pop after the Cold WarAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Europe rapidly transformed into a cross-border entertainment market. “Euro-pop sung in English” began to enter the international market even from non-English-speaking countries (such as Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden). This means that Euromusic is a musical culture that prioritizes sensory pleasure over political boundaries. Rhythm, synths, and a simple, repeatable chorus. These have become a “common language” that transcends languages ​​and borders. Mainstream success stories (1990-1999)● 2 Unlimited – “Get Ready For This” (1991) From the Netherlands. “Eurodance anthem” is often used at sports venues and commercials. ● Ace of Base – “The Sign” (1993) Swedish pop group. Ranked #1 on Billboard Hot 100 for 100 years. ● Corona – “Rhythm of the Night” (1994) Made in Italy. It was also a hit in the Latin American market, demonstrating Eurodance’s versatility. ● Eiffel 65 – “Blue (Da Ba Dee)” (1999) A masterpiece of Italo Dance. A fusion of digital voice and melody. 90’s sound distribution● CD Maxi Single Culture Multiple remixes and B-sides are included in one song, making it suitable for both clubs and homes. ●MTV Europe A base for “visual dance culture” that sells video and music as a set. ● Super Eurobeat (Japan) A series developed independently in Japan by Avex. Also linked to Initial D culture. ●Reimported disc produced in Europe and distributed in Japan Produced in Italy and Germany, planned in Japan, domestic CD (e. g. MAHARAJA NIGHT) Acceptance of the 90’s Euro in JapanEurobeat: Original development by avex    Impact on TRF, globe, and Komuro family.     At the core of Initial D and Parapara culture.  Eurodance: Disco-J-Pop hybrid  Japanese groups such as MAX and V6 have released many covers. Fusion with visual culture: Non-Western Euro culture  It was also incorporated into anime OPs and game BGM, creating a “non-Western Euro culture. ”Why did the critics ignore it? ──”Lightness” and “Anti-art”Euro music was not well received by critics for a long time. The reason is as follows:    Simple structure, shallow lyrics (often nonsensical)     Mass production/anonymity (the presence of specific artists is weak)     Commercial success = disregard for artistry  However, on the other hand, it also proves that music can reach anyone. Reappraisal and Revival: The Situation in the 2020s and BeyondIn recent years, Euromusic has been reevaluated in the following ways:    Euro dance as the origin of Hyperpop and Y2K sounds     90s return (Post-Eurodance) in the club scene     Like City Pop, Eurobeat from Japan was rediscovered by the internet generation.  In addition, 90’s Euro is reaching a new audience with increased playback on Spotify and YouTube. Euro music was “pleasure without borders”Euro music in the 1990s was a phenomenon that turned dance, pleasure, and melody into an international language, not lyrics or politics. That lightness became a weapon that allowed him to transcend genre boundaries and values. Now, once again, the “naive heat” of the Euro may be asking us a question that transcends genres and generations. Is it nostalgia or newness for you?

    "title": "[Column] Media history of film music: How did sound get from the screen to the speakers?",
    "body": "From “music to listen to” to “music to feel”Text: mmr｜Theme: Recording, playback, and experience of film music Film music is “a movie that you watch with your ears”Film music consists of musical accompaniment (background score) andIt is ““another script’’ that is used to guide human emotions along with visual images such as insert songs. While film music is part of the film itself, it is also an independent work of art that can be experienced on its own. In this article, we will unravel over time how this film music was recorded, distributed, recorded, and preserved. History of film music and the origins of recording● Silent film period (~1920s) A pianist and an orchestra provided live music at the movie theater. Therefore, ““recorded film music media’’ did not exist in this era. Film music scores have been in circulation, but there are no records of them being used as media. ● The advent of talkie films and sound recordings (1927~) Starting with [ ”The Jazz Singer’’ (1927)] (https://amzn. to/3Wn4CTH), Optical Sound was introduced, and we entered an era in which audio information (scores) were recorded on video film. Around this time, the meaning of ““soundtrack = audio material of a movie’’ became clear. ●Major media for film music: technological changes in recording and playback ■Recording on the film itself (sound on film)  Optical recording method (Optical Soundtrack)Popularized between the 1930s and 1950s. Sound is recorded as a “waveform image” on the side of the screen and played back as audio when projected.  Magnetic SoundtrackAppeared in the 1950s and 1960s. Enables stereo recording and improved dynamic range. ■Record (Vinyl LP/EP) It flourished from the 1950s to the 1980s as a medium for general distribution of film music. Contains only movie highlights and representative songs. Due to physical constraints, there are many excerpts. ■Cassette tape / 8 track It became popular as a home playback device in the 1970s and 1980s. A new way to carry movie music with your car audio or portable device. ■CD (compact disc) Since the 1980s, it has become popular as a format with high sound quality, long duration, and high flexibility in song order. It became possible to record full scores, creating a golden age for movie music appreciation. Labels specializing in soundtracks (La-La Land Records, Intrada, Varese Sarabande, etc. ) have also appeared. ■DVD/Blu-ray: Video + Music A medium for ““re-experiencing’’ soundtracks in video works. The spatial expression of music has greatly evolved with stereophonic technology such as 5. 1ch/DTS. ■Digital sound source (MP3/WAV/FLAC/AAC) Music source sales on iTunes and Amazon MP3. Independent film composers are also featured on platforms such as Bandcamp. Full scores, unreleased songs, and alternate takes can be distributed in high resolution. ■Subscription (Spotify / Apple Music, etc. ) We are now in an era where we listen to soundtracks. Create playlists for ““movie mood” and ““BGM” instead of albums. The boundary between “functionality” and “artistic” in film music is once again being questioned. flowchart TDA[ 🎞 Sound on film (1930s-1960s) Optical recording → magnetic recording.

Film score publishingScores are published for the purpose of film music performance and research. Changes in the medium from a composer’s perspective● John Williams generation (analog to CD) Analog master for orchestral recording → digitization ● Hans Zimmer generation (digital native) Complete composition, recording, and mixing using a DAW base. A score designed with media development in mind. ● Contemporary composer (distribution-driven) Compatible with YouTube, games, and streaming movies (Netflix). Mixes based on Dolby Atmos and spatial audio are also on the rise. “Separation” and “reunification” of music and imagesThe medium of film music is not simply a means of delivering sound; it is a device that can be separated from the image and appreciated on its own, or reconnected with the image to enable re-experience. Scores that give you new discoveries when you listen to them on CD (e. g. Thomas Newman’s music) A soundtrack that “evokes memories” by being separated from the images The emergence of next-generation media that is reintegrated with images, such as game music and VR How are sound memories stored?Movie music remains in our hearts as “time” in a way that is different from stories and images. And those memories are preserved through the ““media’’ of LPs, CDs, MP3s, and streaming, and are sometimes played back and sometimes forgotten. The sound that flows on the screen returns to us through the speakers. The medium is a vessel for memory and another device for reproducing the story.

    "title": "[Column] What is ambient music? Philosophy of \"sounds that exist\" rather than sounds that are heard",
    "body": "From “music to listen to” to “music to feel”Text: mmr｜Theme: Ambient, environmental music, electronic music culture theory Ambient is a genre of music that is not intended to be “actively listened to” by listeners, but rather to “exist in a space. ” He eliminates clear melodies and rhythms and instead uses sustained sounds (drones), environmental sounds (field recordings), and acoustic processing to construct auditory landscapes. This genre is extremely philosophical music that stands on the border between music and art, sound and space, perception and consciousness. From the words of Brian EnoIt was British musician Brian Eno who defined the term ambient as a musical genre. In 1978, he wrote the following in his masterpiece [Ambient 1: Music for Airports] (https://amzn. to/48shEpU): “Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting. ”““Ambient music must not force itself to be heard, but at the same time allow itself to be ignored. ’’ In other words, ambient music is not background music, but it functions like background music. It is “spatial art” that flows in the background of consciousness. Genealogy and origins of ambient● Prehistory: The germ of environmental music Eric Satie: Composer of the end of the 19th century. Presenting the concept of “Musique d’ameublement” (furniture music), music that functions like furniture. John Cage: Proposes the avant-garde idea that “the environment itself is music” with silent music “4’33”. ● 1970s: Establishment of ambient Brian Eno: First use of the word ambient explicitly. Representative works:    Discreet Music (1975)     Ambient 1: Music for Airports (1978)  ● 1980s-1990s: Fusion with electronic music Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream: Fusion with German electronics. The Orb, Aphex Twin: Reconstructing ambient from a techno to IDM perspective. The rise of Ambient House/Ambient Techno. ● Since 2000: Penetration beyond genres Expanding into video works, contemporary art, yoga, meditation, game music, and VR space. Spotify’s “chill” and “lo-fi” playlists are also affected. Architecture of sound without contourselementContentsMelodyMinimal. Often has a drone-like, floating feel. RhythmBasically absent. Even if it is, it is minimal and hard to notice. Acoustic processingReverb, delay, loop, filter, etc. Spatialization of sound. StructureThere is no clear beginning, development, development, conclusion, and the timeline is ambiguous. Sound sourceSynths, field recordings, instrument sampling, noise, etc. Listening attitudeBoth active concentration and passive absorption are allowed.  Main subgenres and their characteristics● Dark Ambient A disturbing drone, industrial texture. Artist: Lustmord, Raison d”être ● Ambient Techno Fusing techno rhythm with ambient spatial processing. Artist: The Orb, Global Communication, Biosphere ●Ambient Drone Deep immersion through sound fluctuations and minute changes. Artist: Stars of the Lid, William Basinski, Eliane Radigue ●Ambient Industrial Musicizes factory sounds and machine noises. Artist: Nurse With Wound, Coil ●New Age/Chillout Ambient music for relaxation and meditation. Enya, Steve Roach, Laraaji, etc. Ambient is spatial artAmbient music is not just background music, but is also deeply connected to the following ideas and artistic concepts. ● Minimalism and Time Art Ambient music emphasizes “stillness,” “blank space,” and “sustainability. ” Affinity with architecture and contemporary art (Mark Rothko, Donald Judd). ● Cyberpunk and the city of the future A sound that blends into the inorganic space of a futuristic city. Soundscapes from movies such as “Blade Runner” (https://amzn. to/4gzcASG) and “Ghost in the Shell” (https://amzn. to/4gy1ZaG). ● Return to nature and meditation culture Using field recordings and natural sounds, he aims to fuse man-made and natural. Strongly connected to modern mental health/meditation/slow tech. The role of ambient in modern timesGame music: Used in Silent Hill, Journey, No Man’s Sky, etc. ASMR/Meditation/Stress Relief: Also used in the mental health and wellness industries. Fusion with NFT art and generative music is also underway. Ambient is the intersection of “music” and “space”Ambient is music that is not at the center of the music, but at the periphery. It is an art that deals not with melody or rhythm, but with the transformation of atmosphere, time, sensation, and consciousness. It is a sound that transcends the framework of music and enters the silence amidst the noise of the city and the gaps between memories. Rather than hearing it with your ears, it’s a sound that you can feel in the space.

    "body": "Hybrid beat born in the cityText: mmr｜Theme: Thoughts on Drum &amp; Bass/Jungle/UK sound Drum &amp; Bass (D&amp;B) is a music genre born in London’s underground club scene in the early 1990s, and at the same time is the very rhythm of multicultural city life. Combining fast breakbeats, roaring bass lines, and reggae/dub/hip-hop/techno, they revolutionized UK music history. Its evolution has been incredible, with many branches ranging from jungle, liquid funk, and techstep to neurofunk, jump-up, and drumstep. From Jungle to D&amp;B● 1990-1993: Jungle movement D&amp;B’s roots lie in the jungle genre. This was a chaotic beat music that was a mix of acid house, rave, hip-hop, and reggae, and centered around a sampling of Amen Break. Main characters:Rebel MC / Congo Natty: Remains strongly influenced by reggae roots. Shut Up and Dance: A bridge between jungle and hip-hop. LTJ Bukem: Leads to later Intelligent D&amp;B. 1994-1997:Establishment period of Drum &amp; Bass From this time on, the name “jungle” gradually changed to “D&amp;B”. This means a more refined sound, improved sub-bass and production techniques. Its functionality as club music increases and the scene matures. Representative artists:Goldie (Metalheadz): Sublimated D&amp;B to art with the masterpiece “Timeless”. Roni Size / Reprazent: Won the Mercury Prize for  ”New Forms’’, which was a fusion of live performance and jazz. DJ Hype / Ganja Kru: Representative of jump-up sound. Aesthetics of speed, deep bass, and decompositionelementContentsTempo (BPM)About 160-180. The fastest in club music. BreakbeatUses a lot of sampling of Amen, Funky Drummer, Apache, etc. SubbaseSuper bass that resonates with your body is the core of musicRhythm structureCharacterized by syncopation, irregularity, and fragmentationSound DesignEffect processing such as filters, reverb, and distortion is very important Subgenre: The world of D&amp;B with its many faces● Jungle The origin of D&amp;B. Features ragga vocals, reggae bass, and rough breaks. ● Techstep Dark, industrial, inorganic sound. Representatives include Ed Rush &amp; Optical and Dom &amp; Roland. ● Neurofunk Evolution of Tech Step. Mainly nervous and distorted bass lines. Noisia, Phace, Mefjus, etc. ● Liquid Funk A mellow style that incorporates elements of jazz, soul, and R&amp;B. Caliber, High Contrast, Netsky. ● Jump-Up With a catchy bass and simple structure, it connects directly to the dance floor. DJ Hazard, Sub Zero, etc. ● Drumstep A subgenre influenced by halftime and dubstep. Excision, Downlink etc. The base that supported D&amp;BMetalheadz (Goldie): Combines depth and intelligence. Hospital Records (Tony Colman aka London Elektricity): The home of liquid funk. Ram Records (Andy C): Leading the mainstream. Shogun Audio (Friction): Supports a wide range of styles. Exit Records (dBridge): Developing experimental and sophisticated sounds. In addition, unofficial media such as Pirate Radio and Rinse FM played a large role in popularizing D&amp;B. Music from UK multicultural citiesBorn in multi-ethnic cities like London and Bristol, D&amp;B grew up at the intersection of immigrant, street and rave culture. Black British influence: sound system culture, reggae/dub techniques. The DIY spirit of the white working class: Pirate radio, independent labels. Intersection with techno/IDM: Squarepusher, Autechre, etc. develop D&amp;B rhythms. Fashion/LifestyleClubwear: Sportswear, nylon, caps, jerseys. Street Culture: Graffiti, skating, and junglist ideology. Visual: Futuristic and cyberpunk. Artwork is also important. Global expansion and branchingCurrently, D&amp;B reigns as the foundation of bass music around the world. Scenes are particularly established in Europe (Austria, the Netherlands), North America, Japan, and Australia. ● Featured contemporary artists Noisia (disbanded): God-level production skills. Alix Perez: A sonic alchemist who can do everything from dub to half step. Sub Focus / Wilkinson: A link between the mainstream and the underground. Drum &amp; Bass is the “heartbeat of the city”Drum &amp; Bass is more than just club music. It is the beat of anxiety, hope, speed, tension, and resistance of people living in the city. This music connects, moves, and makes people think in a divided society. Once you fall in love with the rhythm, D&amp;B will begin to flow within you. "

    "title": "[Column] Definition of punk and hardcore: the turning point of anger and expression",
    "body": "Definition of punk and hardcore: the crossroads of anger and expressionText: mmr｜Theme: Punk/Hardcore In the late 1970s, young people felt oversaturated with commercialized rock music, and ““music that is simple, rough, and above all, expresses its true feelings”’ was born. It”s punk. However, even this punk style eventually began to turn inward, sometimes formally. It was hardcore punk that once again unleashed the flames of anger. In this column, we will delve into the definitions and differences between punk and hardcore from the perspectives of music, ideology, fashion, and history. What is punk?▍Musical features    Simple chord progression (mainly 3 chords)     fast, rough rhythm     Short song duration (about 1-3 minutes)     Non-melodic, screaming vocals  Representative bands: The Ramones (US), Sex Pistols (UK), The Clash (UK) ▍Thoughts and values Anti-system/anti-authority: Distrust of the state, police, companies, religion, etc. DIY spirit: Make your own music, make records, print flyers, and perform live. **Anti-fashion yet fashionable: **Safety pins, mohawks, leather jackets, etc. ▍Cultural background In Britain in the 1970s, a recession, soaring unemployment rates, and a sense of isolation among young people became social problems. Politically, it was the nascent stage of Thatcherism. Music functioned as that counterculture. What is hardcore?▍Musical features    Faster, harder, shorter (often less than a minute)     Emphasizes the distortion of the guitar and the destructiveness of the rhythm.     Scream and shout-based vocals  Representative bands: Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Dead Kennedys (all US) ▍Thoughts and values    A form that further advances the anti-establishment nature of punk.     Introspective and ethical orientations such as the straight edge (abstinence, non-smoking, vegetarianism) movement have also emerged.     Strongly political, with messages such as anti-war, anti-discrimination, and protection of animal rights.  ▍Cultural background    Developed in the United States in the early 1980s, especially in California and Washington D. C.     Symbolic of police repression, anger towards conservative society, and violent live culture.     Violence and gangs are also an issue in some scenes.  Differences and similarities between punk and hardcoreItemPunkHardcoreMusicalitySimple, close to initial lockFaster, more destructive, more profoundMessageAnti-establishment/anti-authorityMore radical and politicalFashionMohawk, safety pin, fancy decorationsStreet-oriented, minimal, practicalRegionalityBritish (+NY) originOrigined in America (especially the West Coast and East Coast)SpiritualityAnarchy, freedomDiscipline (straight edge), inner reformLive cultureDestructive but expressiveSometimes violent and focused on group sexHowever, the two are not in a conflicting relationship. Hardcore can be said to be an evolved or branched form of punk, or rather it can be interpreted as hardcore becoming more radical as a result of trying to maintain the fundamentalist aspects of punk. Punk and hardcore from a current perspectiveSince the 21st century, punk and hardcore have been inherited in various forms. It has branched out into various subgenres such as post-hardcore, emo, crustcore, and melodic hardcore. In Japan, hardcore punk (GAUZE, Lip Cream, G. I. S. M. , etc. ) has created a unique culture. Nowadays, there is a re-evaluation among Generation Z and DIY festivals, and it continues to maintain its strength as a subculture. Beyond “rebellion”Punk and hardcore are not just music genres. Rather, it is an expression of the philosophy of ““having your own voice,’’ and it is a medium that expresses this through sound, body, and group. What these two trends ask us is not just destruction, but perhaps a guideline for the future: ““What should we resist and what should we create?’’ "

    "body": "The golden age of UK techno: a record of the sounds and struggles of the 1990sText: mmr｜Theme: UK techno culture Techno, another UK revolutionIn the 1990s, techno deepened and mutated in sound and spirit, like a child born in Detroit growing up in the UK. Britain not only embraced this music, but expanded it from the underground to clubs, raves and venues for sonic experimentation. In this article, we will cover the overall picture of 90s UK techno from the perspectives of culture, music, people, and labels. Fusion of rave culture and undergroundFollowing the ““Second Summer of Love”’ in 1988, the UK was engulfed in an explosion of acid house and rave. In the aftermath, various subspecies of hardcore, breakbeat, and techno grew underground in the early “90s. On the other hand, the end of the Thatcher government and widening economic disparity caused young people’s dissatisfaction and rebelliousness to be imprinted in music. UK techno was not just dance music, it was also a social movement armed with sound systems and illegal raves. Lineage of Innovators● The Black Dog A pioneer of Intelligent Techno (IDM). While influenced by Detroit, they develop a darker and more intelligent sound. ‘Bytes’ (1993) released by Warp Records is iconic. ● Surgeon (Anthony Child) The standard-bearer of Birmingham techno. Hard, industrial, and solid. He rose to fame with releases on Tresor and Downwards, and is still at the core of UK techno. ● Luke Slater Known as Planetary Assault Systems. Developing hard yet funky techno, released by NovaMute and others in the late 90’s. ● Regis &amp; British Murder Boys A core figure in UK industrial techno. Regis founded the Downwards label and established Birmingham’s own dystopian sound. ● Autechre Although more IDM than pure techno, they represent the intellectual side of UK techno along with Warp Records. ““Incunabula” and ““Amber” are representative works of the 90s. The mother of UK techno● Warp Records (Sheffield) Early on, they released bouncy bleep techno, and later moved to the holy land of IDM. Includes LFO, Nightmares on Wax, Autechre, The Black Dog, and more. ● Downwards (Birmingham) Founded by Regis. Together with Surgeon and others, he defined the ““Birmingham sound,’’ focusing on industrial and ascetic sounds. ● NovaMute A sub-label of Mute Records. With artists such as Luke Slater, Speedy J, and Laurent Garnier, they have spread not only to the UK but also to the techno scene throughout Europe. ● Peacefrog A label that introduced deeper, Detroit-based UK techno. The list includes Luke Slater, Stacey Pullen and Paul Mac. Rigid, experimental, and rebellious90s UK techno has the following sonic characteristics:    Influence from industrial/EBM (especially Downwards style)     Experimental structure and sound design (Warp style)     Hard and minimal groove (Surgeon, Slater type)     Internalization of social and political messages (influence of rave culture)  It should be noted that in the UK, there was a stronger awareness of not only the ““functionality” of techno, but also ““expressiveness” and ““thoughtfulness. ’’ Politics of music and spaceUK techno in the 1990s was a culture that valued the place more than the music. From illegal raves held in rural warehouses and outdoor fields to free party crews (such as Spiral Tribe) who moved around with sound systems loaded onto trucks, sound occupied physical space and shook up the existing social order. The legacy of UK technoUK techno in the 1990s pursued the radical possibilities of sound and thought while distancing itself from commercialism. Much of today’s techno, industrial, noise, and experimental music is influenced by it. UK techno from that era was played not to dance to, but to assert its existence. The reverberations of that noise still resonate in the modern underground. [Reference Disc Guide]Artist/TitleeraFormatFeaturesJustin Berkovi - Fast Wide E.

Iron-cold beats and foggy melancholy. In between, an underground frenzy was born. A former factory in Sheffield, a warehouse in Birmingham, a pre-dawn club in London - they all vibrated to the same rhythm. Techno created poetry from the reverberations of industry, presenting an aesthetic of destruction and reconstruction. UK techno sounds the “soul of the machine” while deconstructing sound and time. It is a memory of a quiet and violent revolution that continues even today.

    "body": "Nightmares On Wax”s Smokers Delight (1995), the second album from British producer George Evelyn”s project, was released on Warp Records and cemented its place in downtempo and trip-hop history. This album remains a timeless masterpiece, transporting listeners to a soothing chill-out realm, a step removed from the hustle and bustle of club culture. First of all, the core of “Smokers Delight” lies in its “relaxed groove. ” The album opens with “Nights Introlude,” featuring soft strings and a gentle beat that samples Quincy Jones’ “Summer In The City,” instantly drawing the listener into a relaxing space. Musically, the hip-hop skeleton is woven with the essence of reggae, soul, and funk, giving it a unique eclecticism. For example, in “Groove St. ,” a deep piano bass line intertwines with a smooth bassline, and the addition of light drums creates a simple yet addictive loop. Meanwhile, longer tracks like ““Pipes Honor,’’ which clock in at over nine minutes, gradually develop layers of guitar and keyboard, taking the listener on a meditative journey. The production background is also interesting. After the departure of her partner Kevin Harper, Evelyn redefined Nightmares On Wax as a solo project and found a new direction with Smokers Delight. Using analog equipment and sampling techniques, this record embodies the DIY spirit of the ’90s and resonates with the innovative attitude of the Warp label at the time. Robin Taylor-Firth’s keyboard participation and the loops of hand-played instruments scattered throughout create an exquisite fusion of digital and analog, creating a human sound that transcends artificial coldness.

The song was created over a few days during the 1994 World Cup and is said to have been born out of a drunken jam session. This background creates a light and free-spirited atmosphere in the music. Described by Paradinas as “an updated version of easy listening and funk,” melodies reminiscent of 70s lounge music and elevator music are fused with distorted beats and the whimsical tones of analog synths. These tracks are the result of a fusion of Aphex Twin”s unpredictable experimentalism and µ-Ziq”s melodic structure, creating a sonic adventure that goes beyond mere “written music”. Tracklist1.

He was interested in music from an early age, and at the age of 13, his parents gave him a DJ set, and he started DJing. At the age of 17, he began producing music on his own, creating megamixes using two track recorders. His first project was L&amp;O’s “Even Now”, but his name is not listed in the credits, and he went on to form his first collaborative project, The Beat Machine, with Patrick de Mayer. His name became widely known through his duo Quadroponia with Lucien Foort. Meanwhile, T99 was initially a solo project of Patrick De Meyer, and after releasing three albums, Patrick De Meyer heard that Olivier Abbeloos was working on a song called “Anasthasia” and suggested that they release it under the T99 name. Olivier Abbeloos agreed, and T99 started working as a duo. The two later released their only album, “Children Of Chaos”.

He produces a wide range of music including drum”n”bass, house, breaks, and electronic sounds, and in 2014 he also worked on the remix of LOST CHILD, which was included in Momoiro Clover Z”s “Furious Space Symphony - 7th Movement “Infinite Love’ (Emperor Style)”. “Yellow Brick / Raar” is a breakout house track released in 2007 by Noisia’s own label, Division Recordings. ‘Yellow Brick’ is an addictive, uplifting track with a familiar noisy bassline and a very soothing and simple beat. ‘Raar’, on the other hand, is a track that will absolutely destroy the dance floor. Where “Yellow Brick” was subdued with a simple beat and tempo, “Raar” feels like you’re getting hit in the head with a sinister bass and a crazy beat that feels intentionally off. This is a must-hear record for all noise fans, even if you don’t like house music. Tracklista. Yellow Brickaa. RaarPurchase on Mercari Youtube"

The song “Merengue” was remixed by Slam and Oliver Ho in 2002 and became a club hit. This track represents the changes in the techno scene since the release of the Detroit techno anthem “Knights Of The Jaguar” in 1999, embodying the typical sound of Detroit techno, characterized by powerful bass lines, hard beats, and psychedelic elements. Needless to say, the success of “Knights Of The Jaguar” had a huge impact on the techno scene, and many artists began pursuing harder and more aggressive sounds, leading techno to evolve into more experimental and avant-garde music. Samuel L’s ““Day n’ Night” is a representative work of techno sound after the groundbreaking ““Knights Of The Jaguar”, which was a turning point in the techno scene, and also had a great influence. Among the techno tracks from 2001, it’s a techno sound right after the millennium, with funky elements intertwined with a straight beat, a pleasant bass drum, no breaks or vocals, just music playing. This record is a great track that will definitely make any techno lover’s day out. TracklistA1. Outer Track. MerengueA2. Inner Track. Merengue (Faze)B1. Outer Track. WhithinB2. Inner Track.

He started working as a DJ as a hobby in 1983, when he was 12 years old, primarily playing early electro and hip-hop. He turned to house music in 1985, the same year that the first wave of Chicago house arrived in New York, and in 1989, while still working as a courier, he began releasing some of his early work on several small record labels in New York. A year later, they caught the attention of Belgium’s R&amp;S Records, who released their first major record, Energy Flash, by mid-1990, with a string of equally impressive releases to follow. Throughout the ’90s, he continued to create timeless music on the cutting edge label of the time. In 1999, he founded his own label, STX Records, which currently records with both JB³ and Joey Beltram. TracklistA. Game FormB1. Game Form (Robert Armani Remix)B2.

The track then takes on a more ominous aspect when the string elements come in. This EP is a very strong opener with its disturbing musical themes, and “Time After Space” has a cosmic feel. “Detached” is probably one of his best works. “Black Avenger” draws listeners in with its percussive frenzy and hard keys. A must-have for any Jeff Mills fan, this is a special record that covers many of the wide-ranging themes of Jeff Mills’ work, while still expressing the unique and powerful results of each individual song.

The band”s name, Stock, Hausen &amp; Walkman (1991-2001), is a play on electronic music pioneer Karlheinz Stockhausen, “80s mass-produced pop artist Stock Aitken Waterman, and Sony’s Walkman. When they first formed in the late 1980s, they were an experimental improvisational duo consisting of Matt Wand (the band’s godfather and founder) and guitarist Rex Caswell. During their activities, cellist Dan Weaver and drummers Richard Harrison and Andrew Sharpley participated in live performances and in the studio. In 1990, he also appeared on ““Company Week’’ at the request of Derek Bailey. Even after Caswell moved to Denmark and Weaver took a break from recording due to dance and theater work, Wand continued to work and produced perhaps their most successful albums, Organ Transplants vol. 1 &amp; 2. Sharpley also contributed musically. Wand founded and operated Hot Air Records to promote S,H&amp;W records, and released a wide range of their own work as well as that of other artists on the label. Currently, he continues to operate the label and plans, designs, and produces albums. Although the project ended in 2001, Wand continues to release “interesting” S, H&amp;W archival material on Hot Air. TracklistA1. SleepA2. UpsetA3. OrdealA4. BroccoliA5. SpotB1. FeatherB2. GruelB3.

However, Frank De Wulf offers a remix that incorporates elements of tribal house, and the “Original Mix” still retains its shine. TracklistS. The Flow M14 (G-Funk Mix)T1.
